We first develop a framework of outbreak dynamics that emphasizes transitions from states dominated by negative feedback to those dominated by positive, density-dependent feedback. We then consider mechanisms by which temperature and precipitation changes can allow populations to breach critical thresholds, and the empirical data relating outbreaks to weather. Finally, we consider how anticipated climatic change, and relationships with new hosts and natural enemy guilds, may influence dynamics in new habitats. There is strong evidence that elevated temperature can increase over-wintering survival and decrease generation times of bark beetles, although evolved traits can also constrain response to warming in some habitats. Moreover, combinations of phenotypic plasticity, genotypic variation and physiological thresholds yield a broad range of conditions under which adults emerge synchronously, and thus can mass attack trees. There is likewise strong evidence that severe drought reduces tree defences against attack. Drought stress can occur through lower precipitation and/or higher temperatures that reduce soil moisture and/or raise vapour pressure deficit. We also delineate three categories of range modifications: increased and more persistent establishment in areas where trees experienced only intermittent exposure historically; establishment in areas dominated by host species but where local populations experienced little or no pressure historically; and movement into new areas containing susceptible species that have not been exposed previously. Each of these has been documented for bark beetles. Trees in areas that experienced minor or no exposure generally had lower defences than their more historically exposed counterparts. However, there can be lags in beetle behavioural responses. In some cases, more heterogeneous forest structure, more abundant local predators and competitors and low host nutritional quality could potentially lessen risk in new habitats. Direct comparative studies are needed to evaluate outbreak potentials following range expansions driven by climate warming.",2015,Entomology; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Article; Book Chapter,NA,web_of_science,Maybe,Micah,No,Yes,No,no access to publication; probably a review paper,
1424,NA,"Hendricks, P","Spring snow conditions, laying date, and clutch size in an alpine population of American Pipits",JOURNAL OF FIELD ORNITHOLOGY,"Date of clutch initiation and mean clutch size for an alpine population of American Pipits (Anthus rubescens) in northern Wyoming varied significantly among seven years sampled during 1963-1995. Because American Pipits are obligate ground-nesters in an environment devoid of trees, I examined the hypothesis that spring snow conditions cause the annual variation in mean laying date and resulting clutch size. Mean clutch size was highly correlated with mean laying date, and both traits were highly correlated with the snow water equivalent (SWE) on I May. Reduced SWE resulted in earlier onset of egg laying and indirectly in increased clutch size. Trend analyses for 1961-2002 showed an 18% decline in I May SWE and an earlier date of snowmelt by 7 d, indicating that an earlier onset of egg laying by about 5 d may have occurred over the same period, with a corresponding increase in mean clutch size of 0.2 eggs. This result supports the global pattern for various bird species of earlier onset of nesting during the last few decades. Annual laying date and clutch size of American Pipits appear to respond predictably to short-term (annual) changes in spring snow conditions at this high-elevation location and may prove useful for projecting reproductive responses of alpine birds to changing trends in climate.",2003,Zoology,Article,American Pipit; anthus rubescens; climate change; clutch size; laying date; snow conditions; wyoming,web_of_science,Maybe,Micah,No,Maybe,No,Beartooth Mts - WY/MT,

The accuracy of the SYN downwelling solar and longwave irradiances was first assessed by comparison to measurements at NOAA's Surface Radiation Network (SURFRAD) reference stations and to remote mountain observations. Typical shortwave (longwave) biases had magnitudes less than 30 (10) W m(-2), with most standard deviations below 140 (30) W m(-2). The performance of a range of snow models of varying complexity when using SYN irradiances as forcing data was then evaluated. Simulated snow water equivalent and runoff from cases using SYN data fell in the range of those from simulations forced with irradiances from well-maintained surface observation sites as well as empirical methods that have been shown to perform well in mountainous terrain. The SYN irradiances are therefore judged to be suitable for use in snowmelt modeling. It is also noted that the SYN upwelling shortwave irradiances, and hence albedos derived from them, are frequently not representative of individual monitoring stations because of the high spatial variability of snow cover and other surface properties in mountainous regions.

For the same area, timeframe, land cover characteristics and soil properties, groundwater recharge was estimate using (i) single-station climate data with monthly PET calculated by the Thornthwaite method; (ii) single-station climate data with daily PET calculated by the Penman-Monteith method; and (iii) daily gridded climate data with spatially distributed PET calculated using the Penman-Monteith method. For each treatment, the magnitude and distribution of actual evapotranspiration (AET) for summer months compared well with those estimated for a 5-year crop study, suggesting that the near-surface hydrological processes were replicated and that subsequent groundwater recharge rates are realistic. However, for winter months, calculated AET was near zero when using the Thornthwaite PET method. Mean annual groundwater recharge varied from similar to 3.2 to 10.0 mm when PET was calculated by the Thornthwaite method, and from similar to 1.8 to 7.5 mm when PET was calculated by the Penman-Monteith method. Comparisons of bivariate plots of seasonal recharge rates estimated from single-station versus gridded surface climate reveal that there is greater variability between the different methods for spring months, which is the season of greatest recharge. Furthermore, these seasonal differences are shown to provide different results when compared to the depth to water table, which could lead to different results of evaporative extinction depth. These findings illustrate potential consequences of using different approaches for representing spatial meteorological input data, which could provide conflicting predictions when modelling the influence of climate change on groundwater recharge.

O.; Perren, Bianca B.; Saulnier-Talbot, Emilie; Wolfe, Alexander P.",Quantifying Recent Ecological Changes in Remote Lakes of North America and Greenland Using Sediment Diatom Assemblages,PLOS ONE,"Background: Although arctic lakes have responded sensitively to 20(th)-century climate change, it remains uncertain how these ecological transformations compare with alpine and montane-boreal counterparts over the same interval. Furthermore, it is unclear to what degree other forcings, including atmospheric deposition of anthropogenic reactive nitrogen (Nr), have participated in recent regime shifts. Diatom-based paleolimnological syntheses offer an effective tool for retrospective assessments of past and ongoing changes in remote lake ecosystems. Methodology/Principal Findings: We synthesized 52 dated sediment diatom records from lakes in western North America and west Greenland, spanning broad latitudinal and altitudinal gradients, and representing alpine (n = 15), arctic (n = 20), and forested boreal-montane (n = 17) ecosystems. Diatom compositional turnover (beta-diversity) during the 20(th) century was estimated using Detrended Canonical Correspondence Analysis (DCCA) for each site and compared, for cores with sufficiently robust chronologies, to both the 19(th) century and the prior similar to 250 years (Little Ice Age). For both arctic and alpine lakes, beta-diversity during the 20(th) century is significantly greater than the previous 350 years, and increases with both latitude and altitude. Because no correlation is apparent between 20(th)-century diatom beta-diversity and any single physical or limnological parameter (including lake and catchment area, maximum depth, pH, conductivity, [NO3-], modeled Nr deposition, ambient summer and winter air temperatures, and modeled temperature trends 1948-2008), we used Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to summarize the amplitude of recent changes in relationship to lake pH, lake: catchment area ratio, modeled Nr deposition, and recent temperature trends. Conclusions/Significance: The ecological responses of remote lakes to post-industrial environmental changes are complex. However, two regions reveal concentrations of sites with elevated 20(th)-century diatom beta-diversity: the Arctic where temperatures are increasing most rapidly, and mid-latitude alpine lakes impacted by high Nr deposition rates. We predict that remote lakes will continue to shift towards new ecological states in the Anthropocene, particularly in regions where these two forcings begin to intersect geographically.",2010,Science & Technology - Other Topics,Article,NA,web_of_science,Maybe,Micah,No,Yes,Yes,Rocky Mts - Outside CRB,

This retreat has been accompanied by statistically detectable declines in late-summer streamflow from glacier-fed catchments over much of the Study area, although there is some geographical variation: over recent decades, glaciers in northwest BC and southwest Yukon have lost mass dominantly by thinning with relatively low rates of terminal retreat, and glacier-fed streams in that region have experienced increasing flows. In many valleys, glacier retreat has produced geomorphic hazards, including outburst floods from moraine-dammed lakes, mass failures from oversteepened valley walls and debris flows generated on moraines. In addition to these hydrologic and geomorphic changes, evidence is presented that glacier retreat will result in higher stream temperatures, possibly transient increases in suspended sediment fluxes and concentrations, and changes in water chemistry. With climate projected to continue warming over the twenty-first century, current trends in hydrology, geomorphology and water quality should continue, with a range of implications for water resources availability and management and hydroecology, particularly for cool and cold-water species such as salmonids.

This study was conducted in the sagebrush-steppe ecosystem co-dominated by mountain big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata var. vaseyana) and perennial grasses in south-central Wyoming across two growing seasons (2004 and 2005). A dry spring in 2004 and a wet spring in 2005 provided an opportunity to evaluate the influence of precipitation timing on the magnitudes and patterns of net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) and its environmental drivers. Summer weather conditions (light, temperature, and vapor pressure deficit) for the 2 years were similar but deep soil moisture content was lower in 2004. Daily rates of NEE demonstrated a net carbon source in 2004 and a net carbon sink in 2005. Midday depression of NEE frequently occurred in both measurement years (June-August in 2004 and mid July-August in 2005) due to stomatal control restricting water loss from the system under low soil moisture and high temperature and vapor pressure deficit conditions. Across different soil moisture regimes, the controlling factors on NEE differed. Under water limitation, soil water availability (soil drought) was the main driving factor of growing season NEE regardless of weather conditions while vapor pressure deficit (atmospheric drought) was the main driver of NEE when the ecosystem was not limited by soil moisture. Nighttime NEE showed strong non-linear relationship with soil moisture but no relationship with soil temperature, demonstrating that respiratory processes in the sagebrush-steppe ecosystem were limited by soil moisture during summer. The dynamic response of NEE to two summer seasons with dissimilar spring precipitation indicates that intra-seasonal variability in precipitation and subsequent impact on deep soil moisture should be taken into consideration to explain magnitudes and patterns of NEE at diurnal to seasonal time scales.

These loops illustrate the temporal relationship between runoff and terrestrial water storage in three regional-scale watersheds (> 150 000 km(2)) of the Columbia River Basin, USA and Canada. The shape and size of the hysteresis loops are controlled by the climate, topography, and geology of the watershed. The direction of the hystereses for the GRACE signals moves in opposite directions from the isolated groundwater hystereses. The subsurface water (soil moisture and groundwater) hystereses more closely resemble the storage-runoff relationship of a soil matrix. While the physical processes underlying these hystereses are inherently complex, the vertical integration of terrestrial water in the GRACE signal encapsulates the processes that govern the non-linear function of regional-scale watersheds. We use this process-based understanding to test how GRACE data can be applied prognostically to predict seasonal runoff (mean Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency of 0.91) and monthly runoff during the low flow/high demand month of August (mean Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency of 0.77) in all three watersheds.

Although hydrological and process-based water temperature modelling approaches have been successfully applied to small catchments and short time periods, much less work has been done at large spatial and temporal scales. We present a physically based modelling framework for daily river discharge and water temperature simulations applicable to large river systems on a global scale. Model performance was tested globally at 1/2 x 1/2A degrees spatial resolution and a daily time step for the period 1971-2000. We made specific evaluations on large river basins situated in different hydro-climatic zones and characterized by different anthropogenic impacts. Effects of anthropogenic heat discharges on simulated water temperatures were incorporated by using global gridded thermoelectric water use datasets and representing thermal discharges as point sources into the heat advection equation. This resulted in a significant increase in the quality of the water temperature simulations for thermally polluted basins (Rhine, Meuse, Danube and Mississippi). Due to large reservoirs in the Columbia which affect streamflow and thermal regimes, a reservoir routing model was used. This resulted in a significant improvement in the performance of the river discharge and water temperature modelling. Overall, realistic estimates were obtained at daily time step for both river discharge (median normalized BIAS = 0.3; normalized RMSE = 1.2; r = 0.76) and water temperature (median BIAS = -0.3 A degrees C; RMSE = 2.8 A degrees C; r = 0.91) for the entire validation period, with similar performance during warm, dry periods. Simulated water temperatures are sensitive to headwater temperature, depending on resolution and flow velocity. A high sensitivity of water temperature to river discharge (thermal capacity) was found during warm, dry conditions. The modelling approach has potential to be used for risk analyses and studying impacts of climate change and other anthropogenic effects (e.g. thermal pollution, dams and reservoir regulation) on large rivers.",2012,Geology; Water Resources,Article,NA,web_of_science,Maybe,Micah,Yes,Yes,Yes,CRB - global hydro models,

Geomorphic, volumetric, stratigraphic, and sedimentologic data aided reservoir characterizations. Inferred transit-time distributions for tributary deposits are right-skewed and heavy-tailed, indicating preferential evacuation of younger deposits. The debris-flow fan is much larger than fluvial terraces on the other tributary, but mean transit times (+/-sigma) in both reservoirs are similar: 1370 +/- 2240 yr and 1660 +/- 2130 yr for fan and terrace deposits, respectively. Whereas tributary deposits are much larger than mainstem deposits at both sites, mainstem deposits adjacent to the fan have a relatively short mean transit time of 442 +/- 491 yr, but mean transit time in mainstem deposits adjacent to the fluvial terrace is much greater: 3870 +/- 6720 yr. Reservoir flux estimates indicate that most (>60%) of the debris-flow fan tributary's sediment yield enters fan storage, but only a small part (3%) of the fluvial tributary's yield enters storage at the confluence.

Concomitant cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum L.) invasions, plant community transitions and a warming climate in recent decades along grassland-shrubland-woodland-xeric forest transitions have promoted frequent and large wildfires, and continuance of the trend appears likely if warming climate conditions prevail. These changes potentially increase overall hydrologic vulnerability by spatially and temporally increasing soil exposure to runoff and erosion processes.

Tree mortality caused by bark beetle outbreaks alters carbon cycling in the first several years following the disturbance by reducing stand-level primary production and by increasing the amount of dead organic matter available for decomposition. The few studies of biogeochemical cycling following outbreaks have shown a range of impacts from small responses of net carbon fluxes in the first several years after a severe outbreak to large forest areas that are sources of carbon to the atmosphere for decades. To gain more understanding about causes of this range of responses, we used an ecosystem model to assess impacts of different bark beetle outbreak conditions on coupled carbon and nitrogen cycling. We modified the Community Land Model with prognostic carbon and nitrogen to include prescribed bark beetle outbreaks. We then compared control simulations (without a bark beetle outbreak) to simulations with various levels of mortality severity, durations of outbreak, and snagfall dynamics to quantify the range of carbon flux responses and recovery rates of net ecosystem productivity to a range of realistic outbreak conditions. Our simulations illustrate that, given the large variability in bark beetle outbreak conditions, a wide range of responses in carbon and nitrogen dynamics can occur. The fraction of trees killed, delay in snagfall, snagfall rate, and management decisions about harvesting killed trees will have major impacts on postoutbreak carbon fluxes for several decades and postoutbreak carbon stocks up to 100 years.",2011,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology,Article,NA,web_of_science,Maybe,Micah,No,Maybe,No,simulations,

AAB estimates accounted for up to 61% of the variance in AAB observed from 1959 to 1998, and were verified using a split sample calibration-verification scheme. Spatial correlation maps of gridded temperature and precipitation data provided an indication of the reliability of the reconstruction to approximate fire-conducive climate variability beyond the period of calibration. Singular spectrum analysis and analysis of variance suggested that AAB has significantly changed during the course of the past 150 years toward increasing variance. Recent 1959--1998 decadal changes in AAB of northwestern North America fitted well within an oscillatory mode centred on 26.7 years and accounting for 21.1% of the variance in the reconstruction. As in previous studies, the current findings suggest that AAB is correlated to seasonal land/ocean temperature variability and that future warming could lead to greater AAB. However, the study has the weakness of not accounting for complex interactions between climate and ecosystem processes and thus its results should be interpreted with caution. We suggest that a calibration model conducted on multiple types of fire proxies (tree rings, charcoal data, fire scars and stand-establishment records) could be relevant for addressing these weaknesses.

Effective, resilient and adaptive water resource governance requires continuing stakeholder engagement to address the complex nature of human and natural systems. Engagement is an adaptive and iterative process of education and empowerment, building relationships and trust, and facilitating collaboration. Collaborative modeling is a methodology that integrates diverse stakeholder perspectives, fosters discussions, and creates space for problem identification and consensus-based strategies and solutions to current water resource challenges. We define collaborative modeling broadly, such that it includes a wide range of systems thinking exercises, as well as dynamic models. By focusing on the relationships and interconnections in the system, collaborative modeling facilitates clarification of mental models and the communication of science. We will describe our work in two interstate basins and how it has evolved over time as these basins strive to develop collaborative governance, and find solutions for their water resource challenges.",2016,NA,Scholarly Journals,NA,proquest,Maybe,Micah,Yes,Yes,Yes,Spokane and Palouse Basins,

NIRS is a rapid and non-destructive technique that measures attributes of the chemical composition of organic materials. A training set of 76 lakes from northern Sweden, spanning a broad altitudinal gradient, was used to assess whether lake altitude and vegetation zones can be modelled from NIR spectra of surface sediments (0-1 cm) using partial least squares (PLS) regression and soft independent modelling of class analogies (SIMCA) classification. Lake altitude served as a surrogate variable reflecting differences in climatic conditions among sites. After spectral filtering using orthogonal signal correction (OSC), crossvalidated predictions explained 86% of the variance in altitude and the prediction error (root mean square error) was 78 m, corresponding to 8.3% of the gradient (390-1250 m above sea level). To evaluate the significance of NIR spectral differences between surface sediments of lakes in different vegetation zones (mountain-birch forest, dwarf shrub and alpine heath), principal component analysis (PCA) models were developed separately for lakes in each vegetation zone. Multivariate classification analysis demonstrated that NIR spectra of surficial sediments differed between lakes located in different vegetation zones. A separate sediment data set from 56 lakes was used to assess sediment ageing effects on NIR signals. Marked similarities between NIR spectra in surface sediments (0-1 cm) and sediments from 1-2 cm depth indicated that degradation of organic material following sediment consolidation resulted in little loss or change of climate-related information. Finally, to assess the ability of NIRS methods to reconstruct past climatic changes over Holocene timescales, we applied the NIRS-altitude model to sediments in a core from a small mountain lake. Estimates of mean July air temperature based on the NIRS-altitude transfer function showed similar trends compared with inferences from chironomids, diatoms and pollen from the same core. Overall, the results indicate that changes in NIR spectra from lake sediments reflect differences in climate, and that NIRS models based on surface-sediment samples can be applied to sediment cores for retrospective analysis.",2000,NA,Scholarly Journals,NA,proquest,Maybe,Micah,No,Maybe,No,simulations,

Nemani",Parameterization and Sensitivity Analysis of the BIOME-BGC Terrestrial Ecosystem Model: Net Primary Production Controls,Earth Interactions,"<ca> Ecosystem simulation models use descriptive input parameters to establish the physiology, biochemistry, structure, and allocation patterns of vegetation functional types, or biomes. For single-stand simulations it is possible to measure required data, but as spatial resolution increases, so too does data unavailability. Generalized biome parameterizations are then required. Undocumented parameter selection and unknown model sensitivity to parameter variation for larger-resolution simulations are currently the major limitations to global and regional modeling. The authors present documented input parameters for a process-based ecosystem simulation model, BIOME-BGC, for major natural temperate biomes. Parameter groups include the following: turnover and mortality; allocation; carbon to nitrogen ratios (C:N); the percent of plant material in labile, cellulose, and lignin pools; leaf morphology; leaf conductance rates and limitations; canopy water interception and light extinction; and the percent of leaf nitrogen in Rubisco (ribulose bisphosphate-1,5-carboxylase/oxygenase) (PLNR). Using climatic and site description data from the Vegetation/Ecosystem Modeling and Analysis Project, the sensitivity of predicted annual net primary production (NPP) to variations in parameter level of <b1> 20% of the mean value was tested. For parameters exhibiting a strong control on NPP, a factorial analysis was conducted to test for interaction effects. All biomes were affected by variation in leaf and fine root C:N. Woody biomes were additionally strongly controlled by PLNR, maximum stomatal conductance, and specific leaf area while nonwoody biomes were sensitive to fire mortality and litter quality. None of the critical parameters demonstrated strong interaction effects. An alternative parameterization scheme is presented to better represent the spatial variability in several of these critical parameters. Patterns of general ecological function drawn from the sensitivity analysis are discussed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]",2000,NA,Scholarly Journals,NA,proquest,Maybe,Micah,No,Maybe,No,simulations,

They are known to concentrate in cold environments as a result of progressive evaporation from warm regions, and condensation in colder regions. In this study we show that melting glaciers supply 50 to 97% of the organochlorine inputs to a subalpine lake in Alberta, Canada, while contributing 73% of input water. Tritium analyses indicated that during the mid- to late summer warm period, at least 10% of the glacial melt originated from ice that was deposited in 1950-1970, when it was more contaminated with organochlorines. This finding suggests that climate warming may cause melting glaciers to become increasing sources of contaminants to freshwaters. Organochlorines from glacial streams were largely in dissolved form because the organic-poor glacial clays had a limited sorption capacity for the more hydrophobic chemicals.",2001,"Canada, Alberta , glaciers",Scholarly Journals,"Canada, Alberta , glaciers",proquest,Maybe,Micah,No,Maybe,No,Banff,

The Banff reconstruction extends back to ad 1430 and also shows major drier intervals c. 1470-1510, the 1570s and 1615-1660.

Annual series are generated fromdaily temperature and precipitation values. In addition, homogeneous data are used from other stations and regional records to supplement the records from the local biosphere stations. Long term trends are identified over the period of the instrumental record. In general, data from the interval 1900 to 1998 show cooler temperatures in the 1920's, warmingfrom the early 1940's into the early 1950's, cooling into the1970's, and subsequent warming. At many stations, 1998 is the warmest in the instrumental record. Comparisons with the regional data sets show good agreements between the temperatureseries. The 20th century warming is approximately 1.0 C in the Riding Mountain area and 0.6 Cin the Long Point, Niagara Escarpment, and Waterton Lakes areas.There has been slight cooling in the Kejimkujik area over the past half century. Precipitation data show increasing trends inthe Kejimkujik, Long Point, Niagara Escarpment, and Waterton Lakes areas with no long term trend in the Riding Mountain area.

Use of these models, however, requires that the representation of processes and key assumptions involved be understood by the user community. This paper provides a full description of process implementation in the most recent version of the Regional Hydro-Ecological Simulation System (RHESSys), a model that has been applied in a wide variety of research settings. An overview of the underlying (Geographic Information System) GIS-based model framework is given followed by a description of the mathematical models used to represent various biogeochemical cycling and hydrologic processes including vertical and lateral hydrologic fluxes, microclimate variability, canopy radiation transfer, vegetation and soil microbial carbon and nitrogen cycling. An example application of RHESSys for a small forested watershed as part of the Baltimore Long-Term Ecological Research site is included to illustrate use of the model in exploring spatial-temporal dynamics and the coupling between hydrology and biogeochemical cycling.

A previous sensitivity study utilizing the National Center for Atmospheric Research's (NCAR) atmospheric general circulation model [AGCM; Community Climate Model, version 3 (CCM3)] to explore climate sensitivity to declining Arctic sea ice cover suggested that, as Arctic sea ice cover is reduced, precipitation patterns over western North America will shift toward dryer conditions in southwestern North America and wetter conditions in northwestern North America. Here, three complementary lines of research validate and explore the robustness of this possible climate change impact: 1) repetition of the previous sensitivity study (specified constant Arctic sea ice cover and atmospheric CO2) with an updated version of the NCAR AGCM [third Community Atmosphere Model (CAM3)], 2) investigation of the climate response to dynamically reduced Arctic sea ice cover (driven by a quadrupling of atmospheric CO2) in the coupled NCAR Community Climate System Model (CCSMv3), and 3) analysis of similar results from six other coupled climate system models. Results from the CAM3 sensitivity study are similar to those from the original study with declining Arctic sea ice cover driving up to 25% less mean annual precipitation (MAP) over southwestern North America and up to an 8% increase in MAP over northwestern North America. The seven coupled models also reproduce this same general pattern. At the time of CO2 quadrupling, Arctic sea ice cover is reduced (up to 90% in boreal winter) and MAP over southwestern North America decreases by up to 30% while MAP in northwestern North America increases by up to 40%. These results represent a significant shift in the precipitation pattern over western North America and support the findings of the original sensitivity study in suggesting that, as future reductions in Arctic sea ice cover take place, there will be a substantial impact on water resources in western North America.

The primary SBCs include 1) fields of soil characteristic (bedrock depth, and sand and clay fraction profiles), which for the first time have been consistently introduced to define 3D soil properties; 2) fields of vegetation characteristic fields (land-cover category, and static fractional vegetation cover and varying leaf-plus-stem-area indices) to represent spatial and temporal variations of vegetation with improved data coherence and physical realism; and 3) daily sea surface temperature variations based on the most appropriate data currently available or other value-added alternatives. For each field, multiple data sources are compared to quantify uncertainties for selecting the best one or merged to create a consistent and complete spatial and temporal coverage. The SBCs so developed can be readily incorporated into any RCM suitable for U.S. climate and hydrology modeling studies, while the data processing and validation procedures can be more generally applied to construct SBCs for any specific domain over the globe.

The amounts of methane emitted from inundated ecosystems in the United States can vary greatly from area to area. Seasonal temperature, water table dynamics, and carbon content of soils are principal controlling factors. To calculate the effect of wetlands (and their potential conversion to other land uses) on global greenhouse gas emissions, information on area covered by various wetland types is needed, along with verified projections of spatial variation in net methane emissions. Both of these variables are poorly known, and estimates are largely unavailable at the country level. Nationwide satellite datasets for the coterminous United States (excluding Alaska) have been combined with ecosystem model predictions of monthly net carbon exchange with the atmosphere to produce the first detailed mapping of methane fluxes from natural wetlands on a monthly and annual basis. The Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) model's predicted mean emission flux of methane from wetlands of the continental United States totaled 5.5 Tg CH4 per year. Ranked in terms of total annual flux, the 10 states with the highest predicted emissions (not considering Alaska) are all located in the Great Lakes region and the southern coastal regions of the country.

Predicted net ecosystem production (NEP) flux for atmospheric CO 2 in the United States was estimated as annual net sink of about +0.2 Pg C in 2004. Regional climate patterns were reflected in the predicted annual NEP flux from the model, which showed extensive carbon sinks in ecosystems of the southern and eastern regions in 2003-04, and major carbon source fluxes from ecosystems in the Rocky Mountain and Pacific Northwest regions in 2003-04. As demonstrated through tower site comparisons, net primary production (NPP) modeled with monthly MODIS enhanced vegetation index (EVI) inputs closely resembles both the measured high- and low-season carbon fluxes. Modeling results suggest that the capacity of the NASA Carnegie Ames Stanford Approach (CASA) model to use 8-km resolution MODIS EVI data to predict peak growing season uptake rates of CO 2 in irrigated croplands and moist temperate forests is strong.",2007,NA,Scholarly Journals,NA,proquest,Maybe,Micah,Maybe,No,No,modeling,

King",The Tension between Fire Risk and Carbon Storage: Evaluating U.S. Carbon and Fire Management Strategies through Ecosystem Models,Earth Interactions,"<ca> Fire risk and carbon storage are related environmental issues because fire reduction results in carbon storage through the buildup of woody vegetation, and stored carbon is a fuel for fires. The sustainability of the U.S. carbon sink and the extent of fire activity in the next 100 yr depend in part on the type and effectiveness of fire reduction employed. Previous studies have bracketed the range of dynamics from continued fire reduction to the complete failure of fire reduction activities. To improve these estimates, it is necessary to explicitly account for fire reduction in terrestrial models. A new fire reduction submodel that estimates the spatiotemporal pattern of reduction across the United States was developed using gridded data on biomass, climate, land-use, population, and economic factors. To the authors' knowledge, it is the first large-scale, gridded fire model that explicitly accounts for fire reduction. The model was calibrated to 1<a1> _ 1<a1> burned area statistics [Global Burnt Area 2000 Project (GBA-2000)] and compared favorably to three important diagnostics. The model was then implemented in a spatially explicit ecosystem model and used to analyze 1620 scenarios of future fire risk and fire reduction strategies. Under scenarios of climate change and urbanization, burned area and carbon emissions both increased in scenarios where fire reduction efforts were not adjusted to match new patterns of fire risk. Fuel reducing management strategies reduced burned area and fire risk, but also limited carbon storage. These results suggest that to promote carbon storage and minimize fire risk in the future, fire reduction efforts will need to be increased and spatially adjusted and will need to employ a mixture of fuel-reducing and non-fuel-reducing strategies.

After isolating the diurnally forced peaks (at 24, 12, 8, and 6 h), the power spectra are divided into comprehensive broad bands comprising the annual (80 days-1 yr), intraseasonal (20 to 80 days), slow (6-20 days) and fast (36 h-6 days) synoptic, and high-frequency (6-36 h) periods. Global maps accounting for 100% of precipitation's variance are analyzed to identify unique regional behaviors. Annual variability is strongest over regions affected by the seasonal migration of the intertropical convergence zone, as well as over monsoonal regions. The intraseasonal band displays off-equatorial evidence of the Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO), particularly in the Indian Ocean, but the MJO's rainfall is partially manifested in the slow synoptic band and at higher frequencies. The fast synoptic band is particularly strong over the oceans, while high-frequency variability is enhanced over land by more extreme surface gradients. Diurnal variance is strongest at low latitudes and is pronounced over regions with well-known diurnal circulations, including mountains and coastlines. Interproduct and intermodel differences also indicate biases of the precipitation product algorithms and convective parameterizations, including a strong bias toward low-frequency variability in the relaxed Arakawa-Schubert parameterization employed by one of the reanalyses, as well as increased white-spectral characteristics over land in the precipitation products.

In this study, the main environmental factors and phytoplankton biomass were investigated monthly from May 2011 to April 2013 in a eutrophic lake. The influence of both the mean values and variability (standard deviation) of environmental factors on the temporal stability index (TSI, measured as coefficient of variation) of phytoplankton was analyzed. Complex relationships were observed between the mean environmental factors and phytoplankton TSI: a positive relationship for dissolved oxygen (DO) and pH, a negative relationship for total nitrogen (TN) and ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N), a unimodal relationship for total phosphorus (TP), and no relationship for water temperature (WT). Mean values of DO and pH mainly influenced the stability of phytoplankton through increasing the average total biomass. However, mean TN and NH4+-N concentrations destabilized phytoplankton TSI primarily through increasing the variability of community biomass. There were also complex relationships between the variability of environmental factors and phytoplankton TSI: a negative relationship for TN, a unimodal relationship for NH4+-N and TP, and no relationship for WT, DO, and pH. The variability of nutrient concentrations mainly affected phytoplankton TSI through influencing the variability of community biomass, while their influence on the average total biomass was weak. Results in this research will be helpful in understanding the influence of environmental factors on the temporal stability of phytoplankton.",2016,NA,Scholarly Journals,NA,proquest,Maybe,Danny,Maybe,Maybe,International,,

In order to improve the utilization of water resources in such regions, water storage engineering has been considered; however, site selection and cost associated with the special karstic geological structure have made this difficult. According to the principle of the Soil Plant Atmosphere Continuum, increasing both vegetation cover and soil thickness would change water cycle process, resulting in a transformation from leaked blue water (liquid form) into green water (gas or saturated water form) for terrestrial plant ecosystems, thereby improving the utilization of water resources. Using the Soil Vegetation Atmosphere Transfer model and the geographical distributed approach, this study simulated the conversion from leaked blue water (leakage) into green water in the environs of Guiyang, a typical degraded karst area. The primary results were as follows: (1) Green water in the area accounted for &lt;50% of precipitation, well below the world average of 65%; (2) Vegetation growth played an important role in converting leakage into green water; however, once it increased to 56%, its contribution to reducing leakage decreased sharply; (3) Increasing soil thickness by 20 cm converted the leakage considerably. The order of leakage reduction under different precipitation scenarios was dry year &gt; normal year &gt; rainy year. Thus, increased soil thickness was shown effective in improving the utilization ratio of water resources and in raising the amount of plant ecological water use; (4) The transformation of blue water into green water, which avoids constructions of hydraulic engineering, could provide an alternative solution for the improvement of the utilization of water resources in degraded karst area. Although there are inevitable uncertainties in simulation process, it has important significance for overcoming similar problems.",2016,NA,Scholarly Journals,NA,proquest,Maybe,Danny,,,International,,

Most of the hydrological observation operations should be conducted manually and are time-consuming, strenuous, dangerous, and have low precision. In this study, the shortcomings of the manual observations are overcome and the uncertainties related to the radar-based flow velocity estimations by a sensor in the radar surface current meter are explored. This includes an automatic observation feature and analyses are conducted using the radar signals that are received by the instruments for the real-time observation of the signals. In this study, experiments were conducted at the Water Resources Planning Institute (WRPI) of the Water Resources Agency, Ministry of Economic Affairs, Taiwan and the surface velocity was estimated using the conventional fast Fourier transform (FFT), wavelet transform (WT), and a bandpass filter. The experimental results after signal processing using the bandpass filter were precise, when the tilt angle ranged between 20 and 40 degrees. The 10.525 GHz radar surface current meter adopted in this study is suitable for a tilt angle of 20-40 degrees; the measurement error will be relatively large if the tilt angle is less than 20 degrees or more than 40 degrees.",2016,NA,Scholarly Journals,NA,proquest,Maybe,Danny,,,International,Taiwan,

A growing body of work suggests that hydrologically restoring streams and rivers in agricultural and urban watersheds has potential to increase N and P retention, but rates and mechanisms have not yet been analyzed and compared across studies. We conducted a review of nutrient retention within hydrologically reconnected streams and rivers, including 79 studies. We developed a typology characterizing different forms of stream and river restoration, and we also analyzed nutrient retention across this typology. The studies we reviewed used a variety of methods to analyze nutrient cycling. We performed a further intensive meta-analysis on nutrient spiraling studies because this method was the most consistent and comparable between studies. A meta-analysis of 240 experimental additions of ammonium (NH4+), nitrate (NO3-), and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) was synthesized from 15 nutrient spiraling studies. Our results showed statistically significant relationships between nutrient uptake in restored streams and specific watershed attributes. Nitrate uptake metrics were significantly related to watershed surface area, impervious surface cover, and average reach width (p &lt; 0.05). Ammonium uptake metrics were significantly related to discharge, velocity, and transient storage (p &lt; 0.05). SRP uptake metrics were significantly related to watershed area, discharge, SRP concentrations, and chl a concentrations (p &lt; 0.05). Given that most studies were conducted during baseflow, more research is necessary to characterize nutrient uptake during high flow. Furthermore, long-term studies are needed to understand changes in nutrient dynamics as projects evolve over time. Overall analysis suggests the size of the stream restoration (surface area), hydrologic connectivity, and hydrologic residence time are key drivers influencing nutrient retention at broader watershed scales and along the urban watershed continuum.",2016,NA,Scholarly Journals,NA,proquest,Maybe,Danny,,,No,Global,

For man to feed himself adequately man must adjust his food production activities in line with the changes in the weather and climate. This paper elucidates the effects of climate change on regional shifts in world production of grain crops. It looks into the flood events, wet-dry conditions in certain regions in the world and the influence of these events on agricultural productivity and food security. Mitigation efforts to secure food in the world are suggested. North America now has warmer and shorter winter, increased spring run-off, drier summer and a shift in agro-climate which affects temperate crops. The production of corn and maple is now limited. In Tanzania, Africa, the climate has improved the production of maize and rice. In Australia, severe drought has transformed agriculture as the farmers switch the production of rice for the production of wine grape. Wheat production is devastated in the Indo-Gangetic Plain, so India and Pakistan are back in wheat deficit. Barley production is supported in New Zealand and Australia while it is being driven to extinction in Ethiopia. In the past 2 years, the weather has supported increased production of soybean in Brazil. In 2008, malnutrition dropped significantly in Niger Republic due to increased harvests of rain-fed grain crops. In the same year the weather favoured the production of grains in Nigeria but in Somalia, localized flood event destroyed late maize crop. Flood events at continental level affected the regions of Ethiopia, Somalia and Kenya and caused significant loss of livestock. In Asia, Afghanistan lost farmland, livestock and mills to heavy rains and flood. Central and Eastern Europe lost huge hectares of farmland with Hungary losing more land area to flood water. The Great Plains of North America lost huge area of farmland as Red River flowed over in 2006.

We present a framework to handle uncertainty in the incorporation of climate change in regional conservation planning. The framework uses expert opinion to: (1) formulate qualitative scenarios of climatic and ecological change based on expected as well as less probable but plausible futures not tied to specific model projections; (2) synthesize established knowledge of the climate vulnerability of species and ecosystems of concern; and (3) specify no-regrets climate adaptation strategies to reduce these vulnerabilities in conservation site selection.

Including climate vulnerability-based adaptation strategies in the regional site-selection process had a substantial effect on both freshwater and terrestrial assessments. Selection of high-priority sites based on these strategies generally increased the number, size, buffering, and connectivity of selected sites; included and expanded on sites selected based on standard (non-climate change specified) criteria alone; and drew more from moderately favourable sites.

Previous studies suggest a greater risk of wind erosion on arid and semi-arid lands due to loss of biomass under a future warmer climate. There have been no studies conducted to assess the impact of climate change on wind erosion in the Columbia Plateau of the Pacific Northwest United States where wind erosion of agricultural lands can cause exceedance of national air quality standards. The Wind Erosion Prediction System (WEPS) was used to assess wind erosion and PM10 (particulate matter ���������10 ������m in aerodynamic diameter) emissions under a future climate projected by downscaling 18 Global Climate Models (GCM) for a conservative emissions pathway. Wind erosion simulations were conducted at Lacrosse and Lind, WA and Moro, OR on a winter wheat-summer fallow (WW-SF) rotation and at Lind on an additional winter wheat-camelina-summer fallow (WW-Cam-SF) rotation. Each rotation was subject to conservation or conventional tillage practices for a baseline (1970-1999) and mid-21st century climate (2035-2064). A significant increase in temperature and nominal increases in precipitation were projected by an ensemble of climate models for the Columbia Plateau by the mid-21st century. Soil and PM10 losses were 25-84% lower for a mid-21st century climate, due in part to greater biomass production associated with CO<sub xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">2</sub> fertilization and warmer temperatures. The reduction in soil and PM10 loss is projected to be more apparent for conservation tillage practices in the future. Soil and PM10 losses were greater from a WW-Cam-SF rotation than WW-SF rotation when conservation tillage practices were employed during the fallow phase of the rotations. Despite accounting for differences in the length of each rotation, annual soil and PM10 losses remained higher for the WW-Cam-SF rotation than the WW-SF rotation. Soil and PM10 losses were more variable across years during 1970-1999 than 2035-2064; however, small and inconsistent differences in the coefficient of variation in soil loss between 1970-1999 and 2035-2064 suggest similarity in climate extremes which govern wind erosion.",2015,NA,Journal article,agricultural land; air quality; biomass production; carbon dioxide; climate change; emissions; fallow; plateaux; precipitation; rotations; simulation; summer; temperature; tillage; wheat; wind erosion; winter wheat,cabdirect,Maybe,Danny,Yes,Yes,Yes,Spot on,

Crayfish burrows and molluscan body fossils, abundant below and above the PETM interval, are significantly less abundant during the PETM, likely because of drier floodplain conditions and lower water tables. Burrow diameters of the most abundant ichnofossils are 30-46% smaller within the PETM interval. As burrow size is a proxy for body size, significant reductions in burrow diameter suggest that their tracemakers were smaller bodied. Smaller body sizes may have resulted from higher subsurface temperatures, lower soil moisture conditions, or nutritionally deficient vegetation in the high-CO<sub xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">2</sub> atmosphere inferred for the PETM. Smaller soil fauna co-occur with dwarf mammal taxa during the PETM; thus, a common forcing mechanism may have selected for small size in both above- and below-ground terrestrial communities.

A.",Consequences of climate change for biotic disturbances in North American forests.,Ecological Monographs,"About one-third of North America is forested. These forests are of incalculable value to human society in terms of harvested resources and ecosystem services and are sensitive to disturbance regimes. Epidemics of forest insects and diseases are the dominant sources of disturbance to North American forests. Here we review current understanding of climatic effects on the abundance of forest insects and diseases in North America, and of the ecological and socioeconomic impacts of biotic disturbances. We identified 27 insects (6 nonindigenous) and 22 diseases (9 nonindigenous) that are notable agents of disturbance in North American forests. The distribution and abundance of forest insects and pathogens respond rapidly to climatic variation due to their physiological sensitivity to temperature, high mobility, short generation times, and high reproductive potential. Additionally, climate affects tree defenses, tree tolerance, and community interactions involving enemies, competitors, and mutualists of insects and diseases. Recent research affirms the importance of milder winters, warmer growing seasons, and changes in moisture availability to the occurrence of biotic disturbances. Predictions from the first U.S. National Climate Assessment of expansions in forest disturbances from climate change have been upheld, in some cases more rapidly and dramatically than expected. Clear examples are offered by recent epidemics of spruce beetles in Alaska, mountain pine beetle in high-elevation five-needle pine forests of the Rocky Mountains, and southern pine beetle in the New Jersey Pinelands. Pathogens are less studied with respect to climate, but some are facilitated by warmer and wetter summer conditions. Changes in biotic disturbances have broad consequences for forest ecosystems and the services they provide to society. Climatic effects on forest insect and disease outbreaks may foster further changes in climate by influencing the exchange of carbon, water, and energy between forests and the atmosphere. Climate-induced changes in forest productivity and disturbance create opportunities as well as vulnerabilities (e.g., increases in productivity in many areas, and probably decreases in disturbance risks in some areas).

However, it is more likely that a changing climate would alter the distribution and the transpiration efficiency of vegetation types within a watershed. A new hydrological model in which the parameters are based on land use class (effectively vegetation type) was calibrated and verified for a watershed in the Rocky Mountains of British Columbia.

Recent advances in subalpine tree distribution can be compared with weather records, allowing an examination of relationships between tree advance and climate at a finer resolution. In general, recent subalpine forest advances in western North America, based on studies representing three climatic zones (maritime, Mediterranean and continental), have been associated with climatic periods favouring tree germination and growth, although factors such as fire and grazing by domestic livestock have had an impact in some areas.

Instead, richness increased most in wet years that followed dry years. Geographically dispersed sites receiving different levels of mean annual precipitation displayed strong differences in species composition, whereas temporal variation in precipitation at one site was not related to compositional dissimilarity, indicating that species turnover plays a key role in generating the regional relationship. Analyses of individual species' presence-absence suggest that the lagged temporal responses reflect environmental germination cues more than resource competition. These complex cues may dampen the initial impact of altered precipitation on diversity, but over the long term, turnover in species composition should lead to changes in richness, as in the regional, spatial relationship.

Our objective was to determine the quantitative relations of surface mineral-soil organic C, N, and C/N ratios to climate and soil texture across seven ecological regions that make up the conterminous USA. Up to 608 soil profiles per region and their corresponding climates were evaluated with regression analysis. The organic C pool (kg C m<sup xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">-2</sup>) in the upper 20 cm of mineral soil was positively related to mean annual precipitation, evapotranspiration and clay content in all regions.

These relations are consistent with concepts of moisture and temperature controls on detrital production, differential effects of temperature on detrital production and decomposition, and stabilization of organic matter by clay and silt. Differences in quantitative relations among regions may be related to vegetation-composition effects on soil organic matter processes, clay mineralogy, and faunal mixing of surface organic horizons with mineral soil.

Using information-theoretic model selection criteria, I found that LDD increased during periods of low average body condition and low spatial variation in body condition.

Despite concerns that plants and pollinators might be at risk of such decoupling, there have been few attempts to test this hypothesis using detailed phenological data on insect emergence and flowering at the same localities. In particular, there are few data sets on pollinator flight seasons that are independent of flowering phenology, because pollinators are typically collected at flowers. To address this problem, we established standardized nesting habitat (trap nests) for solitary bees and wasps at sites along an elevational gradient in the Rocky Mountains, and monitored emergence during three growing seasons. We also recorded air temperatures and flowering phenology at each site. Using a reciprocal transplant experiment with nesting bees, we confirmed that local environmental conditions are the primary determinants of emergence phenology. We were then able to develop phenology models to describe timing of pollinator emergence or flowering, across all sites and years, as a function of accumulated degree-days. Although phenology of both plants and insects is well described by thermal models, the best models for insects suggest generally higher threshold temperatures for development or diapause termination than those required for plants. In addition, degree-day requirements for most species, both plants and insects, were lower in locations with longer winters, indicating either a chilling or vernalization requirement that is more completely fulfilled at colder sites, or a critical photoperiod before which degree-day accumulation does not contribute to development. Overall, these results suggest that phenology of plants and trap-nesting bees and wasps is regulated in similar ways by temperature, but that plants are more likely than insects to advance phenology in response to springtime warming. We discuss the implications of these results for plants and pollinators, and suggest that phenological decoupling alone is unlikely to threaten population persistence for most species in our study area.",2011,NA,Journal article,air temperature; altitude; climate change; diapause; emergence; environmental factors; flowering; grasslands; meadows; models; phenology; pollinators; temperature; timing,cabdirect,Maybe,Meghan,,,No,CO,

Here we show that a dominant, relatively na������ve, high-elevation species, whitebark pine, has inferior defenses against mountain pine beetle compared with its historical lower-elevation host, lodgepole pine. Lodgepole pines respond by exuding more resin and accumulating higher concentrations of toxic monoterpenes than whitebark pine, where they co-occur. Furthermore, the chemical composition of whitebark pine appears less able to inhibit the pheromonal communication beetles use to jointly overcome tree defenses. Despite whitebark pine's inferior defenses, beetles were more likely to attack their historical host in mixed stands. This finding suggests there has been insufficient sustained contact for beetles to alter their complex behavioral mechanisms driving host preference. In no-choice assays, however, beetles readily entered and tunneled in both hosts equally, and in stands containing less lodgepole pine, attacks on whitebark pines increased. High-elevation trees in pure stands may thus be particularly vulnerable to temperature-driven range expansions. Predators and competitors were more attracted to volatiles from herbivores attacking their historical host, further increasing risk in less coevolved systems. Our results suggest cold temperatures provided a sufficient barrier against herbivores for high-elevation trees to allocate resources to other physiological processes besides defense.

If harvesting is located to mitigate long-distance insect dispersal, there is potential for a win-win outcome in which both timber production and forest conservation can be increased. This spatially targeted harvesting strategy lowers the cost of providing disturbance-mitigating ecosystem services, because valuable timber products are also produced. Mitigating long-distance dispersal also produces net gains in forest conservation across various stakeholder groups.

Their large size suggests a dispersal phenotype exploiting newly available territory. DNA evidence links the 11 290-year-old bison to Clade 1, which includes modern B. bison. This supports in situ evolution of B. bison from B. antiquus through the intermediate usually called B. ""occidentalis''. Bison of B. ""occidentalis'' character appeared in Alberta about 10 ka BP, and the DNA evidence counters the suggestion of a migratory wave from Beringia.

As such, water management in regional mountain aquifer systems, particularly in light of future projected climate change, requires an understanding of hydrogeological processes, including the complex linkages between surface and subsurface hydrology. This paper provides a brief overview of hydrogeological processes in temperate mountain regions, focusing primarily on sources of recharge to valley-bottom (or basin-bottom) aquifers. Recharge modelling in two case study areas in British Columbia (BC), Canada indicates that diffuse recharge to valley-bottom aquifers in these settings is, in general, very low (< 12% of annual precipitation in Oliver and < 24% in Grand Forks). Under current climate conditions, all recharge models show peak diffuse recharge in March and April coincident with snowmelt. Recharge declines through the summer and fall months (July through October) and attains the lowest values in January and February (when the ground is frozen and covered by snow). Future climate change in southern BC, estimated from multiple downscaled global climate models (GCMs), suggests minor increases in annual recharge due the shift (earlier) of peak recharge from increased temperature affecting earlier valley-bottom snowmelt and ground thaw. Summer recharge, currently augmented by irrigation return flow, may become more so in future due to a longer growing season assuming irrigation efficiency does not improve and crop types remain the same. Valley-bottom aquifers can receive indirect recharge through interaction with rivers. In southern BC, climate change projections suggest that peak discharge will occur earlier, winter discharge may increase, and the summer low flow period will be longer and with lower baseflow. Groundwater levels in valley-bottom aquifers will respond accordingly.",2011,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Water Resources,Article; Book Chapter,NA,web_of_science,NA,Meghan,,,No,Book not available,

Debris-flow to flood-streamflow sedimentation events following the 1988 fires in the Yellowstone National Park area (Wyoming and Montana, USA) have allowed us to examine the geomorphological response to fire in a mountain environment. Abundant analogous deposits in older alluvial fan sequences bear witness to past fire-related sedimentation events in northwestern Yellowstone, and radiocarbon dating of these events yields a detailed chronology of fire-related sedimentation for the past 3,500 years. We find that alluvial fans aggrade during periods of frequent fire-related sedimentation events, and we interpret these periods as subject to drought or high climatic variability. During wetter periods, sediment is removed from alluvial fan storage and transported down axial streams, resulting in floodplain aggradation. The dominant alluvial activity is strongly modulated by climate, with fire acting as a drought-actuated catalyst for sediment transport.",1992,Science & Technology - Other Topics,Article,NA,web_of_science,NA,Meghan,,,No,Yellowstone RB,

Palaeozoological (archaeological and palaeontological) data indicate bighorn were present in many areas there during most of the last 10,000 years. Bighorn occupied the xeric shrub-steppe habitats of the Channeled Scablands, likely because the Scablands provided the steep escape terrain bighorn prefer. The relative abundance of bighorn is greatest during climatically dry intervals and low during a moist period. Bighorn remains tend to increase in relative abundance over the last 6000 years. Bighorn were present in eastern Washington in the nineteenth century, but were largely locally extirpated by the twentieth century. A collection of prehistoric bighorn astragali that likely includes specimens spanning the terminal Pleistocene and the entire Holocene consists of specimens that are, with one exception, the same size as a collection of modern bighorn astragali from Wyoming. The single exceptionally large specimen falls in the middle of the size range of specimens from the late Pleistocene of northern Wyoming, suggesting that Washington's prehistoric bighorn, like those from other areas, were larger than modern bighorn.

The extent to which these investments also constitute significant acquisitions of water is the subject of this paper. It is apparent that water availability is a strong driver of the recent surge of investments in agricultural land globally, and in general the investments occur in countries with significant 'untapped' water resources. Ethiopia is no exception. We propose that the perception of unused and abundant water resources, as captured in dominant narratives, that drives and justifies both foreign and domestic investments, fails to reflect the more complex reality on the ground. Based on new collections of lease information and crop modelling, we estimate the potential additional water use associated with foreign investments at various scales. As a consequence of data limitations our analyses provide only crude estimates of consumptive water use and indicate a wide range of possible water consumption depending on exactly how foreign direct investment (FDI) development scenarios unfold. However, they do suggest that if all planned FDI schemes are implemented and expanded in the near future, additional water consumption is likely to be comparable with existing water use in non-FDI irrigation schemes, and a non-trivial proportion of the country's water resources will be effectively utilised by foreign entities. Hence, additional water use as well as local water scarcity ought to be strong considerations in regulating or pricing land leases. If new investments are to increase local food and water security without compromising local and downstream water availability they should be designed to improve often very low agricultural water productivity, and to safeguard access of local populations to water.",2012,"Large-Scale Land Acquisitions , Biofuels , Water , Institutions , Livelihoods;Ghana",Scholarly Journals,"Large-Scale Land Acquisitions , Biofuels , Water , Institutions , Livelihoods;Ghana",proquest,NA,Meghan,,,No,Ethiopia,

Using comprehensive, homogeneity-adjusted temperature records from over 1000 high elevation stations across the globe, we examine the causes of changing temperature trends with elevation, assessing the roles of free atmospheric change, topography (exposure and aspect), and cryospheric feedback. The data show that observed 20th century temperature trends are most rapid near the annual 0������C isotherm due to snow-ice feedback. Mountain summit and freely draining slope sites are dominated by free-air advection and thus have consistent trend magnitudes, with reduced inter-site variance in comparison with incised valley sites where local factors are more important. Thus, while there has been no simplistic elevational increase in warming rates, some generalizations can be made. Water resources and ecosystems near the 0������C isotherm in the extratropics are at increased risk from accelerated warming. The data also suggest that exposed mountain summits, away from the effects of urbanization and topographic sheltering, may provide a relatively unbiased record of the planet's climate.",2008,NA,Journal article,amplification; atmosphere; climate; climate change; ecosystems; exposure; global warming; models; mountains; periglacial features; slope; topography; urbanization; valleys; water resources,cabdirect,NA,Meghan,,,No,Global,

Among the three TEM simulations, we compared the mean monthly and interannual variability of three carbon fluxes: 1) net primary production (NPP), 2) heterotrophic respiration (Rh ), and 3) net ecosystem production (NEP). Cumulative changes in vegetation, soil, and total carbon storage among the simulations were also compared. This study supports the conclusion that the terrestrial carbon cycle is accelerating in the WALE region, with more rapid turnover of carbon for simulations driven by two of the three climates. The temperature differences among the climate datasets resulted in annual estimates of NPP and Rh that varied by a factor of 2.5 among the simulations. There is much spatial variability in the temporal trends of NPP and Rh across the region in the simulations driven by different climates, and the spatial pattern of trends is quite different among simulations. Thus, this study indicates that the overall response of NEP in simulations with TEM across the WALE region depends substantially on the temporal trends in the climate dataset used to drive the model. Similar to the recommendations of other studies in the WALE project, this study indicates that coupling methodologies should use anomalies of future climate model simulations to alter the climate of more trusted datasets for purposes of driving ecosystem models of carbon dynamics.

Upon deglaciation (ca. 11500 BP), Skinny Lake became an embayment of an ice-dammed lake. High clastic sedimentation rates, an unstable landscape, and cool, possibly wet conditions likely persisted until the early Holocene (ca. 9000 BP). From ca. 9000-8300 BP declining lake levels coupled with warm and dry conditions resulted in the formation of a prominent marl bed. A colonizing shrub and herb assemblage persisted from 9000 BP until about 8300 BP when it was replaced by a spruce (Picea) and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) forest under slightly cooler and moister conditions. The middle Holocene was warmer-than-present, however, decreasing temperature and increasing precipitation trends characterize the period from ca. 6000 BP-3000 BP. The transition to modern climate at 3000 BP is evident primarily in the lithostratigraphic record and corresponds with the initiation of the Tiedemann glacial advance (ca. 3300 BP) in the south-coastal mountains of British Columbia. A significant change in fossil pollen occurs at ca. 2400 BP and is characterised by an increase in pine pollen accompanied by decreases in alder (Alnus), spruce and fir. This also coincides with an increase in west-sourced exotic western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) and cedar type (Cupressaceae) pollen possibly transported by regional changes in air mass circulation patterns associated with Aleutian Low dynamics. This study demonstrates that both lithostratigraphic and biotic proxies are helpful in reconstructing the timing and nature of climate change and that each may have varying sensitivities to a particular type of change.",2002,"Alders , Canada, British Columbia, Skinny L. , Firs , Pacific hemlock , Rocky mountain fir , Spruces , Subalpine fir , Western hemlock",Scholarly Journals,"Alders , Canada, British Columbia, Skinny L. , Firs , Pacific hemlock , Rocky mountain fir , Spruces , Subalpine fir , Western hemlock",proquest,NA,Meghan,,,No,,

The WCD gave particular emphasis to the challenges of properly resettling populations physically displaced by dams, and estimated the total number of people directly displaced at 40-80 million. Less attention has been given, however, to populations living downstream of dams whose livelihoods have been affected by dam-induced alterations of river flows. By substantially changing natural flow patterns and blocking movements of fish and other animals, large dams can severely disrupt natural riverine production systems - especially fisheries, flood-recession agriculture and dry-season grazing. We offer here the first global estimate of the number of river-dependent people potentially affected by dam-induced changes in river flows and other ecosystem conditions. Our conservative estimate of 472 million river-dependent people living downstream of large dams along impacted river reaches lends urgency to the need for more comprehensive assessments of dam costs and benefits, as well as to the social inequities between dam beneficiaries and those potentially disadvantaged by dam projects. We conclude with three key steps in dam development processes that could substantially alleviate the damaging downstream impacts of dams.",2010,"Dams , Rivers , Dam-Affected People , Inland Fisheries , Flood-Plain Agriculture , Food Security , Poverty Alleviation , Water Resources Development , Hydropower , Environmental Flows , Ecosystemservices.",Scholarly Journals,"Dams , Rivers , Dam-Affected People , Inland Fisheries , Flood-Plain Agriculture , Food Security , Poverty Alleviation , Water Resources Development , Hydropower , Environmental Flows , Ecosystemservices.",proquest,NA,Adrienne,Maybe,No,No,not about climate change,

In this paper we aim to start filling that gap by combining insights from the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework and value chain analysis. Specifically we study food, energy and water value chains as networks of action situations (NAS) where actors? decisions depend not only on the institutional structure of a particular situation but also on the decisions made in related situations. Although the IAD framework has developed a solid reputation in the policy sciences, empirical applications of the related NAS concept are rare. Value-chain analysis can help drawing the empirical boundaries of NAS as embedded in production processes. In this paper we first use value-chain analysis to identify important input-output linkages among water, food and energy production processes, and then apply the IAD-NAS approach to better understand the effect of institutions within and across those processes. The resulting combined framework is then applied to four irrigation-related case studies including: the use of energy for water allocation and food production in an irrigation project in Spain; the production and allocation of treated water for food and bioenergy production in Germany; the allocation of water for food production and urban use in Kenya; and the production and allocation of energy for food production in Hyderabad, India. The case analyses reveal the value of the framework by demonstrating the importance of establishing linkages across energy, water and food-related situations and the ways in which institutions limit or facilitate synergies along the value chains.",2015,"Water-Energy-Food Nexus , Institutional Analysis And Development Framework , Socio-Ecological Systems Framework , Value-Chain Analysis , Irrigationcases",Scholarly Journals,"Water-Energy-Food Nexus , Institutional Analysis And Development Framework , Socio-Ecological Systems Framework , Value-Chain Analysis , Irrigationcases",proquest,NA,Adrienne,No,Maybe,No,,

The streambed Kv values of a total number of 385 locations from five test sites were estimated on the basis of in situ falling-head standpipe permeameter tests. The difference of Kv values for all test locations reaches five orders of magnitude with a range from 5.87E-04 to 61.3 m/d and a median value of 1.62E-01 m/d. The streambed Kv values are neither normally nor log-normally distributed, but display significant spatial variability among the five test sites. The highest Kv values occur at the site with mainly sandy sediment, while the Kv values at the other four sites with mainly silt-clay sediment are relatively close and have less variability than those at the sandy sediment site. The median Kv values from all of the sites exhibit no statistically significant temporal trends. However, the median Kv values indeed show temporal variations that might be influenced by changes in silt-clay content of the sediment, especially for the sandy sediment site and the combined data from all sites. Weak evidence demonstrates that streambed Kv values decrease with depth.",2016,NA,Scholarly Journals,NA,proquest,NA,Adrienne,,,International,,

In the C���nyoles watershed, Valencia, we analysed the consequences of change from surface irrigation to drip irrigation over the past 25 years. There were a number of transformations resulting from, or accelerated by, this change including the 1) intensification of well construction causing a redistribution in access to groundwater, water shortages and a lowering of the groundwater table; 2) expansion of irrigation into former rain-dependent uphill areas resulting in increased water use; 3) shift to higher- value monoculture fruit crops, but with associated higher crop water requirements; 4) increased electrical energy consumption and higher costs due to groundwater pumping; and 5) loss of cultural heritage as wells have replaced traditional surface irrigation infrastructure that originated in the Middle Ages. Consequently, the authors argue that transitioning from surface irrigation to drip irrigation should critically look beyond the obvious short-term benefits that are intended by the introduction of the technology, and consider possible unforeseen side effects, that may have serious long-term impacts on the environment and the community.",2017,"Drip Irrigation , Water Saving , Energy Consumption , Agricultural Land Use/expansion , Cultural Heritage Loss , C���nyoles Watershed;Spain",Scholarly Journals,"Drip Irrigation , Water Saving , Energy Consumption , Agricultural Land Use/expansion , Cultural Heritage Loss , C���nyoles Watershed;Spain",proquest,NA,Adrienne,,,International,,

Though knowledge and understanding has steadily evolved about the nature and extent of many of the physical effects of possible climate change on water resources, much less is known about the economic responses and impacts that may emerge. Methods and results are presented that examine and quantify many of the important economic consequences of possible climate change on U.S. water resources. At the core of the assessment is the simulation of multiple climate change scenarios in economic models of four watersheds. These Water Allocation and Impact Models (Water-AIM) simulate the effects of modelled runoff changes under various climate change scenarios on the spatial and temporal dimensions of water use, supply, and storage and on the magnitude and distribution of economic consequences. One of the key aspects and contributions of this approach is the capability of capturing economic response and adaptation behaviour of water users to changes in water scarcity. By reflecting changes in the relative scarcity (and value) of water, users respond by changing their patterns of water use, intertemporal storage in reservoirs, and changes in the pricing of water. The estimates of economic welfare change that emerge from the Water-AIM models are considered lowerbound estimates owing to the conservative nature of the model formulation and key assumptions. The results from the Water-AIM models form the basis for extrapolating impacts to the national level. Differences in the impacts across the regional models are carried through to the national assessment by matching the modelled basins with basins with similar geographical, climatic, and water use characteristics that have not been modelled and by using hydrologic data across all U.S. water resources regions. The results from the national analysis show that impacts are borne to a great extent by nonconsumptive users that depend on river flows, which rise and fall with precipitation, and by agricultural users, primarily in the western United States, that use a large share of available water in relatively low-valued uses. Water used for municipal and industrial purposes is largely spared from reduced availability because of its relatively high marginal value. In some cases water quality concerns rise, and additional investments may be required to continue to meet established guidelines.",2004,NA,Journal article,climate change; economic impact; runoff; simulation models; stream flow; surface water; water allocation; water availability; water deficit; water quality; water resources; water supply; water use; watershed management; watersheds,cabdirect,NA,Adrienne,No,Yes,No,US-scale with case studies in other major river basins (not CRB),

Here we apply the suite of 12 potential climate change scenarios, previously described in Part 1, to the Hydrologic Unit Model of the United States (HUMUS) to simulate water supply in the conterminous United States in reference to a baseline scenario. We examine the sufficiency of this water supply to meet changing demands of irrigated agriculture. The changes in water supply driven by changes in climate will likely be most consequential in the semi-arid western parts of the country where water yield is currently scarce and the resource is intensively managed. Changes of greater than ������50% with respect to present day water yield are projected in parts of the Midwest and Southwest U.S. Interannual variability in the water supply is likely to increase where conditions become drier and to decrease under wetter conditions.",2005,NA,Journal article,agriculture; atmosphere; carbon dioxide; climate change; environmental assessment; environmental impact; evaporation; evapotranspiration; geographical information systems; geographical variation; global warming; hydrology; irrigated farming; latitude; precipitation; runoff; seasonal variation; simulation models; temperature; temporal variation; water management; water resources; water supply; water yield; weather patterns,cabdirect,NA,Adrienne,No,Yes,No,US-scale,

Changes in climate directly affect fire frequency and severity. As a result of climate change, a significant increase in fire occurrence and behaviour is predicted to occur over the next 70 years. Climate change will also directly impact the composition of current ecosystems by shifting the fundamental niche of species to higher elevations and/or latitudes, with the changes being most apparent in temperate and boreal latitudes and on mountains in the tropics and subtropics. The alteration and shift of forest ecosystems will be facilitated by an increase in the frequency and severity of forest fires, as these ecosystem disturbances will create the opportunity for the development of new ecosystems. Warmer, drier conditions, coupled with a change in fire behaviour will reduce the resilience of existing ecosystems. The reduced ability to resist and/or recover from disturbance will result in the reduction or complete loss of ecosystem structures required by the fauna and flora that constitute the biodiversity we currently know today. Areas of climatic refuge that exist within landscapes may maintain the ecosystem structures required for some species in the face of direct climate change impacts. Areas that act as both fire and climatic refugia will provide habitat for biodiversity associated with late-successional forests. Species that require late-successional habitat in ecosystems that are intolerant of fire or drought are at greatest risk to climate change and its interaction with fire. The current composition of biodiversity within forested landscapes will change over time and space as species and habitat are both lost and gained in direct or indirect response to climate change.",2006,NA,Journal article,biodiversity; climate change; ecosystems; Forest fires; forests; Species diversity; Species richness,cabdirect,NA,Adrienne,No,Yes,No,review; not geographically specific but might have interesting information,

The (seasonal) timing of runoff in these areas is especially sensitive to projected losses of snowpack associated with warming trends, whereas projected (annual) runoff volume changes are primarily associated with precipitation changes, and to a lesser extent, with changes in evapotranspiration (ET). Regional studies in the USA (and especially the western USA) suggest that hydrologic adjustments to a warming climate have been ongoing since the mid-twentieth century. We extend the insights extracted from the western USA to the global scale using a physically based hydrologic model to assess the effects of systematic changes in precipitation and temperature on snow-affected portions of the global land area as projected by a suite of global climate models. While annual (and in some cases seasonal) changes in precipitation are a key driver of projected changes in annual runoff, we find, as in the western USA, that projected warming produces strong decreases in winter snow accumulation and spring snowmelt over much of the affected area regardless of precipitation change. Decreased snowpack produces decreases in warm-season runoff in many mid- to high-latitude areas where precipitation changes are either moderately positive or negative in the future projections. Exceptions, however, occur in some high-latitude areas, particular in Eurasia, where changes in projected precipitation are large enough to result in increased, rather than decreased, snow accumulation. Overall, projected changes in snowpack and the timing of snowmelt-derived runoff are largest near the boundaries of the areas that currently experience substantial snowfall, and at least qualitatively, they mirror the character of observed changes in the western USA.",2009,NA,Journal article,air temperature; climate change; global warming; hydrology; latitude; meltwater; models; precipitation; runoff,cabdirect,NA,Adrienne,No,Yes,No,Global,

For the interior variety, low precipitation and high growing season temperatures limited growth. Based on these relationships, we chose a simple heat moisture index (growing season temperature divided by precipitation of the preceding winter and current growing season) to predict growth response for the interior variety. For 105 tree ring chronologies or 81% of the interior samples, we found significant linear correlations with this heat moisture index, and moving correlation functions showed that the response was stable over time (1901-1980).

We assembled 18 temperature time-series from sites on regulated and unregulated streams in the northwest U.S. to describe historical trends from 1980-2009 and assess thermal consistency between these stream categories. Statistically significant temperature trends were detected across seven sites on unregulated streams during all seasons of the year, with a cooling trend apparent during the spring and warming trends during the summer, fall, and winter. The amount of warming more than compensated for spring cooling to cause a net temperature increase, and rates of warming were highest during the summer (raw trend=0.17������C/decade; reconstructed trend=0.22������C/decade). Air temperature was the dominant factor explaining long-term stream temperature trends (82-94% of trends) and inter-annual variability (48-86% of variability), except during the summer when discharge accounted for approximately half (52%) of the inter-annual variation in stream temperatures. Seasonal temperature trends at eleven sites on regulated streams were qualitatively similar to those at unregulated sites if two sites managed to reduce summer and fall temperatures were excluded from the analysis. However, these trends were never statistically significant due to greater variation among sites that resulted from local water management policies and effects of upstream reservoirs. Despite serious deficiencies in the stream temperature monitoring record, our results suggest many streams in the northwest U.S. are exhibiting a regionally coherent response to climate forcing. More extensive monitoring efforts are needed as are techniques for short-term sensitivity analysis and reconstructing historical temperature trends so that spatial and temporal patterns of warming can be better understood.

Growth responses were assessed by comparing tree-ring measurements from trees in stands burned repeatedly during the 20th century at roughly the historical fire frequency with trees in paired control stands that had not burned for at least 70 years. Contrary to expectations, only one site showed significant increases in long-term growth responses in burned stands compared with control stands. Short-term responses showed a trend of increasing negative effects of wildfire (reduced diameter growth in the burned stand compared with the control stand) in recent years that had drier winters and springs. There was no effect of time since the previous fire on growth responses to fire.

Using both tower-based and remotely sensed data sets, we show that natural disturbances from wildfire, beetle outbreaks, and hurricane wind throw can significantly alter surface albedo, and the associated radiative forcing either offsets or enhances the CO<sub xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">2</sub> forcing caused by reducing ecosystem carbon sequestration over multiple years. In the examined cases, the radiative forcing from albedo change is on the same order of magnitude as the CO<sub xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">2</sub> forcing. The net radiative forcing resulting from these two factors leads to a local heating effect in a hurricane-damaged mangrove forest in the subtropics, and a cooling effect following wildfire and mountain pine beetle attack in boreal forests with winter snow.

Aquatic and moisture-sensitive species, such as amphibians, may be particularly vulnerable to these modified disturbance regimes because large wildfires often occur during extended droughts and thus may compound environmental threats. However, understanding of the effects of wildfires on amphibians in forests with long fire-return intervals is limited. Numerous stand-replacing wildfires have occurred since 1988 in Glacier National Park (Montana, U.S.A.), where we have conducted long-term monitoring of amphibians. We measured responses of 3 amphibian species to fires of different sizes, severity, and age in a small geographic area with uniform management. We used data from wetlands associated with 6 wildfires that burned between 1988 and 2003 to evaluate whether burn extent and severity and interactions between wildfire and wetland isolation affected the distribution of breeding populations. We measured responses with models that accounted for imperfect detection to estimate occupancy during prefire (0-4 years) and different postfire recovery periods.

Wildfire risk, defined as expected residential losses from wildfire [E(RLW)], depends on the number of residential properties on parcels, the probability that parcels burn, the probability of wildfire losses to residential structures on properties given the parcels on which those properties are located burn, the average percentage of wildfire-related losses in aesthetic values of residential properties, and the total value (structures plus land) of residential properties.

Across 25 fires in five National Forests (Uinta-Wasatch-Cache NF, Ashley NF, Fishlake NF, Dixie NF, and Manti-La Sal NF) in the state of Utah, we examined aspen regeneration and recruitment levels, and wildlife and livestock fecal group counts along belt transects that spanned gradients of fire size and severity. Forest cover change was assessed by comparing pre-fire and post-fire satellite images. The fires dated from 1992 to 2002 and were at least 10 years old when this study was conducted. Fire size and severity were positively related to aspen regeneration (density of saplings) and recruitment (saplings &gt;2 m in height).

The goal of this research was to determine the impact of soil C changes, induced through replacing the fallow period with rapeseed in rotation with wheat, and the effects it would have on emission of greenhouse gases (GHG) of rapeseed HRJ. Methods: The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (Tier 1) method was used with modifications to determine the changes in soil C of wheat-wheat-rapeseed (WWR) relative to the reference wheat-wheat-fallow (WWF) rotation for 20 years of cultivation. The 27 case scenarios were conducted to study the impacts of changes in management practices (tillage practice and residue input) on changes in soil C for WWR rotation in multiple locations in 10 US states. The CO<sub xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">2</sub> emissions resulting from soil C changes were incorporated into the rapeseed HRJ pathway in order to evaluate the GHG emissions. Results and discussion: Introducing rapeseed to replace the fallow period with wheat could either increase or decrease changes in soil C, depending on management practices. Soil C is predicted to increase with increased residue input and reduced tillage. The greatest gain of soil C was found when using high residue input for wheat and rapeseed under no tillage, resulting in the best management practice. Conversely, adding low residue input to both crops with full tillage created the highest loss of soil C, referring to as the worst management practice. Soil C changes varied across locations from -0.22 to 0.32 Mg C ha<sup xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">-1</sup>year<sup xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">-1</sup>. Consequently, the GHG emissions of rapeseed HRJ ranged from 4 to 70 g CO<sub xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">2</sub> eq./MJ, comparing to 46 g CO<sub xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">2</sub> eq./MJ for excluding soil C change. The rapeseed HRJ exhibited the GHG savings of 65-96% for the best practice and 20-42% for the worst practice when compared to petroleum jet fuel. Conclusions and recommendations: Based on results using the modified IPCC method, adoption of high residue input with no tillage for the rotation cropping of rapeseed with wheat had the potential to increase soil C. However, the method has limitations for predicting soil C changes regarding crop management practices.

W.",Forest disturbance across the conterminous United States from 1985-2012: the emerging dominance of forest decline.,Forest Ecology and Management,"Evidence of shifting dominance among major forest disturbance agent classes regionally to globally has been emerging in the literature. For example, climate-related stress and secondary stressors on forests (e.g., insect and disease, fire) have dramatically increased since the turn of the century globally, while harvest rates in the western US and elsewhere have declined. For shifts to be quantified, accurate historical forest disturbance estimates are required as a baseline for examining current trends. We report annual disturbance rates (with uncertainties) in the aggregate and by major change causal agent class for the conterminous US and five geographic subregions between 1985 and 2012. Results are based on human interpretations of Landsat time series from a probability sample of 7200 plots (30 m) distributed throughout the study area. Forest disturbance information was recorded with a Landsat time series visualization and data collection tool that incorporates ancillary high-resolution data. National rates of disturbance varied between 1.5% and 4.5% of forest area per year, with trends being strongly affected by shifting dominance among specific disturbance agent influences at the regional scale. Throughout the time series, national harvest disturbance rates varied between one and two percent, and were largely a function of harvest in the more heavily forested regions of the US (Mountain West, Northeast, and Southeast). During the first part of the time series, national disturbance rates largely reflected trends in harvest disturbance. Beginning in the mid-90s, forest decline-related disturbances associated with diminishing forest health (e.g., physiological stress leading to tree canopy cover loss, increases in tree mortality above background levels), especially in the Mountain West and Lowland West regions of the US, increased dramatically. Consequently, national disturbance rates greatly increased by 2000, and remained high for much of the decade. Decline-related disturbance rates reached as high as 8% per year in the western regions during the early-2000s. Although low compared to harvest and decline, fire disturbance rates also increased in the early- to mid-2000s. We segmented annual decline-related disturbance rates to distinguish between newly impacted areas and areas undergoing gradual but consistent decline over multiple years. We also translated Landsat reflectance change into tree canopy cover change information for greater relevance to ecosystem modelers and forest managers, who can derive better understanding of forest-climate interactions and better adapt management strategies to changing climate regimes.

These forests include novel populations of the principal host species, lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), the novel species jack pine (Pinus banksiana), and their hybrids (P. contorta x P. banksiana). These novel forests are chemically and physically different than native forests, and recent studies have shown beetle reproductive performance is enhanced in these novel habitats. We conducted a field experiment to determine the effect of differing host chemistry, specifically alpha-pinene content, on secondary attraction by foraging mountain pine beetles. Alpha-pinene is the precursor molecule for the production of trans-verbenol, the main aggregation pheromone for this beetle species. We found that elevated relative concentrations of a-pinene in bolts significantly increased their attractiveness to in situ mountain pine beetles. Seventy-five percent of attacks were found on infested bolts with the most a-pinene relative to other monoterpenes. Other measures of terpene chemistry between bolt types could not explain the pattern of attacks. This result suggests that elevated concentrations of a-pinene could increase the rate of aggregation and attack success by the mountain pine beetle in novel pine forests. Newly invaded hybrid and jack pine in the western boreal forest are reported to contain 3-4 times the relative concentration of a-pinene than lodgepole pines in forests in which the beetle has coevolved. These elevated concentrations may help the mountain pine beetle overcome some of the potential restraints for establishment and spread in the boreal forest, such as low pine volume and connectivity, and continue expanding its range.

For example, range shifts may be slow if seed availability is low at range edges due to low parent-tree abundance or reduced fecundity. Even when seeds are available, climatic and biotic factors may further limit the availability of suitable microsites for recruitment. Unfortunately, the importance of seed and microsite limitation during range shifts remains unknown, since few studies have examined both factors simultaneously, particularly across species' ranges. To address this issue, we assessed seed availability and the factors influencing germination for six conifer species across a large environmental gradient encompassing their elevational ranges. Specifically, we assessed (1) how parent-tree abundance influences annual seed availability; (2) how seed limitation varies across species' ranges; (3) how climatic and biotic factors affect germination; and (4) how seed and suitable microsite availability covary annually within and among species. We found that seed availability declined toward species' upper range edges for most species, primarily due to low parent-tree abundance rather than declining fecundity. Range expansions are thus likely to be lagged with respect to climate change, as long generation times preclude rapid increases in tree density. Negative impacts of canopy cover on germination rates suggest range shifts will further be slowed by competition with existing vegetation. Moreover, years of high seed production were generally correlated among species, but not correlated with the availability of suitable microsites, implying that seedling competition and the interaction between seed and microsite limitation will further constrain recruitment. However, the nature of microsite limitation varied strongly between treeline and low-elevation species due to differing responses to snowpack duration and competition, suggesting that treeline species may be quicker to shift their ranges in response to warming than low-elevation species. In all, our results demonstrate that seed and microsite limitation will likely result in lagged responses to climate change but with differences among species leading to complex range shift dynamics.",2015,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Article,"climate change; conifers; elevation gradient; establishment; masting; microclimate; Mount Rainier National Park, Washington, USA; range shifts; regeneration niche; seedlings; species distributions",web_of_science,Yes,,,,,,

In forested montane regions, microclimate is thought to be influenced by combined effects of elevation, microtopography, and vegetation, but their relative effects at fine spatial scales are poorly known. We used boosted regression trees to model the spatial distribution of fine-scale, under-canopy air temperatures in mountainous terrain. Spatial models predicted observed independent test data well (r = 0.87). As expected, elevation strongly predicted temperatures, but vegetation and microtopography also exerted critical effects. Old-growth vegetation characteristics, measured using LiDAR (light detection and ranging), appeared to have an insulating effect; maximum spring monthly temperatures decreased by 2.5 degrees C across the observed gradient in old-growth structure. These cooling effects across a gradient in forest structure are of similar magnitude to 50-year forecasts of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and therefore have the potential to mitigate climate warming at local scales. Management strategies to conserve old-growth characteristics and to curb current rates of primary forest loss could maintain microrefugia, enhancing biodiversity persistence in mountainous systems under climate warming.",2016,Science & Technology - Other Topics,Article,NA,web_of_science,Yes,,,,,,

Brion; Reeves, Gordon H.",Restoring fire-prone Inland Pacific landscapes: seven core principles,LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY,"Context More than a century of forest and fire management of Inland Pacific landscapes has transformed their successional and disturbance dynamics. Regional connectivity of many terrestrial and aquatic habitats is fragmented, flows of some ecological and physical processes have been altered in space and time, and the frequency, size and intensity of many disturbances that configure these habitats have been altered. Current efforts to address these impacts yield a small footprint in comparison to wildfires and insect outbreaks. Moreover, many current projects emphasize thinning and fuels reduction within individual forest stands, while overlooking large-scale habitat connectivity and disturbance flow issues. Methods We provide a framework for landscape restoration, offering seven principles. We discuss their implication for management, and illustrate their application with examples. Results Historical forests were spatially heterogeneous at multiple scales. Heterogeneity was the result of variability and interactions among native ecological patterns and processes, including successional and disturbance processes regulated by climatic and topographic drivers. Native flora and fauna were adapted to these conditions, which conferred a measure of resilience to variability in climate and recurrent contagious disturbances. Conclusions To restore key characteristics of this resilience to current landscapes, planning and management are needed at ecoregion, local landscape, successional patch, and tree neighborhood scales. Restoration that works effectively across ownerships and allocations will require active thinking about landscapes as socio-ecological systems that provide services to people within the finite capacities of ecosystems. We focus attention on landscape-level prescriptions as foundational to restoration planning and execution.",NA,NA,Review,Forest and rangeland restoration; Hierarchical organization; Large fires; Patch size distributions; Successional patches; Topographic controls,web_of_science,Yes,,,,,,

Two separate validation approaches indicate this dataset provides a more accurate representation of glacial ice and perennial snow cover for the region than either the U.S. glacier database derived from US Geological Survey (USGS) Digital Raster Graphics (DRG) maps (based on aerial photography primarily from the 1960s-1980s) or the National Land Cover Database 2011 perennial ice and snow cover class. Our 2010-2014 Landsat-derived dataset indicates 28% less glacier and perennial snow cover than the USGS DRG dataset. There are larger differences between the datasets in some regions, such as the Rocky Mountains of Northwest Wyoming and Southwest Montana, where the Landsat dataset indicates 54% less PISC area. Analysis of Landsat scenes from 1987-1988 and 2008-2010 for three regions using a more conventional, semi-automated approach indicates substantial decreases in glaciers and perennial snow cover that correlate with differences between PISC mapped by the USGS DRG dataset and the automated Landsat-derived dataset. This suggests that most of the differences in PISC between the USGS DRG and the Landsat-derived dataset can be attributed to decreases in PISC, as opposed to differences between mapping techniques. While the dataset produced by the automated Landsat mapping approach is not designed to serve as a conventional glacier inventory that provides glacier outlines and attribute information, it allows for an updated estimate of PISC for the conterminous U.S. as well as for smaller regions. Additionally, the new dataset highlights areas where decreases in PISC have been most significant over the past 25-50 years.

We monitored stream temperatures between August 2008 and August 2009 at 41 sites ranging from small headwater streams to larger valley bottom streams. At a subset of these sites (n = 27), we collected tailed frog abundance and biomass estimates. Two temperature metrics, maximum weekly average temperature (MWAT) and accumulated degree days > 5 degrees C (DD 5), a measure of physiological time, were related to tailed frog occurrence and abundance. Larval occurrence was found to be limited when DD 5 was = 160 degrees C and MWAT = 8 degrees C. No breeding streams were too warm to support tailed frogs. Frogs and tadpoles had similar realized niche centres for both MWAT (about 10.8 degrees C) and DD 5 (about 355 degrees C). However, frogs had greater realized niche widths than tadpoles. The temperature metrics were only weakly related to catchment-scale variables (area, mean elevation, ruggedness, aspect, site elevation), such that catchment scale variables cannot be used to make reliable predictions of thermal habitat suitability.

In this regards, a comprehensive overview of the ecosystem functions and socioeconomic factors that have been impacted by the current outbreaks in western Canada was carried out to facilitate a more general ES assessment. In addition to timber production, current MPB outbreaks have negative effects on provisioning services (water supply and food production) and aesthetic cultural services, while effects on regulating services (carbon and forest fire) are still in debate.

Although high-latitude regions are expected to experience some of the greatest increases in temperature due to global warming, little is known on how individual responses in species will affect patterns in phylogenetic diversity (PD). Location Alberta, Canada. Method sWe used 160,589 occurrence records for 1541 species of seed plants in Alberta (nearly 90% of the province's seed flora) and ensemble niche models to project current and future suitable habitats. We then examined climate change vulnerability of individual species and the potential impacts of climate change on species richness, PD and both taxonomic and phylogenetic endemism (PE). We also assessed whether predicted losses of PD were distributed randomly across the plant tree of life. Results We found that 368 species (24%) may lose on average >80% of their current suitable climates (habitats), while 539 species (35%) were projected to more than double their current suitable range. Both species richness and PD were predicted to increase in most areas, except for the species-rich Rocky Mountains, which are predicted to experience future declines. Maps of taxonomic and PE identified several regions with high conservation value and climate change threat suggesting priorities for conservation and climate change adaptation. Overall, a non-random extinction risk was found for Alberta's flora, demonstrating potential future impacts of climate change on the loss of evolutionary history. Main conclusions Our analyses suggest that climate change will have asymmetrical effects on the distribution of Alberta's plant diversity and endemism and a non-random extinction risk of the current state of species evolutionary history.

The purpose of this study is to quantify historical tree spatial patterns and assess recent mortality trends for old and large tree populations in dry mixed-conifer forests of the Northern Rocky Mountains. We analyzed historical reconstructions of forest spatial structure across six 1.0 ha plots located in mixed ponderosa pine/Douglas-fir stands in western Montana, USA. Across plots, 10-23% of trees occurred as widely spaced individuals (no neighbors within 6 m), with the remaining 77-90% of trees occurring in clumps (groups of two or more trees spaced less than 6 m apart). Mean clump size was 2.2-4.2 trees per clump, although large clumps (>10 trees) were common. Global spatial analysis with the pair correlation function indicated that ponderosa pine patterns were spatially random at all scales, while Douglas-fir trees were spatially aggregated at scales less than 6 m. The proportion of plot area farther than 9 m from the nearest tree ranged from 1% to 20% across the six study plots. Mortality rates between 1991 and 2012 averaged 0.8% yr(-1) for old ponderosa pine and 2.1% yr(-1) for old Douglas-fir. We found limited evidence of density-dependent mortality for both species pooled and for ponderosa pine individually. Douglas-fir that died between 1991 and 2012 had higher local Stand Density Index (SDI) of Douglas-fir neighbors than did Douglas-fir that survived (P = 0.003), indicating conspecific density-dependent mortality. When compared to ponderosa pine and dry mixed-conifer forests in other regions, trees were distributed much more evenly across clump sizes in our Montana study sites. Our analysis provides an estimate of the historical range of variability for spatial aspects of forest structure in dry mixed-conifer forests of the northern US Rockies and is relevant to the design of restoration and climate change adaptation treatments in such forests.

Because of their connection to nearby uplands, riparian vegetation communities at these streams respond to many environmental filtersclimatic, physical, chemical or biotic factorsthat restrict what species can occur at a given location from within larger regional species pools. In this study, we examined how environmental filters originating at the landscape, watershed and reach scales correspond to riparian plant community composition across the interior Columbia and upper Missouri River basins, USA. We correlated riparian vegetation to environmental filters, identified unique communities and partitioned the variance within riparian vegetation data among filters originating at different scales. Riparian vegetation composition was strongly correlated to landscape-scale filters including elevation, precipitation and temperature. Watershed-scale filters such as grazing and reach filters indicative of fluvial setting were also correlated to vegetation composition, often differentiating communities with similar landscape settings. We identified 10 distinct vegetation communities. Forested communities occurred at higher elevation, moderate gradient reaches with high mean annual precipitation. Shrub-forb systems corresponded to fluvial and watershed disturbances and occurred within climates that could preclude forest establishment. Meadows corresponded to high water tables and/or high grazing activity. Variance partitioning showed that landscape-scale filters explained the most variance within vegetation communities. Global change will alter many of the environmental filters that drive vegetation. Vegetation change may occur rapidly if local filters (e.g. fluvial process) change rapidly or may occur more slowly if larger-order filters (e.g. climate) change slowly and without influencing local hydrogeomorphic filters. By identifying filter-vegetation relationships at large spatial scales, hypotheses can be constructed on how riparian vegetation communities may change under future environmental conditions.

Andrews Experimental Forest in western Oregon, using statistical analyses (regression, ANOVA, and wavelet coherence) of hourly snowmelt lysimeter, air and dewpoint temperature, wind speed, precipitation, and discharge data. All events involved snowpack outflow, but only seven events had continuous net snowpack outflow, including three of the five top-ranked peak discharge events. Peak discharge was not related to precipitation rate, but it was related to the 10 day sum of precipitation and net snowpack outflow, indicating an increased flood response to continuously melting snowpacks. The two largest peak discharge events in the study had significant wavelet coherence at multiple time scales over several days; a distribution of phase differences between precipitation and net snowpack outflow at the 12-32 h time scale with a sharp peak at /2 radians; and strongly correlated snowpack outflow among lysimeters representing 42% of basin area. The recipe for an extreme rain-on-snow event includes persistent, slow melt within the snowpack, which appears to produce a near-saturated zone within the snowpack throughout the landscape, such that the snowpack may transmit pressure waves of precipitation directly to streams, and this process is synchronized across the landscape.

In addition, the effects of climate changes on ecosystem structure and function are often modulated or delayed, meaning that short-term experiments are not sufficient to characterize ecosystem responses. This study capitalized on a long-term reciprocal soil transplant experiment to examine the response of dryland soils to climate change. The two transplant sites were separated by 500 m of elevation on the same mountain slope in eastern Washington state, USA, and had similar plant species and soil types. We resampled the original 1994 soil transplants and controls, measuring CO2 production, temperature response, enzyme activity, and bacterial community structure after 17 years. Over a laboratory incubation of 100 days, reciprocally transplanted soils respired roughly equal cumulative amounts of carbon as non-transplanted controls from the same site. Soils transplanted from the hot, dry, lower site to the cooler and wetter (difference of -5 degrees C monthly maximum air temperature, +50 mm yr(-1) precipitation) upper site exhibited almost no respiratory response to temperature (Q(10) of 1.1), but soils originally from the upper, cooler site had generally higher respiration rates. The bacterial community structure of transplants did not differ significantly from that of untransplanted controls, however. Slight differences in local climate between the upper and lower Rattlesnake locations, simulated with environmental control chambers during the incubation, thus prompted significant differences in microbial activity, with no observed change to bacterial structure. These results support the idea that environmental shifts can influence soil C through metabolic changes, and suggest that microbial populations responsible for soil heterotrophic respiration may be constrained in surprising ways, even as shorter-and longer-term soil microbial dynamics may be significantly different under changing climate.",2016,Science & Technology - Other Topics,Article,NA,web_of_science,Yes,,,,,,

We analyse 30 years of occurrence records to investigate whether a trend exists, and assess its strength. A Bayesian hierarchical model is used to estimate occurrence rate trends across six geographical zones in western Canada. The results suggest that natural avalanche occurrence rates have decreased or stayed constant; however, there is a very high level of uncertainty. This uncertainty will need to be factored into decision-making processes.

Research is needed to understand which forcings (after temperature and precipitation) would most benefit snow modeling through expanded observation or improved estimation techniques. Here, the impact of forcing data availability on snow model output is assessed with data-withholding experiments using 3-yr datasets at well-instrumented sites in four climates. The interplay between forcing availability and model complexity is examined among the Utah Energy Balance (UEB), the Distributed Hydrology Soil Vegetation Model (DHSVM) snow submodel, and the snow thermal model (SNTHERM). Sixty-four unique forcing scenarios were evaluated, with different assumptions regarding availability of hourly meteorological observations at each site. Modeled snow water equivalent (SWE) and snow surface temperature T-surf diverged most often because of availability of longwave radiation, which is the least frequently measured forcing in cold regions in the western United States. Availability of longwave radiation (i.e., observed vs empirically estimated) caused maximum SWE differences up to 234 mm (57% of peak SWE), mean differences up to 6.2 degrees C in T-surf, and up to 32 days difference in snow disappearance timing.

Although bark beetles are indigenous to North American forests, climate change has facilitated the beetle's expansion into previously unsuitable habitats. We used three correlative niche models (maximum entropy [MaxEnt], boosted regression trees, and generalized linear models) to estimate (1) the current potential distribution of the beetle in the U.S. Rocky Mountain region, (2) how this distribution has changed since historical outbreaks in the 1960s and 1970s, and (3) how the distribution may be expected to change under future climate scenarios. Additionally, we evaluated the temporal transferability of the niche models by forecasting historical models and testing the model predictions using temporally independent outbreak data from the current outbreak. Our results indicated that there has been a significant expansion of climatically suitable habitat over the past 50 yr and that much of this expansion corresponds with an upward shift in elevation across the study area. Furthermore, our models indicated that drought was a more prominent driver of current outbreak than temperature, which suggests a change in the climatic signature between historical and current outbreaks. Projections under future conditions suggest that there will be a large reduction in climatically suitable habitat for the beetle and that high-elevation forests will continue to become more susceptible to outbreak. While all three models generated reasonable predictions, the generalized linear model correctly predicted a higher percentage of current outbreak localities when trained on historical data.

Using a mechanistic, phenology-based demographic model driven by downscaled daily temperature data, we describe recent and future spatial and temporal thermal suitability for mountain pine beetle population growth in a topographically complex region. Trends in model-predicted growth rates among Global Climate Models were similar and suggest that, relative to future trends, mountain pine beetle population growth within the past 60 years was most optimal at middle elevations and Least optimal at the Lowest and highest elevations. This trend aligns with observed mountain pine beetle-caused tree mortality that was greatest at middle elevations between 1997 and 2013, as estimated from Aerial Detection Surveys. However, thermal suitability for optimal phenological synchrony was predicted to shift in recent years, and by the end of the century, the best thermal habitats for mountain pine beetle will be at the Lowest and highest elevations.

Floods also strongly influence the structure and function of watersheds, stream channels, and aquatic ecosystems. The Pacific Northwest is particularly vulnerable to climatically driven changes in flood frequency and magnitude, because snowpacks that strongly influence flood generation are near the freezing point and thus sensitive to small changes in temperature. To improve predictions of future flooding potential and inform strategies to adapt to these changes, we mapped the sensitivity of landscapes to changes in peak flows due to climate warming across Oregon and Washington. We first developed principal component- based models for predicting peak flows across a range of recurrence intervals (2-, 10-, 25-, 50-, and 100- years) based on historical instantaneous peak flow data from 1000 gauged watersheds in Oregon and Washington. Key predictors of peak flows included drainage area and principal component scores for climate, land cover, soil, and topographic metrics. We then used these regression models to predict future peak flows by perturbing the climate variables based on future climate projections (2020s, 2040s, and 2080s) for the A1B emission scenario. For each recurrence interval, peak flow sensitivities were computed as the ratio of future to current peak flow magnitudes. Our analysis suggests that temperature- induced changes in snowpack dynamics will result in large (>30-40%) increases in peak flow magnitude in some areas, principally the Cascades, Olympics, and Blue Mountains and parts of the western edge of the Rocky Mountains. Flood generation processes in lower elevation areas are less likely to be affected, but some of these areas may be impacted by floodwaters from upstream. These results can assist land, water, and infrastructure managers in identifying watersheds and resources that are particularly vulnerable to increased peak flows and developing plans to increase their resilience.

The negative correlation between S and temperature weakens linearly with elevation, whereas the correlation between S and precipitation increases asymptotically with elevation. The curvilinear relationship in the latter case was not visible in prior studies because of the observation networks' limited range. In our historical validation, there is a range of threshold elevations (1580-2181 m) across six mountainous regions, above which precipitation is the main driver of snowpack variability and below which temperature is the main driver. Under a moderate end-of-century climate change scenario, these thresholds increase by 191 to 432 m.

K.; Hadley, Adam S.; Betts, Matthew G.",Microclimate predicts within-season distribution dynamics of montane forest birds,DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS,"Aim Climate changes are anticipated to have pervasive negative effects on biodiversity and are expected to necessitate widespread range shifts or contractions. Such projections are based upon the assumptions that (1) species respond primarily to broad-scale climatic regimes, or (2) that variation in climate at fine spatial scales is less relevant at coarse spatial scales. However, in montane forest landscapes, high degrees of microclimate variability could influence occupancy dynamics and distributions of forest species. Using high-resolution bird survey and under-canopy air temperature data, we tested the hypothesis that the high vagility of most forest bird species combined with the heterogeneous thermal regime of mountain landscapes would enable them to adjust initial settlement decisions to track their thermal niches. Location Western Cascade Mountains, Oregon, USA. Methods We used dynamic occupancy models to test the degree to which microclimate affects the distribution patterns of forest birds in a heterogeneous mountain environment. In all models we statistically accounted for vegetation structure, vegetation composition and potential biases due to imperfect detection of birds. We generated spatial predictions of forest bird distributions in relation to microclimate and vegetation structure. Results Fine-scale temperature metrics were strong predictors of bird distributions; effects of temperature on within-season occupancy dynamics were as large or larger (1-1.7 times) than vegetation effects. Most species (86.7%) exhibited apparent within-season occupancy dynamics. However, species were almost as likely to be warm associated (i. e., apparent settlement at warmer sites and/or vacancy at cooler sites; 53.3% of species) as cool associated (i. e., apparent settlement at cooler sites and/or vacancy at warmer sites; 46.7% of species), suggesting that microclimate preferences are species specific. Main conclusions High-resolution temperature data increase the quality of predictions about avian distribution dynamics and should be included in efforts to project future distributions. We hypothesize that microclimate-associated distribution patterns may reflect species' potential for behavioural buffering from climate change in montane forest environments.",2016,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Article,dynamic occupancy models; forest bird distributions; forest structure and; composition; microclimate; mountains; within-season movements,web_of_science,Yes,,,,,,

Understanding the drivers of aspects of performance, such as growth, at distribution edges is thus crucial to accurately predicting responses of tree species to climate change. Here, we use a Bayesian model and sensitivity analysis to partition the effects of climate and crowding, as a metric of competition, on radial growth of three dominant conifer species along montane ecotones in the Rocky Mountains. These ecotones represent upper and lower distribution edges of two species, and span the distribution interior of the third species. Our results indicate a greater influence of climate (i.e., temperature and precipitation) than crowding on radial growth. Competition importance appears to increase towards regions of more favorable growing conditions, and precise responses to crowding and climate vary across species.

In western North America, recent widespread insect outbreaks and wildfires have sparked acute concerns about potential insect-fire interactions. Although previous research shows that insect activity typically does not increase wildfire likelihood, key uncertainties remain regarding insect effects on wildfire severity (i.e., ecological impact). Recent assessments indicate that outbreak severity and burn severity are not strongly associated, but these studies have been limited to specific insect or fire events. Here, we present a regional census of large wildfire severity following outbreaks of two prevalent bark beetle and defoliator species, mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) and western spruce budworm (Choristoneura freemani), across the US Pacific Northwest. Wefirst quantify insect effects on burn severity with spatial modeling at the fire event scale and then evaluate how these effects vary across the full population of insect-fire events (n = 81 spanning 1987-2011). In contrast to common assumptions of positive feedbacks, we find that insects generally reduce the severity of subsequent wildfires. Specific effects vary with insect type and timing, but both insects decrease the abundance of live vegetation susceptible to wildfire at multiple time lags. By dampening subsequent burn severity, native insects could buffer rather than exacerbate fire regime changes expected due to land use and climate change. In light of these findings, we recommend a precautionary approach when designing and implementing forest management policies intended to reduce wildfire hazard and increase resilience to global change.",2016,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Article,bark beetle; defoliator; disturbance interactions; fire ecology; forest health; regime change; remote sensing,web_of_science,Yes,,,,,,

The global studies lack the specificity to inform decision making, while the local studies do little to clarify potential changes over large regions (major river basins, states, or groups of states), a scale often important in the development of water policy. An analysis of the potential impact of climate change on groundwater recharge across the western United States (west of 100 longitude) is presented synthesizing existing studies and applying current knowledge of recharge processes and amounts. Eight representative aquifers located across the region were evaluated. For each aquifer published recharge budget components were converted into four standard recharge mechanisms: diffuse, focused, irrigation, and mountain-systems recharge. Future changes in individual recharge mechanisms and total recharge were then estimated for each aquifer. Model-based studies of projected climate-change effects on recharge were available and utilized for half of the aquifers. For the remainder, forecasted changes in temperature and precipitation were logically propagated through each recharge mechanism producing qualitative estimates of direction of changes in recharge only (not magnitude). Several key patterns emerge from the analysis. First, the available estimates indicate average declines of 10-20% in total recharge across the southern aquifers, but with a wide range of uncertainty that includes no change. Second, the northern set of aquifers will likely incur little change to slight increases in total recharge. Third, mountain system recharge is expected to decline across much of the region due to decreased snow pack, with that impact lessening with higher elevation and latitude. Factors contributing the greatest uncertainty in the estimates include: (1) limited studies quantitatively coupling climate projections to recharge estimation methods using detailed, process-based numerical models; (2) a generally poor understanding of hydrologic flowpaths and processes in mountain systems; (3) difficulty predicting the response of focused recharge to potential changes in the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events; and (4) unconstrained feedbacks between climate, irrigation practices, and recharge in highly developed aquifer systems.

Improved prediction tools that provide high resolution spatial information are necessary for location-specific soil conservation and watershed management. However, quantifying the magnitude of soil erosion and its interactions with climate, hydrological processes, and fire occurrences across a large region (>10,000 km(2)) is challenging because of the large computational requirements needed to capture the fine-scale complexities of the land surface that govern erosion. We apply the physically-based coupled Variable Capacity Infiltration-Water Erosion Prediction Project (VIC-WEPP) model to study how wildfire occurrences can enhance soil erosion in a future climate over a representative watershed in the northern Rocky Mountains - the Salmon River Basin (SRB) in central Idaho. While the VIC model simulates hydrologic processes at larger scales, the WEPP model simulates erosion at the hillslope scale by sampling representative hillslopes. VIC-WEPP model results indicate that SRB streamflow will have an earlier shift in peak flow by one to two months under future climate scenarios in response to a declining snowpack under warming temperatures. The magnitude of peak flow increases with each higher severity fire scenario; and under the highest fire severity, the peak flow is shifted even earlier, exacerbating the effects of climate change. Similarly, sediment yield also increases with higher fire severities for both historical and future climates. Sediment yield is more sensitive to fire occurrence than to climate change by one to two orders of magnitude, which is not unexpected given that our fire scenarios were applied basin wide as worst case scenarios. In reality, fires only occur over portions of the basin in any given year and subsequent years' vegetation regrowth reduces erosion. However, the effects of climate change on sediment yield result in greater spatial heterogeneities, primarily because of the spatial differences in precipitation projections, while fire conditions were uniformly applied. The combined effects of climate change and a possible continuation of increasing fire frequency and severity will compound excess sediment issues that already exist in this region of the intermountain West.

Our hypothesis was not borne out by the observations except in the case of peak SWE; other snow metrics did not resemble predicted values based on modeled sensitivities and thus are not effective analogs of future temperature sensitivities.

Increasing a region's food self-reliance is a strategy to address this concern, but is a challenge in regions with limited arable lands as a result of topographically diverse, mountain-dominated landscapes. Mechanized, large-scale agriculture relies on contiguous areas of arable land, rather than small parcels of dispersed arable soils and suitable climates. The Kootenay region of British Columbia, Canada, serves as an example of the opportunities for mountainous, rural communities to increase their food self-sufficiency by considering the potential for agriculture on small parcels of land. Soil capability survey maps that provide a biophysical assessment of arable lands were used as a basis for determining (a) the potential land base available for small-scale agriculture, and (b) the potential for niche crops that may be grown on poorer capability lands in the Kootenay region. The soil capability criteria, coupled with farm survey data, were used to measure and quantify the distribution of underutilized farmland in the region. Results indicate that up to 90 percent of land capable of agriculture and 69 percent of high quality farm land protected under the Agricultural Land Reserve is not under production for crops or pasture. Global Climate Model scenarios for 2050 indicate that the region will have a longer growing season, hotter summers, and more frost-free days, which could increase the region's capacity to grow food but might require additional water for irrigation.

Whitebark pine is a keystone species providing a variety of values including watershed protection and food and habitat for wildlife. An increasingly used method of protecting pines from mountain pine beetles involves the antiaggregation pheromone verbenone, but no studies have evaluated the ability of verbenone applied annually to protect whitebark pines throughout mountain pine beetle outbreaks. We applied verbenone pouches annually for 7 years until an outbreak ended. Probabilities that whitebark pines survived through the end of the outbreak were 0.34 +/- 0.15 for control trees and 0.68 +/- 0.17 for trees treated with verbenone once per year. Evidence from a second verbenone treatment that was discontinued before the end of the outbreak suggested that applying verbenone twice, as opposed to once, per year may more effectively protect trees. Increased survival did not appear to vary with tree size (i.e., dbh).

These outbreaks reduce plant productivity by killing trees and transfer carbon from live to dead pools where carbon is slowly emitted to the atmosphere via heterotrophic respiration which subsequently feeds back to climate change. Recent studies have begun to examine the local impacts of bark beetle outbreaks in individual stands, but the full regional carbon consequences remain undocumented for the western US. In this study, we quantify the regional carbon impacts of the bark beetle outbreaks taking place in western US forests. The work relies on a combination of postdisturbance forest regrowth trajectories derived from forest inventory data and a process-based carbon cycle model tracking decomposition, as well as aerial detection survey (ADS) data documenting the regional extent and severity of recent outbreaks. We find that biomass killed by bark beetle attacks across beetle-affected areas in western US forests from 2000 to 2009 ranges from 5 to 15TgCyr(-1) and caused a reduction of net ecosystem productivity (NEP) of about 6.1-9.3TgCy(-1) by 2009. Uncertainties result largely from a lack of detailed surveys of the extent and severity of outbreaks, calling out a need for improved characterization across western US forests.

Because cattle (Bos taurus) grazing can impact the abundance, distribution, and ecological function of native plant and animal communities, it is important to understand how cattle might respond to increasingly arid conditions. Here, we evaluate changes in habitat selection by cattle across an 8-yr period as a function of rainfall and other environmental covariates. Using resource selection functions, we evaluated habitat selection based on 2 behaviors, stationary and mobile. Models revealed similarity in cattle habitat selection across years, with only modest changes in selection as a function of precipitation, despite marked seasonal and interannual differences in rainfall. Cattle preferred gentle slopes, forest edges, wet meadows, and areas near water as well as areas far from water on plateaus. Cattle avoided areas at intermediate distances from water, typically associated with steep slopes. As conditions became drier during the late season, cattle did not switch selection patterns but instead contracted their selection around water. Cattle also selected similar habitats whether they were mobile or stationary, possibly making microsite decisions therein. This consistent pattern of selection across years could be particularly problematic for riparian communities as climates become drier; however, it may also simplify cattle management, as range managers can focus vegetation monitoring efforts on riparian areas. Due to the uncertainty surrounding future climatic conditions, it is imperative that both range and wildlife managers develop long-term plans to continue managing these multiuse landscapes in an ecologically sustainable manner based on expected patterns of livestock grazing.",2015,Agriculture,Article; Proceedings Paper,biodiversity; Bos taurus; cattle; climate change; impacts; public land,web_of_science,Yes,,,,,,

This study uses a stochastic conceptual snowmelt-runoff model to generate inflow ensembles for a wide range of potential temperature and precipitation scenarios as a means of testing which types of climate changes could adversely affect hydropower production. The method is applied to a case study of the Dworshak Reservoir on the North Fork of the Clearwater River in central Idaho. Reservoir operations in response to the climate-change ensemble scenarios were simulated using a decision support system operations model according to current operating criteria and guidelines. The magnitude and timing of hydropower generation resulting from each temperature- and precipitation-change scenario were examined, assuming no change from historical reservoir operations. Results showed that lower precipitation and higher temperature created less runoff and therefore less hydropower generation. However, increased precipitation and decreased temperature scenarios showed limited increases in hydropower production due to turbine capacity and other operational constraints. Firm hydropower production from Dworshak steadily decreased with increasing mean annual temperature and steadily increased with increasing mean annual precipitation. Timing of spring hydropower production shifted to earlier spring and winter with increasing temperature. Because these simulations did not adapt reservoir operations from historical procedures, they are not intended to be realistic predictions of changes in hydropower generation in the future.

However, current species distribution models rely on coarse scale climate data, whereas fine scale microclimate data may be necessary to assess habitat suitability and generate predictive models. Here, we evaluate disparities between temperature data at the coarse scale from weather stations versus fine-scale data measured in microhabitats required for a climate-sensitive mammal, the American pika (Ochotona princeps). We collected two years of temperature data in occupied talus habitats predicted to be suitable (high elevation) and unsuitable (low elevation) by the bioclimatic envelope approach. At low elevations, talus surface and interstitial microclimates drastically differed from ambient temperatures measured on-site and at a nearby weather station. Interstitial talus temperatures were frequently decoupled from high ambient temperatures, resulting in instantaneous disparities of over 30 degrees C between these two measurements. Microhabitat temperatures were also highly heterogeneous, such that temperature measurements within the same patch of talus were not more correlated than measurements at distant patches. An experimental manipulation revealed that vegetation cover may cool the talus surface by up to 10 degrees C during the summer, which may contribute to this spatial heterogeneity. Finally, low elevation microclimates were milder and less variable than typical alpine habitat, suggesting that, counter to species distribution model predictions, these seemingly unsuitable habitats may actually be better refugia for this species under climate change.

The loss of mature host trees results in reductions of ecosystem carbon productivity.

Infestations may result in system carbon storage reductions, relative to storage among undisturbed developmental trajectories, mostly because of the temporary decrease in carbon productivity. Carbon losses in infested stands are slow as a result of recalcitrance of snags and coarse woody debris.

Results indicate that air temperature increases associated with future climates could account for a much larger proportion of stream temperature increases (as much as 90 % at a basin scale) than wildfire. Similarly, land management scenarios that limited wildfire prevalence had negligible effects on future stream temperature increases. These patterns emerged at broader spatial scales because wildfires typically affected only a subset of a stream's network. However, at finer spatial and temporal scales stream temperatures were sensitive to wildfire.

Simulation results from the coupled ECHAM5-MPI-OM model with A1B emission scenario were first dynamically downscaled to 12 km resolution with the WRF model. Then a quantile-mapping-based statistical downscaling model was used to downscale them into 1/16 degrees resolution daily climate data over historical and future periods. Two climate data series were generated, with bias correction (BC) and without bias correction (NBC). Impact models were then applied to estimate hydrologic and biogeochemical responses to both BC and NBC meteorological data sets. These impact models include a macroscale hydrologic model (VIC), a coupled cropping system model (VIC-CropSyst), an ecohydrological model (RHESSys), a biogenic emissions model (MEGAN), and a nutrient export model (Global-NEWS). Results demonstrate that the BC and NBC climate data provide consistent estimates of the climate-driven changes in water fluxes (ET, runoff, and water demand), VOCs (isoprene and monoterpenes) and NO emissions, mean crop yield, and river DIN export over the PNW domain. However, significant differences rise from projected SWE, crop yield from dry lands, and HJ-Andrews's ET between BC and NBC data. Even though BC post-processing has no significant impacts on most of the studied variables when taking PNW as a whole, their effects have large spatial variations and some local areas are substantially influenced. In addition, there are months during which BC and NBC post-processing produces significant differences in projected changes, such as summer runoff. Factor-controlled simulations indicate that BC post-processing of precipitation and temperature both substantially contribute to these differences at regional scales. We conclude that there are trade-offs between using BC climate data for offline CCI studies versus directly modeled climate data. These trade-offs should be considered when designing integrated modeling frameworks for specific applications; for example, BC may be more important when considering impacts on reservoir operations in mountainous watersheds than when investigating impacts on biogenic emissions and air quality, for which VOCs are a primary indicator.",2014,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology,Article,NA,web_of_science,Yes,,,,,,

The study has constructed a state-of-the-art, end-to-end data processing sequence from ""raw"" climate model output to a suite of hydrologic modelling products that are served to the user community from a web-accessible database. A calibrated 1/16 degree latitude-longitude resolution implementation of the VIC hydrologic model over the Columbia River basin was used to produce historical simulations and 77 future hydrologic projections associated with three different statistical downscaling methods and three future time periods (2020s, 2040s, and 2080s). Key products from the study include summary data for about 300 river locations in the PNW and monthly Geographic Information System products for 21 hydrologic variables over the entire study domain. Results from the study show profound changes in spring snowpack and fundamental shifts from snow and mixed-rain-and-snow to rain-dominant behaviour across most of the domain. Associated shifts in streamflow timing from spring and summer to winter are also evident in basins with significant snow accumulation in winter (for the current climate). Potential evapotranspiration increases over most of the PNW in summer because of rising temperatures; however, actual evapotranspiration is reduced in all but a few areas of the domain because evapotranspiration is mostly water limited in summer, and summer precipitation decreases in the simulations. Simulated widespread increases in soil moisture recharge in fall and winter in areas with significant snow accumulation in winter (for the current climate) support hypotheses of increased landslide risk and sediment transport in winter in the future. Simulations of floods and extreme low flows increase in intensity for most of the river sites included in the study. The largest increases in flooding are in mixed-rain-and-snow basins whose current mid-winter temperatures are within a few degrees of freezing.

Although forest managers rely heavily on the use of silvicultural treatments that manipulate stand structure and stand dynamics to modify responses to climate change, few studies have directly assessed the effects of stand structure or canopy position on climate-growth relationships - or examined how this relationship may vary among species or across environmental gradients. In this study, we analyzed variability in tree-ring series from 15 low-elevation stands in northeastern Washington (USA) using time series analysis and linear mixed effects models. Our objective was to assess the relative influences of species (Pinus ponderosa vs. Pseudotsuga menziesii), crown class (dominant vs. intermediate), and habitat type (Xeric vs. Dry-Mesic) on the climate responses of mature trees in unmanaged forests. We found that climate-growth relationships varied significantly between canopy classes and across habitat types but that these effects were highly species-specific. For P. menziesii, growth responses to temperature and precipitation did not vary between canopy classes. For P. ponderosa, however, regression coefficients for the relationship between temperature and radial growth were nearly twice as large for dominant trees compared to intermediate trees, and 84% of dominant trees were significantly influenced by precipitation, compared to only 62% of intermediate trees. In contrast, habitat-type did not significantly affect the climate responses of P. ponderosa, but did affect responses of P. menziesii. For example, for P. menziesii only 51% of trees in Dry-Mesic sites, were significantly affected by drought (PDSI), compared to 93% in Xeric sites. A better understanding of the relationship between climate sensitivity, species-specific hydraulic strategies, and stand dynamics is crucial for accurately predicting tree responses to climate change and designing forest treatments that will effectively reduce the climatic vulnerability of key forest species and habitats. Results may assist managers with understanding how altering stand dynamics will differentially affect climate-responses of individual species.

Future projected changes in temperature are for annual increases of approximately +2 degrees C by the 2050s and +3 degrees C by the 2080s. The 2050s and 2080s precipitation projections are for increased winter precipitation in all basins and decreases in summertime precipitation for two of the three basins-with increases projected in the northeastern BC subwatershed.

The uncertainty results were variable across the three hydroclimate regimes. Coastal headwater systems in British Columbia experience more uncertainty associated with changes during winter and the summer, whereas interior systems experience the greatest uncertainties during the winter and spring.

To enhance our understanding of the influence climate and local topography have on glacier area, large numbers of glaciers of different sizes and attributes need to be monitored over periods of many decades. We used Interprovincial Boundary Commission Survey (IBCS) maps of the Alberta-British Columbia (BC) border (1903-1924), BC Terrain Resource Information Management (TRIM) data (1982-1987), and Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) imagery (2000-2002 and 2006) to document planimetric changes in glacier cover in the central and southern Canadian Rocky Mountains between 1919 and 2006. Over this period, glacier cover in the study area decreased by 590 +/- 70 km(2) (40 +/- 5 %), 17 of 523 glaciers disappeared and 124 glaciers fragmented into multiple ice masses. Glaciers smaller than 1.0 km(2) experienced the greatest relative area loss (64 +/- 8 %), and relative area loss is more variable with small glaciers, suggesting that the local topographic setting controls the response of these glaciers to climate change. Small glaciers with low slopes, low mean/median elevations, south to west aspects, and high insolation experienced the largest reduction in area. Similar rates of area change characterize the periods 1919-1985 and 1985-2001; -6.3 +/- 0.6 km(2) yr(-1) (-0.4 +/- 0.1% yr(-1)) and -5.0 +/- 0.5 km(2) yr(-1) (-0.5 +/- 0.1% yr(-1)), respectively.

Although various remote sensing approaches have been developed to monitor insect impacts, most studies have focused on single insect agents or single locations and have not related observed changes to ground-based measurements. This study presents a remote sensing framework to (1) characterize spectral trajectories associated with insect activity of varying duration and severity and (2) relate those trajectories to ground-based measurements of tree mortality and surface fuels in the Cascade Range, Oregon, USA. We leverage a Landsat time series change detection algorithm (LandTrendr), annual forest health aerial detection surveys (ADS), and field measurements to investigate two study landscapes broadly applicable to conifer forests and dominant insect agents of western North America. We distributed 38 plots across multiple forest types (ranging from mesic mixed-conifer to xeric lodgepole pine) and insect agents (defoliator [western spruce budworm] and bark beetle [mountain pine beetle]). Insect effects were evident in the Landsat time series as combinations of both short- and long-duration changes in the Normalized Burn Ratio spectral index. Western spruce budworm trajectories appeared to show a consistent temporal evolution of long-duration spectral decline (loss of vegetation) followed by recovery, whereas mountain pine beetle plots exhibited both short- and long-duration spectral declines and variable recovery rates. Although temporally variable, insect-affected stands generally conformed to four spectral trajectories: short-duration decline then recovery, short- then long-duration decline, long-duration decline, long-duration decline then recovery. When comparing remote sensing data with field measurements of insect impacts, we found that spectral changes were related to cover-based estimates (tree basal area mortality R(adj)(2);= 0.40, F(1.34) = 24.76, P<0.0001] and down coarse woody detritus [R(adj)(2) = 0.29, F(1.32) = 14.72. P = 0.0006]). In contrast, ADS changes were related to count-based estimates (e.g., ADS mortality from mountain pine beetle positively correlated with ground-based counts [R(adj)(2) = 037, F(1.22) = 14.71, P= 0.0009]). Fine woody detritus and forest floor depth were not well correlated with Landsat- or aerial survey-based change metrics. By characterizing several distinct temporal manifestations of insect activity in conifer forests, this study demonstrates the utility of insect mapping methods that capture a wide range of spectral trajectories.

Observed decreases in snowpack across lower-elevation watersheds are broadly consistent with model predictions of anthropogenic climate change; however, the magnitude of the decreases across much of the Cascades, Northern Rockies and Sierra Nevada has exceeded predictions based solely on late 20th century anthropogenic warming. To resolve the disparity between observations and predictions, the influence of intramonthly variability associated with the Pacific-North American (PNA) pattern on both the percent of precipitation falling as snow and a proxy for snowmelt during late winter is examined. The PNA is shown to have a significant influence on the elevation of the freezing level across the Western United States, with positive values of the PNA generally associated with anomalously high freezing levels. The positive tendency of the PNA during late winter over the last half-century has contributed to regional increases in the elevation of the freezing level, decreases in the percent of precipitation falling as snow, and increases in snowmelt across montane and sub-montane regions.

However, wildfire has the potential to reverse this benefit. In the western United States, climate change and land management practices have led to increases in wildfire intensity and size. One potential means of reducing carbon emissions from wildfire is the use of prescribed burning,which consumes less biomass and therefore releases less carbon to the atmosphere. This study uses a regional fire emissions model to estimate the potential reduction in fire emissions when prescribed burning is applied in dry, temperate forested systems of the western U.S. Daily carbon dioxide (CO2) fire emissions for 2001-2008 were calculated for the western U.S. for two cases: a default wildfire case and one in which prescribed burning was applied. Wide-scale prescribed fire application can reduce CO2 fire emissions for the western U.S. by 18-25% in the western U.S., and by as much as 60% in specific forest systems.

Tree-ring data were collected from 20 mature stands of white spruce (Picea glauca), lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia), and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa). Linear relationships between annual growth variation and monthly and seasonal climate were quantified with correlation and regression analyses, and variation in climate-growth responses over a climatic gradient were quantified by regressing growth responses against local mean climatic conditions. Temperatures had more consistent and stronger correlations with growth for all three species than precipitation, but growth-climate responses varied among species and among sites. In particular, pine and fir populations showed different responses between BC and Yukon, whereas spruce showed a more consistent response across the study domain. Results indicate that (1) the response and sensitivity of trees to seasonal climate variables vary among species and sites and (2) winter temperatures prior to growth may have significant impacts on pine and fir growth at some sites. The capacity to adapt to climate change will likely vary among the study species and across climatic gradients, which will have implications for the future management of mixed-species forests in Yukon and BC.

1106,NA,"Jackson, Scott I.; Prowse, Terry D.",Spatial variation of snowmelt and sublimation in a high-elevation semi-desert basin of western Canada,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"The Okanagan Basin, a semi-desert region of western Canada, is currently experiencing rapidly increasing pressure on its water resources from development and population increases, exacerbated by changes in mate. The major source of freshwater in the region originates from the melt of high-elevation snowpacks, about which little is currently known, including the proportion of the peak snowpack lost to sublimation. To better understand the hydrologic regime of this snow resource, a detailed field program was conducted during the 2007 snowmelt season. Specifically, peak annual snow distribution, ablation-season Surface-energy exchange and mass balance were measured in a forested high-elevation catchment of the Okanagan Basin. During the snowmelt period, 1-4% of the peak annual snow-water equivalent (SWE) was lost to sublimation in open sites-averaging 0.4 min d(-1). Melt and sublimation rates increased significantly with elevation, and were observed to be higher and more variable in the open sites than under forest canopies. The largest sublimation events (>0.25 mm d(-1)) were associated with low atmospheric vapour pressure, temperatures below 0 degrees C, and higher than average wind speeds. Condensation occurred under highly stable conditions in the boundary layer when sensible heat fluxes exceeded net radiative inputs to the snow surface. Melt rates were driven almost entirely by sensible heat fluxes and exceeded 30 mm d(-1) during large-scale advection events. The results from this Study will allow water managers to better predict the amount of water available for ecological, agricultural and municipal needs. This work also provides the basis for assessing changes in snow surface energetics due to ongoing salvage cutting in forested areas affected by the current mountain pine-beetle outbreak.

However there are few, if any, models directly connecting phenology with population growth rates. In this paper we discuss connecting a distributional model describing mountain pine beetle phenology with a model of population success measured using annual growth rates derived from aerially detected counts of infested trees. This model bridges the gap between phenology predictions and population viability/growth rates for mountain pine beetle. The model is parameterized and compared with 8 years of data from a recent outbreak in central Idaho, and is driven using measured tree phloem temperatures from north and south bole aspects and cumulative forest area impacted. A model driven by observed south-side phloem temperatures and that includes a correction for forest area previously infested and killed is most predictive and generates realistic parameter values of mountain pine beetle fecundity and population growth.

ADAMS, WASHINGTON",PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY,"A wealth of 20(th)-century instrumental data indicates that daytime near-surface temperatures differ greatly between clear-cut and mature forest stands, decreasing approximately linearly with stand height and density. Although these temperatures are easily observed in individual stands, extrapolating the net temperature effect to an actively logged terrain is difficult due to the heterogeneous mixture of different forest stand heights and densities. Previous work has related the percentage of tree shade observed in remotely sensed imagery to forest stand structure; we further developed this proxy to derive an estimate of the near-surface daytime air temperature during the summer months. This temperature proxy can be integrated across a region using both actual shade from the modern landscape and an idealized data set representing old-growth forest. In our 10 x 20 km study area on Mt. Adams, Washington, the temperature difference between these two data sets implies that as much as 0.6 degrees C of recent near-surface air temperature rise may be attributed to land cover change. Our results demonstrate that differences in regional temperatures caused by industrial-scale logging are large enough to play a significant role in other physical system responses, such as the retreat of alpine glaciers near logged forests. Because industrial-scale logging is globally pervasive and operates in the same timescale and direction as global warming trends, forcings due to land cover change may have been heretofore overlooked as a cause of the retreat of some glacier systems.",2009,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Physical Geography; Geology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Article,near-surface temperature; land cover change; Cascades; spectral mixture analysis,web_of_science,Yes,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to examine the potential shifts in spatial distribution of three tree-line conifer species in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem under three future climate-change scenarios and to assess their potential sensitivity to changes in both temperature and precipitation. Location This study was performed using data from 275 sites within the boundaries of Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks, primarily located in Wyoming, USA. Methods We used data on tree-line conifer presence from the US Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis Program. Climatic and edaphic variables were derived from spatially interpolated maps and approximated for each of the sites. We used the random-forest prediction method to build a model of predicted current and future distributions of each of the species under various climate-change scenarios. Results We had good success in predicting the distribution of tree-line conifer species currently and under future climate scenarios. Temperature and temperature-related variables appeared to be most influential in the distribution of whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis), whereas precipitation and soil variables dominated the models for subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) and Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii). The model for whitebark pine substantially overpredicted absences (as compared with the other models), which is probably a result of the importance of biological factors in the distribution of this species. Main conclusions These models demonstrate the complex response of conifer distributions to changing climate scenarios. Whitebark pine is considered a 'keystone' species in the subalpine forests of western North America; however, it is believed to be nearly extinct throughout a substantial portion of its range owing to the combined effects of an introduced pathogen, outbreaks of the native mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae), and changing fire regimes. Given predicted changes in climate, it is reasonable to predict an overall decrease in pine-dominated subalpine forests in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. In order to manage these forests effectively with respect to future climate, it may be important to focus attention on monitoring dry mid- and high-elevation forests as harbingers of long-term change.",2008,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Physical Geography,Article,biophysical variables; climate change; climate variability; Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem; Pinus albicaulis; random forest model; species distribution; tree-line conifer distributions,web_of_science,Yes,,,,,,

Meanwhile, conifer forests in unburned parts of the GYE have continued to increase in extent and density. Conifer cover increase has been well documented by repeat historical photography, but the average rate of increase and the spatial variation remain unquantified. We examined changes in conifer cover across biophysical gradients in the GYE based on stratified random samples from aerial photographs. The percent conifer cover for samples in 1971 and 1999 was quantified to determine the frequency and rate of conifer cover change. A slight majority of samples (56%) showed no change, whereas increases (22%) were balanced by decreases (22%). However, among samples that were not recently burned or logged, or already closed-canopy, nearly 40% increased in conifer cover, at an average annual rate of 0.22%. We quantified significant variability in the frequency and rate of conifer cover increase across gradients of elevation, aspect, vegetation type, and proximity to nearby conifer forest. The most dynamic locations were low density conifer woodlands on northerly aspects at lower elevations, with average annual rates of increase up to 0.51%. This study is significant because it demonstrates that rates of conifer cover increase vary across biophysical gradients, an important consideration for management of dynamic forest ecosystems.

Mortality has been extensive, and projected potential range shifts based on impending climate change have revealed further pressures to survival and adaptation for this long-lived, high-elevation conifer. Quantifying genetic variation and the mating system of whitebark pine in its northern range provides a basis for effective conservation measures. Isozyme analysis of vegetative bud tissue revealed high expected heterozygosity (0.262), moderate population differentiation (F-ST = 0.061) and highly significant correlations between observed heterozygosity and geographic variables (R-2 = 0.36, latitude; R-2 = 0.30 longitude), supporting the hypothesis that this species recolonized its current northern range following glacial retreat from several refugia in the Washington and Oregon Cascades and in the northern Rockies. Mating system analysis based on simultaneous isozyme analyses of embryo and haploid megagametophyte tissues found relatively high levels of consanguineous mating and selfing for a conifer (t(m) = 0.73) within populations. Avian seed distribution by the Clark's nutcracker (Nucifragia columbiana Wilson) appears to be the overriding factor influencing genetic patterns: being a mutualistic seed disperser, caches comprised of related seeds develop into clumped stands with strong family substructure. While it is a critical wildlife habitat component, lack of commercial utilization has made in situ adaptation the primary conservation focus. Encouraging regeneration success and nutcracker caching by maintaining natural fire regimes will provide an ecosystem-based conservation solution; however, in the Rocky Mountains between 52degreesN and 47degreesN, disease-resistant individuals should be located and propagated in order to ensure long-term survival of the species in high pathogen hazard areas.",2003,Biodiversity & Conservation; Genetics & Heredity,Article,mating system; Nucifragia columbiana; Pinus albicaulis; population structure,web_of_science,Yes,,,,,,

Climate scenarios generated by climate models at spatial resolutions ranging from about 50 km to 400 km may not provide enough spatial specificity for use in impact assessment. In Parts I and II of this paper. the spatial specificity issue is addressed by examining what information on mesoscale and small-scale spatial features can be gained by using a regional climate model with a subgrid parameterization of orographic precipitation and land surface cover, driven by a general circulation model. Numerical experiments have been performed to simulate the present-day climatology and the climate conditions corresponding to a doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentration. This paper describes and contrasts the large-scale and mesoscale features of the greenhouse warming climate signals simulated by the general circulation modal and regional climate model over the Pacific Northwest. Results indicate that changes in the large-scale circulation exhibit strong seasonal variability. There is an average warming of about 2 degrees C, and precipitation generally increases over the Pacific Northwest and decreases over California. The precipitation signal over the Pacific Northwest is only statistically significant during spring, when both the change in the large-scale circulation and increase in water vapor enhance the moisture convergence toward the north Pacific coast. The combined effects of surface temperature and precipitation changes are such that snow cover is reduced by up to 50% on average, causing large changes in the seasonal runoff. This paper also describes the high spatial resolution (1.5 km) climate signals simulated by the regional climate model. Reductions in snow cover of 50%-90% are found in areas near the snow line of the control simulation. Analyses of the variations of the climate signals with surface elevation ranging from sea level to 4000 m over two mountain ranges in the Pacific Northwest show that because of changes in the alitude of the freezing level, strong elevation dependency is found in the surface temperature, rainfall. snowfall, snow cover, and runoff signals.",1999,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Article,NA,web_of_science,Yes,,,,,,

High-elevation coastal forests may either remain stable or decrease in productivity, while interior subalpine forests may eventually resemble those now found in the coastal mountains. Southern interior forests are likely to persist relatively unchanged, while boreal and sub-boreal forests of the northern interior may become dominated by Douglas-fir and western larch, rather than by spruce and pine as at present.

Species-specific and treatment-specific differences in leaf temperature, high-temperature tolerance and chlorophyll a fluorescence from photosystem II were compared, to test the hypothesis that plants at ecosystem borders will exhibit species-specific responses to climate change. Measurements were made for plants ex posed to a climate change warming manipulation on a major ecosystem border at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory, Colorado, United States, in July and Au gust 1995. In July, daily maximal leaf temperatures were significantly higher for P. gracilis than for A. tridentata. Leaf temperatures were slightly lower in August than July for leaves of both species, on control and heated plots, despite the fact that daily maximum air temperatures were not significantly different for the two months. High-temperature tolerance was determined for leaves treated for 1 h at temperatures ranging from 15 degrees C to 65 degrees C. LT(50) was approximately 46 degrees C for both species on control plots, but was 43 degrees C for leaves of both species from heated plots, contrary to the predictions of the hypothesis.

Large differences in microclimate occur with small changes in elevation, and this complex interaction is an important determinant of mountain plant distributions. In spite of this, elevation is not often considered as a relevant predictor in species distribution models (SDMs) for mountain plants. Here, we evaluated the importance of including elevation as a predictor in SDMs for mountain plant species. We generated two sets of SDMs for each of 73 plant species that occur in the Pacific Northwest of North America; one set of models included elevation as a predictor variable and the other set did not. AUC scores indicated that omitting elevation as a predictor resulted in a negligible reduction of model performance. However, further analysis revealed that the omission of elevation resulted in large over-predictions of species' niche breadths this effect was most pronounced for species that occupy the highest elevations. In addition, the inclusion of elevation as a predictor constrained the effects of other predictors that superficially affected the outcome of the models generated without elevation. Our results demonstrate that the inclusion of elevation as a predictor variable improves the quality of SDMs for high-elevation plant species. Because of the negligible AUC score penalty for over-predicting niche breadth, our results support the notion that AUC scores alone should not be used as a measure of model quality. More generally, our results illustrate the importance of selecting biologically relevant predictor variables when constructing SDMs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Persistent changes in the rate of chronic or background mortality can dramatically alter the structure and composition of forests stands.

The purpose of this study is to ascertain trends of mortality and recruitment in mature and old-growth forests in western Washington state, U.S.A. We used a set of permanent plots established in units of the National Park System spanning the environmental gradient of forests in these parks (from near sea-level to 1800 m elevation). Duration of observation was five years for most plots and two or three years for a small number of plots. Principal tree species on the plots were Picea sitchensis, Tsuga heterophylla, Pseudotsuga menziesii, Thuja plicata, Abies lasiocarpa, and Abies amabilis. Tree mortality was evaluated annually; recruitment was recorded at the end of the study. For small (dbh 12.7-76.1 cm) and large (dbh >76.1 cm) trees, annual mortality pooled across all elevations, parks, plots, and years was <1% (mean and upper 95% confidence intervals). For saplings (dbh 2.5-12.6 cm), mean mortality was <1% though the upper limit of the confidence interval was slightly greater than 1%. Recruitment outweighed mortality (and growth into the small-tree class) for saplings. Recruitment and losses of stems balanced one another for small trees; both processes were negligible for large trees. Recruitment of saplings increased representation of shade-tolerant species (e.g., T. heterophylla, and A. amabilis). Biotic factors predominated as the proximate cause of death for all size-classes of trees (i.e., trees died standing), though particular agents of mortality were not identified in most cases.

Montane ecoregions are occupied by subspecies vaseyana, while subspecies wyomingensis and tridentata occupy basin ecoregions. In cases of wide-ranging species with multiple subspecies, it can be more practical from the scientific and management perspective to assess the climate profiles at the subspecies level. We focus bioclimatic model efforts on subspecies wyomingensis, which is the most widespread and abundant of the subspecies and critical habitat to wildlife including sage-grouse and pygmy rabbits. Using absence points from species with allopatric ranges to Wyoming big sagebrush (i.e.. targeted groups absences) and randomly sampled points from specific ecoregions, we modeled the climatic envelope for subspecies wyomingensis using Random Forests multiple-regression tree for contemporary and future climates (decade 2050). Overall model error was low, at 4.5%, with the vast majority accounted for by errors in commission (>99.9%).

This paper explores these regime shifts by building upon a hydroclimatic classification system that partitions the United States into clusters of similarly behaved catchments using four simple hydroclimatic indicators. Hydroclimate data from over four hundred catchments over a 55 year period (belonging to the MOPEX data set) are analyzed to reveal how the indicators have shifted before and after 1970, before and after 1975, and before and after 1980. Statistically significant hydroclimatic changes in these indicators are explored qualitatively, suggesting which catchments today might resemble other catchments tomorrow. Thus, a preview of current locations in one class under future conditions is provided by observing existing locations of another class. The classification system structure enables organization of these data, allowing patterns of regime change to emerge without highly specified models at each individual site. Regional analyses explore changes in mean seasonal precipitation/runoff regimes, including shifts in the daily variability of precipitation and runoff. Additionally, changes in regime curves of minimum and maximum precipitation/runoff observations are analyzed and discussed. Results indicate that after 1980, classifications typically found in the southeastern quarter of the United States have expanded northward and westward. Regionally, the Midwest and Rocky Mountains seem to demonstrate more frequent, but less intense storms after 1980, while southeastern catchments receive much less water in the form of precipitation and runoff than in previous years.

Plastic behavioral responses, especially in foraging, may be critical for specialists to tolerate changes in temperature, precipitation, and resource availability. Here, we investigate the foraging behavior of a mammalian alpine specialist living in atypical habitat. American pikas (Ochotona princeps) are typically limited to high elevations in western North America; however, they persist near sea level in the Columbia River Gorge, well outside their previously assumed climatic niche. We hypothesized that utilizing unusual food resources contributes to pika persistence in this unusual climate. Moss comprised more than 60% of the diet at 2 sites, more than observed for any mammalian herbivore in the wild.

To gain insight into how these ecosystems respond, we quantified vegetation change over 2 decades (21-29 y) in xeric and submesic P. albicaulis ecosystems near the northern edge of the species' range on the leeward side of the Coast Mountains of British Columbia, Canada. We compared changes in overstory and understory vegetation composition of these stands to changes in mesic, non-whitebark pine ecosystems in the same region. Multi-response permutation procedure (MRPP) analysis showed that the overstory of xeric whitebark pine ecosystems became compositionally similar to mesic ecosystems, i.e., there was increased dominance by Abies lasiocarpa or Tsuga mertensiana. Yet understory composition in xeric whitebark pine stands changed little and there was continued regeneration of P. albicaulis. Submesic whitebark pine stands developed a dense canopy dominated by T. mertensiana, and although their understories did not become compositionally similar to mesic ecosystems, there was minimal P. albicaulis regeneration. Understory stability in xeric and submesic whitebark pine ecosystems over 21-29 y suggests compositional resilience in these ecosystems to multiple stresses and disturbances. However, ongoing disturbance affecting both overstory and understory P. albicaulis might still result in the loss of this keystone species.",2014,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Article,cumulative disturbance; forest change; Pinus albicaulis; resilience,web_of_science,Yes,,,,,,

Four glacial/non-glacial catchment pairs were considered, two from the southern Canadian Rocky Mountains and two from arctic coastal Norway. Analyses were performed using daily data, providing high seasonal resolution and facilitating the identification of possible nonlinear hydroclimatic processes. Spearman rank correlation, and an information theory-based polynomial selection method, were employed in parallel. The latter permits straightforward identification of highly nonlinear relationships, simultaneous consideration of multiple models and estimation of the probability of a given relationship, as distinct from conventional p-values. Highly nonlinear (parabolic) atmospheric teleconnections to the Arctic Oscillation and El Nino-Southern Oscillation were confirmed in Norway and Canada, respectively, and their corresponding hydrologic effects were detected; conversely, little evidence for deviation from linearity was found for long-term monotonic trends. Presence or absence of watershed glacial cover was found to fundamentally alter streamflow responses to climate variability and change. In particular, for ecologically highly relevant late-summer low flows, glaciers induced: (1) stronger negative long-term trends than observed for non-glacial basins, presumably reflecting net mass balance declines seen in nearby glaciers, and (2) parabolic teleconnections, largely absent in non-glacial basins, reflecting parabolic air temperature teleconnections and the presence or absence of glacial ice available for melting.",2014,Water Resources,Article,NA,web_of_science,Yes,,,,,,

Lower-troposphere winter (November to March) westerlies are strongly correlated with high-elevation precipitation but weakly correlated with low-elevation precipitation. Decreases in lower-tropospheric winter westerlies across the region from 1950 to 2012 are hypothesized to have reduced orographic precipitation enhancement, yielding differential trends in precipitation across elevations and contributing to the decline in annual streamflow.

We developed a decision support process for adapting salmon recovery plans that incorporates (1) local habitat factors limiting salmon recovery, (2) scenarios of climate change effects on stream flow and temperature, (3) the ability of restoration actions to ameliorate climate change effects, and (4) the ability of restoration actions to increase habitat diversity and salmon population resilience. To facilitate the use of this decision support framework, we mapped scenarios of future stream flow and temperature in the Pacific Northwest region and reviewed literature on habitat restoration actions to determine whether they ameliorate a climate change effect or increase life history diversity and salmon resilience. Under the climate change scenarios considered here, summer low flows decrease by 35-75% west of the Cascade Mountains, maximum monthly flows increase by 10-60% across most of the region, and stream temperatures increase between 2 and 6 degrees C by 2070-2099. On the basis of our literature review, we found that restoring floodplain connectivity, restoring stream flow regimes, and re-aggrading incised channels are most likely to ameliorate stream flow and temperature changes and increase habitat diversity and population resilience. By contrast, most restoration actions focused on in-stream rehabilitation are unlikely to ameliorate climate change effects. Finally, we illustrate how the decision support process can be used to evaluate whether climate change should alter the types or priority of restoration actions in a salmon habitat restoration plan.

A high-spatial-resolution multidimensional hydrodynamics model was used to assess the degree of scour risk in low-gradient unconfined gravel bed channels that are the favored environment for autumn-spawning salmon in mountain watersheds such as the Middle Fork Salmon River (MFSR), Idaho. In one of the most important MFSR spawning tributaries, near-bed shear stresses were relatively low at all discharges from base flows to 300% of bankfull. The highest stresses were found only in small areas of the central flow core and not at spawning sites. Median shear stresses did not increase in overbank flow conditions because poor channel confinement released the excess water into adjacent floodplains. Channel and floodplain topography, rather than discharge, control the maximum near-bed shear stresses. Over the modeled range of discharges, similar to 2% of the total surface area of the main stem channel bed was predicted to be mobile. Even in known spawning areas, where shear stresses are higher, 20% of the spawning surface area was mobile during overbank flows with a 2year recurrence interval. Field measurements of little gravel transport during flows that were 93% of bankfull support the numerical model predictions. Regardless of some uncertainty in future climates in these watersheds, there appears to be relatively limited risk of extensive scour at salmon spawning sites in any likely hydrologic regimes.",2013,Geology,Review,bed scour; salmon spawning; climate change; unconfined channels,web_of_science,Yes,,,,,,

With rapid climate change expected in the coming decades, ecologists have predicted that species ranges will shift large distances in elevation and latitude. However, most range shift assessments are based on coarse-scale climate models that ignore fine-scale heterogeneity and could fail to capture important range shift dynamics. Moreover, if climate varies dramatically over short distances, some populations of certain species may only need to migrate tens of meters between microhabitats to track their climate as opposed to hundreds of meters upward or hundreds of kilometers poleward. To address these issues, we measured climate variables that are likely important determinants of plant species distributions and abundances (snow disappearance date and soil temperature) at coarse and fine scales at Mount Rainier National Park in Washington State, USA. Coarse-scale differences across the landscape such as large changes in elevation had expected effects on climatic variables, with later snow disappearance dates and lower temperatures at higher elevations. However, locations separated by small distances (similar to 20 m), but differing by vegetation structure or topographic position, often experienced differences in snow disappearance date and soil temperature as great as locations separated by large distances (>1 km). Tree canopy gaps and topographic depressions experienced later snow disappearance dates than corresponding locations under intact canopy and on ridges. Additionally, locations under vegetation and on topographic ridges experienced lower maximum and higher minimum soil temperatures. The large differences in climate we observed over small distances will likely lead to complex range shift dynamics and could buffer species from the negative effects of climate change.",NA,NA,Article,NA,web_of_science,Yes,,,,,,

To assess the possibility that the declines have arisen from climate-related factors, several experiments were conducted to determine the upper thermal tolerances of embryos and fry and the effects of temperature on growth. Hatching of eggs was measured at 5.7, 6.4, 8.4, and 10.4 degrees C (three replicates each). Survival and growth of fry were measured for 33 d at 5.7, 8.2, 11.8, 16.5, 19.1, 22.2, and 25.2 degrees C (three replicates each). Mean hatching success was 96.7% (SD, 2.9) at 5.7 degrees C, 98.3% (2.9) at 6.4 degrees C, 90.0% (8.7) at 8.4 degrees C and 38.3% (10.4) at 10.4 degrees C. The ultimate upper incipient lethal temperature for fry was 23.6 degrees C (95% CI, 23.5-23.7 degrees C) after 7 d, which decreased with time to 22.6 degrees C (22.1-23.0 degrees C) after 33 d. The critical thermal maximum was 26.7 degrees C (SD, 0.8) for fry acclimated to 13.4 degrees C. The temperature for maximum growth was 13.8 degrees C (95% CI, 10.8-16.8 degrees C). Growth rates above and below the temperature for maximum growth decreased sharply to about 40% of the maximum at 5.7 degrees C and 22.2 degrees C. Based on these experimental data, the criteria for the protection of Mountain Whitefish fry are 21.6 degrees C for acute water temperature and 16.8 degrees C for chronic water temperature. The acute criterion for reproductionbased on the maximum temperature for successful incubationis 8.4 degrees C. The low upper thermal tolerance of Mountain Whitefish relative to those of other salmonids suggests that they will be very vulnerable to the increasing stream temperatures resulting from climate change.

The temperature signal within the chronologies is complex and strongly influenced by diverging trends in the summer temperature and ring-width records from across the region. A first differences transformation of the tree-ring and temperature records illustrates a loss of frequency coherence in growth response to summer temperatures following reduced radial growth in the 1950s. Prior to reduced growth, we note a positive association with summer temperatures for both first differenced (r(d) = 0.60) and traditional (r = 0.50) records. Following reduced growth, the association at first differences is maintained (r(d) = 0.49) whereas there is a change in the lower frequency component of tree growth response to summer temperatures (r = -0.34). We suggest the cause of this reduced temperature sensitivity is related to the interaction between diurnal temperature and cloud cover patterns, the hydrological regime of snowpack, and site conditions which have been amenable to the initiation of moisture stress during the latter half of the 20th century. Reduced radial growth is coincident with the arrival of white pine blister rust (Cronatium ribicola J.C. Fisch. ex Raben) into the study region which suggests this infestation may be related to the observed reduction in radial growth. Whitebark pine has considerable potential for the field of dendroclimatology. Unfortunately, the decline of the species due to the combined effects of climate change, white pine blister rust, mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopk.), and forest fire exclusion practices indicate this potential may remain unfulfilled.

Seven years (six winters) from 2000 to 2006 are simulated at 4 km resolution to assess the similarities and differences between the two models as well as the implications for hydrologic modeling. Inherent biases in both approaches are apparent, highlighting the difficulty in climate model validation. Results show general agreement between the two models in the spatial distribution of winter precipitation. A principal component analysis shows similar spatial patterns between models in the leading six components suggesting that the main processes that drive the spatial distribution of precipitation were properly captured. The first component explains almost 70% of total variance, and the first three components explain more than 85% in both data sets. The largest differences between the two data sets exist in areas at high elevation and upstream of the continental divide where observations are sparse. In these areas, WRF consistently predicts higher amounts of precipitation and larger interannual variability than PRISM. We suggest that these results are realistic for impingement of moist air masses on topography and, if correct, could have significant implications in flood forecasting, water resource management, and climate change studies.

The intent is to develop an approach that is more practical in terms of data and analysis requirements than current approaches, informed by the literature and experience with probability elicitation and judgmental forecasting. The context involves decisions about managing forest lands that have been severely affected by mountain pine beetles in British Columbia, a pest infestation that is climate-exacerbated. A forest management decision was developed as the basis for the context, objectives, and alternatives for land management actions, to frame and condition the judgments. A wide range of climate forecasts, taken to represent the 1090% levels on cumulative distributions for future climate, were developed to condition judgments. An elicitation instrument was developed, tested, and revised to serve as the basis for eliciting probabilistic three-point distributions regarding the performance of selected alternatives, over a set of relevant objectives, in the short and long term. The elicitations were conducted in a workshop comprising 14 regional forest management specialists. We employed the concept of stochastic dominance to help identify robust alternatives. We used extensive sensitivity analysis to explore the patterns in the judgments, and also considered the preferred alternatives for each individual expert.

The purpose of this study was to determine if: (1) Mean August stream discharge values have decreased over the last half-century; (2) Low discharge values are occurring more frequently; (3) Climatic variables are influencing August discharge trends. Here we use a strict selection process to characterize gauging stations based on amount of anthropogenic impact in order to identify heavily impacted rivers and understand the relationship between climatic variables and discharge trends. Using historic United States Geologic Survey discharge data, we analyzed data for trends of 40-59 years. Combining of these records along with aerial photos and water rights records we selected gauging stations based on the length and continuity of discharge records and categorized each based on the amount of diversion.

We collected stand- and tree-level data in three whitebark pine systems in the southern Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem to evaluate current conditions and to determine how characteristics of individual whitebark pine trees, including the presence and severity of white pine blister rust, influence host selection by the MPB.

Whitebark pine trees that were selected as hosts by MPB exhibited significantly greater blister rust severity than trees that were not selected. Multiple logistic regression analyses identified a complex set of tree characteristics related to host selection by MPB; in addition to rust severity, stand type (mixed species or pure whitebark pine) and tree diameter were also significant predictors of selection.

A relation between rock slope instabilities in cold high mountain areas and climate change is currently becoming more evident and questions about possible consequences and hazard scenarios in densely populated high mountain regions leading beyond historical precedence are rising. To improve hazard assessment of potential rock-ice avalanches, their mobility is a critical factor. This contribution is an attempt to unravel driving factors for the mobility of large rock-ice avalanches by synthesizing results from physical laboratory experiments and empirical data from 64 rock-ice avalanches with volumes > 1x10(6) m(3) from glacierized high mountain regions around the world. The influence of avalanche volume, water and ice content, low-friction surfaces, and topography on the apparent coefficient of friction (as a measure of mobility) is assessed. In laboratory experiments granular ice in the moving mass was found to reduce bulk friction up to 20% while water led to a reduction around 50% for completely saturated material compared with dry flows. Evidence for the effects of water as a key driving factor to enhance mobility was also found in the empirical data, while the influence of the ice content could not be confirmed to be of much relevance in nature. Besides liquefaction, it was confirmed that mobility increases with volumes and that frictional surface characteristics such as flow paths over glaciers are also dominant variables determining mass movement mobility. Effects of the topography along the flow path as well as channeling are assumed to be other critical factors. The results provide an empirical basis to roughly account for different path and flow characteristics of large rock-ice avalanches and to find appropriate ranges for friction parameters for scenario modeling and hazard assessments.

Location: The forested region of the Pacific Northwest, United States and Canada. Methods: We first mapped monthly climatic data, averaged for the period 1950 to 1975 at 1 km resolution across the region. The recorded presence and absence of 15 native tree species were next mapped at 1 km resolution from data acquired on 22 771 field survey plots. To establish seasonal limits on photosynthesis and water use, a process-based growth model (3-PG, Physiological Processes to Predict Growth) was parameterized for Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), one of the most widely distributed species in the region. Automated decision tree analyses were used to predict the distribution of different species by creating a suite of rules associated with the relative constraints that soil drought, atmospheric humidity deficits, suboptimal and subfreezing temperatures would impose on the growth of Douglas-fir. Results: The 3-PG process-based modeling approach, combined with automated decision tree analyses, predicted presence and absence of 15 conifers on field survey plots with an average accuracy of 82 +/- 12%. Predictive models of current distribution for each species differed in the number of, order in, and physiological thresholds selected. A deficit in the soil water balance, followed by departures from optimum temperatures in the summer were the two most important variables selected in predicting species distributions. Conclusions: Although empirical models using different sampling techniques and statistical analyses may be more accurate in predicting current distribution of species, the hybrid approach presented in this paper provides a greater mechanistic understanding of the limits to growth and tree distributions.

The dissimilar geology and geomorphic processes of the western national parks suggest that treeline may respond differently between national parks when subjected to disturbance. Therefore, predicted vegetation response to disturbance across the western USA may provide a limited assessment of change beyond fine-scale analysis due to data collection from a limited number of national parks containing alpine treeline. We performed a content analysis on previous research that examined alpine treeline in national parks and classified each treeline study as anthropogenic, orographic/edaphic, or climatic according to the primary factor attributed to treeline control. Results indicated that the three types of treeline are not uniformly studied. Climatic treeline is most commonly studied whereas anthropogenic and orographic/edaphic studies are often lacking.

Individual populations evolved distinct life history characteristics in response to the diverse environments in which they were isolated after the last glaciation. Anthropogenic activities have resulted in a substantial decline (42% of the historical range is currently occupied; 28% is occupied by core [genetically unaltered] populations), but the number of extant populations, especially in headwater streams, has precluded listing of this taxon under the Endangered Species Act. Primary threats to persistence of Yellowstone cutthroat trout include (1) invasive species, resulting in hybridization, predation, disease, and interspecific competition; (2) habitat degradation from human activities such as agricultural practices, water diversions, grazing, dam construction, mineral extraction, grazing, timber harvest, and road construction; and (3) climate change, including an escalating risk of drought, wildfire, winter flooding, and rising temperatures. Extirpation of individual populations or assemblages has led to increasing isolation and fragmentation of remaining groups, which in turn raises susceptibility to the demographic influences of disturbance (both human and stochastic) and genetic factors.

In the dry conifer, montane, and subalpine forest sites, increases in Pseudotsuga menziesii, Abies grandis, and Abies lasiocarpa, respectively, and decreases in Pinus ponderosa, Larix occidentalis, and Pinus contorta, respectively, have shifted species composition from fire and drought-tolerant species to shade-tolerant species. Fire suppression, grazing, and logging explain changes in species composition more clearly than climate variation does, although the relative influence of these factors varies with elevation. Furthermore, some of the observed changes in composition are opposite what we expect would be most suited to projected future climates. Natural resource managers need to recognize that the current state of an ecosystem reflects historical land uses, and that contemporary management actions can have long-term effects on ecosystem structure. Understanding the processes that generated an ecosystem's current structure will lead to more informed management decisions to effectively respond to projected climate changes. (C) 2010 Elsevier By.

Based on results from the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC AR4), we updated previous studies of implications of climate change on PNW hydrology. PNW 21st century hydrology was simulated using 20 Global Climate Models (GCMs) and 2 greenhouse gas emissions scenarios over Washington and the greater Columbia River watershed, with additional focus on the Yakima River watershed and the Puget Sound which are particularly sensitive to climate change. We evaluated projected changes in snow water equivalent (SWE), soil moisture, runoff, and streamflow for A1B and B1 emissions scenarios for the 2020s, 2040s, and 2080s. April 1 SWE is projected to decrease by approximately 38-46% by the 2040s (compared with the mean over water years 1917-2006), based on composite scenarios of B1 and A1B, respectively, which represent average effects of all climate models. In three relatively warm transient watersheds west of the Cascade crest, April 1 SWE is projected to almost completely disappear by the 2080s. By the 2080s, seasonal streamflow timing will shift significantly in both snowmelt dominant and rain-snow mixed watersheds. Annual runoff across the State is projected to increase by 2-3% by the 2040s; these changes are mainly driven by projected increases in winter precipitation.",NA,NA,Article,NA,web_of_science,Yes,,,,,,

A.",Future quantities and spatial distribution of harvesting residue and dead wood from natural disturbances in Canada,FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT,"Interest in the use of bioenergy is increasing because of the need to mitigate climate change, the increasing costs and finite supply of fossil fuels, and the declining price of lumber and paper. Sound bioenergy policies must be informed by accurate estimates of potential feedstock production, rights to the production, social values and economics. Two of the main sources of bioenergy feedstock from forests are (i) harvesting residue and (ii) dead wood resulting from natural disturbances (i.e. standing dead timber). We modeled the production of bioenergy feedstock from these two sources from 2005 to 2020 for Canada's managed forest south of 60 degrees N so that this information can be used in provincial and national strategic planning. Published estimates of harvesting residue vary widely, and our objective was to provide more precise estimates based on new forest inventory data and regional modeling. Natural disturbances result in very large quantities of dead wood on the landscape, but estimates of future stocks and annual production have not previously been made. Our estimates included a 50% discount factor to net-down theoretically available quantities to a more realistic estimate of potential ecologically sustainable bioenergy feedstock The total future annual production averaged 51 +/- 17 Tg year(-1) from natural disturbances and 20 +/- 0.6 Tg year(-1) from clearcut harvesting residues. Harvesting residue for the area logged varied spatially from a low of 1.0 +/- 0.77 kg m(-2) year(-1) to a high of 6.7 +/- 0.1 kg m(-2) year(-1). Dead wood production due to insects was forecast to peak in the Montane Cordillera of British Columbia (BC) at 16.7 Tg year(-1) due to the current mountain pine beetle outbreak. Total dead wood production due to fire was highest in the western portion of the boreal forest (3.6 Tg year(-1) in the Boreal Shield of Saskatchewan), in part due to the high frequency of fires in these ecosystems and the large area of western boreal forest, but the highest density production was in BC: >9 kg m(-2) year(-1) in the burned area. Our results showed that the dead wood stocks of 331 Tg oven-dry matter potentially available for bioenergy in 2020 are much smaller than the 3100 +/- 84 Tg of dead wood stocks estimated based on ecosystem dynamics. While bioenergy use will accelerate the release of greenhouse gases compared to on-site decay, the energy is renewable and can be used as a substitute for fossil fuels. The net benefit to the atmosphere of forest bioenergy use is affected by many factors, and future research should further assess which sustainable wood-based bioenergy strategies yield the greatest net greenhouse gas benefits over the different time scales needed for post-disturbance forest recovery.

We regress observed area burned onto observed meteorological fields and fire indices from the Canadian Fire Weather Index system and find that May-October mean temperature and fuel moisture explain 24-57% of the variance in annual area burned in this region. Applying meteorological fields calculated by a general circulation model (GCM) to our regression model, we show that increases in temperature cause annual mean area burned in the western United States to increase by 54% by the 2050s relative to the present day. Changes in area burned are ecosystem dependent, with the forests of the Pacific Northwest and Rocky Mountains experiencing the greatest increases of 78 and 175%, respectively. Increased area burned results in near doubling of wildfire carbonaceous aerosol emissions by midcentury. Using a chemical transport model driven by meteorology from the same GCM, we calculate that climate change will increase summertime organic carbon (OC) aerosol concentrations over the western United States by 40% and elemental carbon (EC) concentrations by 20% from 2000 to 2050. Most of this increase (75% for OC and 95% for EC) is caused by larger wildfire emissions with the rest caused by changes in meteorology and for OC by increased monoterpene emissions in a warmer climate.

Geographical regions, latitude bands, and elevation classes where these trends are statistically significantly different from trends associated with natural climate variations are identified. Variables analyzed include late-winter and spring temperature, winter-total snowy days as a fraction of winter-total wet days, 1 April snow water equivalent (SWE) as a fraction of October-March (ONDJFM) precipitation total [precip(ONDJFM)], and seasonal [JFM] accumulated runoff as a fraction of water-year accumulated runoff. Observed changes were compared to natural internal climate variability simulated by an 850-yr control run of the finite volume version of the Community Climate System Model, version 3 (CCSM3-FV), statistically downscaled to a (1)/(8)degrees grid using the method of constructed analogs. Both observed and downscaled model temperature and precipitation data were then used to drive the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrological model to obtain the hydrological variables analyzed in this study. Large trends (magnitudes found less than 5% of the time in the long control run) are common in the observations and occupy a substantial part (37%-42%) of the mountainous western United States. These trends are strongly related to the large-scale warming that appears over 89% of the domain. The strongest changes in the hydrologic variables, unlikely to be associated with natural variability alone, have occurred at medium elevations [750-2500 m for JFM runoff fractions and 500-3000 m for SWE/Precip(ONDJFM)] where warming has pushed temperatures from slightly below to slightly above freezing.

In this paper, we develop a simple conceptual model that links the timing of peak snowmelt with geologically mediated differences in rate of streamflow recession. This model demonstrates that within the western United States, spatial differences in subsurface drainage rates can exacerbate summer streamflow losses associated with diminishing snowpacks. Application of a process-based hydrologic model to four watersheds in the Western Cordillera further reveals that contingent on timing of snowmelt, slower draining watersheds are likely to have more water in summer but paradoxically are subject to the greatest summer water losses under a 1.5 degrees C warming scenario. A slow draining watershed located in the young volcanic arc of the High Cascades in Oregon shows 4 times the summer streamflow reduction when compared with faster draining watersheds with similar timing of peak snowmelt. On the other hand, watersheds where snowmelt occurs late in the season but have little groundwater influence show high relative sensitivities to snowpack changes due to warming, as shown by a high-elevation granitic Sierran watershed.

Nothing comparable to this extant biome existed during the global ""greenhouse"" interval of the Late Mesozoic and Paleogene. Latitudinal temperature gradients should have confined boreal taxa to extremely high latitudes, but evergreen taxa do not appear to have been competitive in the lowlands of the high arctic, where the vegetation consisted of a unique circumpolar forest dominated by deciduous conifers and broad-leaved taxa. Probable sources for the pinaceous taxa that now characterize boreal latitudes were the Paleogene evergreen montane coniferous forests of the western North American Cordillera. Taphonomic factors limit the fossil record for such forests, but assemblages such as the Eocene Thunder Mountain (Idaho) and Bull Run (Nevada) floras were dominated by evergreen and deciduous Pinaceae that dominate extant montane, subalpine, and Boreal Forest associations. In response to post-Eocene global cooling, such forests presumably would have migrated to lower elevations, eventually spreading across high-latitude North America, subsequently reaching Eurasia via the Beringian corridor. This high-diversity coniferous forest was differentially winnowed and modified during subsequent migration southward in both the New and Old World. Despite its extensive geographic distribution, the Boreal Forest may be the youngest of the major forest biomes. If global warming ultimately results in a significant redistribution of terrestrial vegetation, the history of the Boreal Forest may well be reversed. Northward migration of the Boreal Forest may be characterized by loss of taxa and extensive community reorganization as individual taxa are pushed to their limits with respect to rates of migration and biotic stress takes its toll in the form of insect predation and disease. If evergreen taxa are unable to survive at low elevations at high polar latitudes, such conifers might once again become restricted to montane refugia and the lowlands of the high arctic would be populated by a larch-dominated deciduous conifer forest of low diversity and limited geographic extent. Given the biogeographic significance of the Boreal Forest biome, such a consequence would represent a profound ecological transformation. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The pollen data suggest little change in vegetation in the last 2 millennia, aside from a long-term trend toward more forest at the expense of steppe. One site showed an expansion of mesophytic taxa in the last 350 years as a result of local changes in hydrology, and another site was dry prior to AD 1000 and showed fluctuations in steppe composition thereafter. The longest record suggests that fire frequency was higher before AD 1200 than after.

However, similar to other studies, inflow nitrate concentrations were negatively correlated with relative forest cover. At the scale of individual lakes, dissolved organic carbon and dissolved organic nitrogen increased, and nitrate was significantly reduced from inflows to outflows.

In particular, glaciers can only be responsible for peak uplift if they are capable of generating significant relief in formerly nonglaciated landscapes. Previous work has suggested that relief in glaciated landscapes should scale with the thickness of the ice. Here we summarise a field-based test of this hypothesis in two mountain ranges in the western United States, the Sierra Nevada, California, and the Sangre de Cristo Range, Colorado. These areas exhibit a range of degrees of glacial occupation during the Quaternary, including some drainage basins essentially unoccupied by ice, allowing a detailed exploration of how relief in different parts of a drainage basin evolves in response to glacial modification. We mapped last glacial maximum (LGM) trimlines to estimate the ice thickness at the equilibrium line altitude during the LGM, and determined several metrics of relief for drainage basins across the full spectrum of LGM ice extents. Comparison between measures of relief and ice thickness estimates indicates that relief production in glaciated mountain belts scales with ice thickness and consequently also drainage area. We extended our study to the Bitterroot Range in Idaho/Montana, and the Teton Range in Wyoming, for a more comprehensive understanding of sub-ridgeline relief, or 'missing mass'. This measure of rnean relief is surprisingly little affected by either the degree of glacial modification or the total material removed by glaciers, but appears to be influenced by the more active tectonics of the Teton Range. While the effects of glacial modification on the landscape are clear (valley widening, hanging valley formation), the overall change in the relief structure of the mountain ranges studied here is surprisingly modest.

The results show that trends in ET in spring and summer are determined primarily by trends in precipitation and snowmelt that determine water availability. From April to June, ET trends are mostly positive due primarily to earlier snowmelt and earlier emergence of snow-free ground, and secondarily to increasing trends in spring precipitation. From July to September trends in ET are more strongly influenced by precipitation trends, with the exception of areas ( most notably California) that receive little summer precipitation and have experienced large changes in snowmelt timing. Trends in the seasonal timing of ET are modest, but during the period 1947 - 2003 when temperature trends are large, they reflect a shift of ET from midsummer to early summer and late spring. As in other studies, it is found that runoff is occurring earlier in spring, a trend that is related primarily to increasing temperature, and is most apparent during 1947 - 2003. Trends in the annual runoff ratio, a variable critical to western water management, are determined primarily by trends in cool season precipitation, rather than changes in the timing of runoff or ET. It was found that the signature of temperature- related trends in runoff and SM is strongly keyed to mean midwinter [ December - February ( DJF)] temperatures.

Outbreaks of mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) require life cycles of one year with synchronous emergence of adults from host trees at an appropriate time of year (termed ""adaptive seasonality'') to overwhelm tree defenses. The annual course of temperature plays a major role in governing life stage development and imposing synchrony on mountain pine beetle populations. Here we apply a process-based model of adaptive seasonality across the western United States using gridded daily temperatures from the Vegetation/Ecosystem Modeling and Analysis Project (VEMAP) over the period 1895-2100. Historical locations of modeled adaptive seasonality overlay much of the distribution of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Douglas), a favored host, indicating that suitable temperatures for outbreak occurred in areas of host availability. A range of suitable temperatures, both in the mean and over an annual cycle, resulted in adaptive seasonality. Adaptive seasonality typically occurred when mean annual temperatures were 3 degrees-6 degrees C, but also included locations where mean temperatures were as low as 1 degrees C or as high as 11 degrees C, primarily as a result of variability in winter temperatures. For most locations, years of adaptive seasonality were uncommon during 1895-1993. We analyzed historical temperatures and adaptive seasonality in more detail in three northern forest ecoprovinces. In the Northern and Middle Rockies, areas of adaptive seasonality decreased at lower elevations and increased at higher elevations during warmer periods, resulting in a movement upward in elevation of adaptive seasonality. In contrast, the Cascade Mountains exhibited overall declines in adaptive seasonality with higher temperatures regardless of elevation. Projections of future warming (5 degrees C in the western United States) resulted in substantial reductions in the overall area of adaptive seasonality. At the highest elevations, predicted warmer conditions will result in increases in the area of adaptive seasonality.

The area contains numerous national parks and protected areas with relatively pristine watersheds that permit analyses of historic streamflow patterns with minimal human impacts that would alter hydraulic linkages between precipitation and river discharge. Consequently, we analyzed patterns of mean annual discharge (Q(a)) from 31 river reaches that were generally free-flowing with hydrologic records typically commencing in the 1910s and extending to about 2002. To maximize the records of six rivers we undertook regression analyses to extrapolate Q(a) from sequential hydrometric gauges or from early, summer-only Q data. Spearman rho and Kendall tau b non-parametric correlations and a parametric approach involving linear regressions combined with analyses of variance were highly consistent in detecting significant historic trends in Q(a) and the regression analyses estimated the trend magnitudes. These analyses revealed flow declines (exceeding 0.1%/year over the historic record) for 21 reaches (5 with p<0.1, 10 with p<0.05), while 10 rivers displayed little change (<0.1%/year and not significant). Flow declines were prominent for the Alberta rivers, which flow to Hudson Bay and the Arctic Ocean, and also observed for some Pacific and Atlantic drainages. Overall, the rivers displayed a mean Q(a) reduction of 0.22%/year (median = -0.17%/year) and four rivers had recent decline rates exceeding 0.5%/year. The progressive decline was superimposed on an approximately half-century oscillation in streamflow that was strongly associated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. Following from the observed river flow decline over the past century, it is likely that there will be continuing decline in future decades; this prediction contrasts with many current climate change forecasts. Historic and continuing reductions in these streamflows will impact aquatic and riparian ecosystems and diminish water supplies for irrigation. industrial and domestic use, and hydroelectric power generation, with effects extending from these mountain headwaters downstream through other ecoregions.

There are many mechanisms for synchronizing developmental milestones, such as egg laying (oviposition), egg hatching, cocoon opening, and the emergence of adults. These are often irreversible, specific to particular life stages, and include diapause, an altered physiological state which can be reversed by some synchronizing environmental cue (e.g. photoperiod). However, many successful organisms display none of these mechanisms for maintaining adaptive seasonality. In this paper, we briefly review the mathematical relationship between environmental temperatures and developmental timing and discuss the consequences of viewing these models as circle maps from the cycle of yearly oviposition dates and temperatures to oviposition dates for subsequent generations. Of particular interest biologically are life cycles which are timed to complete in exactly 1 year, or univoltine cycles. Univoltinism, associated with reproductive success for many temperate species, is related to stable fixed points of the developmental circle map. Univoltine fixed points are stable and robust in broad temperature bands, but lose stability suddenly to maladaptive cycles at the edges of these bands. Adaptive seasonality may therefore break down with little warning with constantly increasing or decreasing temperature change, as in scenarios for global warming. These ideas are illustrated and explored in the context of Mountain Pine Beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) occurring in the marginal thermal habitat of central Idaho's Rocky Mountains. Applications of these techniques have not been widely explored by the applied math community, but are likely to provide great insight into the response of biological systems to climate change.

Precipitation anomalies during ENSO often show opposite and spatially coherent dry and wet patterns in the Northwest and California or vice versa. The role of orography in establishing mesoscale ENSO anomalies in the western United States is examined based on observed precipitation and temperature data at 1/8degrees spatial resolution and a regional climate simulation at 40-km spatial resolution. Results show that during El Nino or La Nina winters, strong precipitation anomalies are found in northern California, along the southern California coast, and in the northwest mountains such as the Olympic Mountains, the Cascades, and the northern Rockies. These spatial features, which are strongly affected by topography, are surprisingly well reproduced by the regional climate simulation. A spatial feature investigated further is the positive - negative - positive precipitation anomaly found during El Nino years in the Olympic Mountains, and on the west side and east side of the Cascades in both observations and regional simulation. Observed streamflows of river basins located in those areas are found to be consistent with the precipitation anomalies. The spatial distribution of the precipitation anomalies is investigated by relating flow direction and moisture to the orientation of mountains and orographic precipitation. On the west side of the north - south-oriented Cascade Range, the increase in atmospheric moisture is not enough to compensate for the loss of orographic precipitation associated with a change in flow direction toward the southwest during El Nino years. In California, both the increase in atmospheric moisture and shift in wind direction toward the southwest enhance precipitation along the Sierra, which is oriented northwest to southeast.

In order to allow for a detailed comparison of the estimated precipitation with observations, the simulated precipitation is taken from the NCEP-NCAR reanalysis, which nearly perfectly represents the historic pressure, temperature, and humidity, but calculates precipitation according to the model physics and parameterizations. Three statistical downscaling methods are investigated: (i) local rescaling of the simulated precipitation, and two newly developed methods, namely, (ii) downscaling using singular value decomposition (SVD) with simulated precipitation as the predictor, and (iii) local rescaling with a dynamical correction. Both local scaling methods are straightforward to apply to GCMs that are used for climate change experiments and seasonal forecasts, since they only need control runs for model fitting. The SVD method requires for model fitting special reanalysis-type GCM runs nudged toward observations from a historical period (selection of analogs from the GCM chosen to optimally match the historical weather states might achieve similar results). The precipitation-based methods are compared with conventional statistical downscaling using SVD with various large-scale predictors such as geopotential height, temperature, and humidity. The skill of the different methods for reconstructing historical wintertime precipitation (1958-94) over Oregon and Washington is tested on various spatial scales as small as 50 km and on temporal scales from months to decades. All methods using precipitation as a predictor perform considerably better than the conventional downscaling. The best results using conventional methods are obtained with geopotential height at 1000 hPa or humidity at 850 hPa as predictors. In these cases correlations of monthly observed and reconstructed precipitation on the 50-km scale range from 0.43 to 0.65. The inclusion of several predictor fields does not improve the reconstructions, since they are all highly correlated. Local rescaling of simulated precipitation yields much higher correlations between 0.7 and 0.9, with the exception of the rain shadow of the Cascade Mountains in the Columbia Basin (eastern Washington). When the simulated precipitation is used as a predictor in SVD-based downscaling correlations also reach 0.7 in eastern Washington. Dynamical correction improves the local scaling considerably in the rain shadow and yields correlations almost as high as with the SVD method.

Exhaustive search techniques were employed to determine the optimal set of precipitation and temperature stations, and the optimal set of WB model parameters to use for each basin. It was found that the WB model worked best for basins with: (1) a mean elevation less than 450 meters or greater than 2000 meters, and/or (2) monthly runoff that is greater than 5 millimeters (mm) more than 80 percent of the time.

The delta change method uses differences between simulated current and future climate conditions from the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research (HadCM2) General Circulation Model (GCM) added to observed time series of climate variables. A statistical downscaling (SDS) model was developed for each basin using station data and output from the National Center for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) reanalysis regridded to the scale of HadCM2.

Results from this study show that, in the basins tested, a precipitation-runoff model can simulate realistic runoff series for current conditions using statistically downscaled NCEP output. But, use of downscaled HadCM2 output for current or future climate assessments are questionable because the GCM does not produce accurate estimates of the surface variables needed for runoff in these regions.

This study uses dynamical downscaling with a regional climate model (RCM) driven by a GCM to simulate climate change scenarios. The RCM uses a subgrid parameterization of orographic precipitation and land surface cover to simulate surface climate at the spatial scale suitable for the representation of topographic effects over mountainous regions. Numerical experiments have been performed to simulate the present-day climatology and the climate conditions corresponding to a doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentration. The RCM results indicate an average warming of about 2.5 degrees C, and precipitation generally increases over the Pacific Northwest and decreases over California. These simulations were used to drive a distributed hydrology model of two snow dominated watersheds, the American River and Middle Fork Flathead, in the Pacific Northwest to obtain more detailed estimates of the sensitivity of water resources to climate change. Results show that as more precipitation falls as rain rather than snow in the warmer climate, there is a 60 percent reduction in snowpack and a significant shift in the seasonal pattern of streamflow in the American River. Much less drastic changes are found in the Middle Fork Flathead where snowpack is only reduced by 18 percent and the seasonal pattern of streamflow remains intact.

Nitrogen fertilization typically increases yields, but N-use efficiency is generally low. Neither the amount of fertilizer-N recovered by the forage nor the effect on N2O and CH4 emissions were known. These trace gases are long-lived in the atmosphere and contribute to global warming potential and stratospheric ozone depletion.

Plots were fertilized with 168 kg N ha(-1). Microplots labeled with N-15-fertilizer were established to trace the fate of the added N. Weekly fluxes of N2O and CH4 were measured during the snow-free periods of the year. Although CH4 was consumed when soils were drying, flood irrigation converted the meadow into a net source of CH4. Nitrogen fertilization did not affect CH4 flux but increased N2O emissions. About 5% of the applied N was lost as N2O from spring applied NH4NO3, far greater than the amount lost as N2O from urea or fall applied NH4NO3.

Specifically, the existing chronologies indicate that these glaciers were advancing to their terminal areas up to several thousand years before a Heinrich event and retreated shortly thereafter, Because midlatitude glaciers respond relatively rapidly to climate change, this complex record of glacial fluctuations suggests mechanisms of climate forcing in western North America that are in some way tied to Heinrich events, One possible mechanism involves southerly and northerly displacement of the jet stream across the western United States in response to growth and collapse of the Laurentide ice sheet.",1995,Geology,Article,NA,web_of_science,Yes,,,,,,

This paper reports on the probable effects of a temperature increase and changes in transpiration on basin discharge in two different mountain snowmelt regions of the western United States. The hydrological effects of the climate changes are modeled with a relatively simple conceptual, semi-distributed snowmelt runoff model. Based on the model results, it may be concluded that increased air temperatures will result in a shift of snowmelt runoff to earlier in the snowmelt season. Furthermore, it is shown that it is very important to include the expected change in climate-related basin conditions resulting from the modeled temperature increase in the runoff simulation. The effect of adapting the model parameters to reflect the changed basin conditions resulted in a further shift of streamflow to April and an even more significant decrease of snowmelt runoff in June and July. If the air temperatures increase by approximately 5-degrees-C and precipitation and accumulated snow amounts remain about the same, runoff in April and May, averaged for the two basins, is expected to increase by 185 percent and 25 percent, respectively. The runoff in June and July will decrease by about 60 percent each month. Overall, the total seasonal runoff decreases by about 6 percent. If increased CO2 concentrations further change basin conditions by reducing transpiration by the maximum amounts reported in the literature, then, combined with the 5-degrees-C temperature increase, the April, May, June, and July changes would average +230 percent, +40 percent, -55 percent, and -45 percent, respectively.

Generally, there is some consistency among computer models of global climate that surface temperatures will increase and that, in many areas, precipitation and evaporation also may increase. However, determining the effects of such changes on the distribution and circulation of water at the land surface, and on water management systems, remains problematic. The American River, Washington, a mountainous tributary of the Yakima River, is typical of rivers in the Columbia Basin states of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and western Montana, as well as southern British Columbia. Using the American River as a case study, this investigation developed computer models to simulate and identify water management conflicts that might arise in this region under a general climate warming of both 2-degrees-C and 4-degrees-C. For warmer climates, it was found that snow accumulation would be substantially reduced, and the river's high flow season would shift from the spring to the winter. Potential evaporation would increase throughout the year (mostly in the summer), but peak actual evaporation would shift to the late spring and early summer, due to reduced summer soil moisture. The effect of the streamflow pattern that would accompany a warmer climate was tested on small and moderate sized hypothetical multi-purpose reservoirs. The results showed that water supply reliability would be significantly degraded by the earlier spring runoff pattern that would accompany a warmer climate, especially for small reservoirs. The result was that hydroelectric revenues might increase due to larger reservoir releases needed during the winter peak demand season. An investigation of alternative operating policies for the reservoir system showed that more efficient reservoir operation alone would not mitigate the degraded reliability of water supply that would accompany a warmer climate.",1992,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,Article,NA,web_of_science,Yes,,,,,,

MethodsWe surveyed non-native plant species along three mountain roads and into the native habitat matrix to assess the extent of invasion success along distance from roadside and elevation gradients. We used GLM to predict single species occurrence probabilities, LMM to examine differences in distribution patterns among functional types, and pCCA to examine multivariate responses of the non-native community to ecological variables. ResultsProbability of occurrence of the eight focal invasive species was not significantly related to distance from the road, but declined with elevation. Non-native species with annual life history strategies were more restricted to lower elevations than perennial species. Non-native species considered invasive occurred at lower minimum elevations than naturalized species. Shifts in the species composition of the non-native plant community were related to changes in soil and climate variables. ConclusionsOur results suggest that invasive species have similar patterns of habitat associations and spread from roadsides to interior vegetation zones, whereas naturalized species partition environmental gradients in this semi-arid montane ecosystem. Furthermore, annual and invasive species groups occupy lower elevations and perennial and naturalized species groups have invaded further up the mountain roads and into the native vegetation.

Through deposit sedimentology and C-14 dating of charcoal, we evaluate the processes and timing of fire-related sedimentation and the role of climate and vegetation change. Fire-related deposits compose similar to 66% of the total measured fan deposit thickness in more densely forested upper basins versus similar to 33% in shrub-steppe-dominated lower basins. Fires during the middle Holocene (similar to 8000-5000 cal. yr BP) mostly resulted in sheetflood deposition, similar to modern events in lower basins. Decreased vegetation density during this generally warmer and drier period likely resulted in lower-severity fires and more frequent but smaller fire-related sedimentation events. In contrast, thick fire-related debris-flow deposits of latest Pleistocene-early Holocene (similar to 13,500-8000 cal. yr BP) and late Holocene (<4000 cal. yr BP) age are inferred to represent higher-severity fires, although data in the former period are limited.

Following deglaciation, the landscape surrounding Dailey Lake was sparsely vegetated, and erosional input into the lake was high. As summer insolation increased and ice recessional processes subsided, Picea parkland developed and diatoms established in the lake at 13,300 cal yr BP. Closed subalpine forests of Picea, Abies, and Pinus established at 12,300 cal yr BP followed by the development of open Pinus and Pseudotsuga forests at 10,200 cal yr BP. Increased planktic diatom abundance indicates a step-like warming at 13,100 cal yr BP, and alternations between planktic and tychoplankic taxa suggest changes in lake thermal structure between 12,400 and 11,400 cal yr BP. An increasingly open forest, in combination with increased benthic diatoms, indicates warm dry summers during the early Holocene after 11,400 cal yr BP, in contrast to nearby records in northern Yellowstone that register prolonged summer-wet conditions until ca. 8000 cal yr BP. Because of its low elevation, Dailey Lake was apparently sensitive to the direct effects of increased summer insolation on temperature and effective moisture, registering dry summers. In contrast, higher elevations in northern Yellowstone responded to the indirect effects of an amplified seasonal insolation cycle on atmospheric circulation, including elevated winter snowpack and/or increased summer convective storms as a result of enhanced monsoonal circulation.

Watersheds dominated by basalt and flatter landscapes exhibited the smallest recession time scales (K) (12.5-20.0 days). Greater K values (33.3-66.7 days) were obtained over catchments dominated by metamorphic and sedimentary rocks. Mean basin slope and the aridity index were found to be the best estimators of baseflow coefficients. Baseflow in flat basalt landscapes, located in dry warm climates, decrease rapidly during summer months and are most sensitive to future droughts and warming climates. Groundwater systems feeding streams during the driest months can drop to less than 1 mm of effective storage in these sensitive systems. In contrast, the minimum annual storage in mountainous systems can have greater than 10 mm effective storage.

These mandates target possible adaptation and mitigation strategies. However, the degree to which climate change is actively being considered in agency planning and management decisions is largely unknown. We explored the usefulness of climate change science for federal resource managers, focusing on the efficacy of potential adaptation strategies and barriers limiting the use of climate change science in adaptation efforts. Our study was conducted in the northern Rocky Mountains region of the western United States, where we interacted with 77 U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management personnel through surveys, semistructured interviews, and four collaborative workshops at locations across Idaho and Montana. We used a mixed-methods approach to evaluate managers' perceptions about adapting to and mitigating for climate change. Although resource managers incorporate general language about climate change in regional and landscape-level planning documents, they are currently not planning on-the-ground adaptation or mitigation projects. However, managers felt that their organizations were most likely to adapt to climate change through use of existing management strategies that are already widely implemented for other non climate-related management goals. These existing strategies, (e.g., thinning and prescribed burning) are perceived as more feasible than new climate-specific methods (e.g., assisted migration) because they already have public and agency support, accomplish multiple goals, and require less anticipation of the future timing and probability of climate change impacts.

During an intense rainstorm in November 2006, seven debris flows initiated from proglacial gullies of separate basins on the flanks of Mount Rainier. Gully heads at glacier termini and widespread failure of gully walls imply that overland flow was transformed into debris flow along gullies. We characterized gully change and morphology, and assessed spatial distributions of debris flows to infer the processes and conditions for debris flow initiation. Slopes at gully heads were greater than similar to 0.35 m m(-1) (19 degrees) and exhibited a significant negative relationship with drainage area. A break in slope-drainage area trends among debris flow gullies also occurs at similar to 0.35 m m(-1), representing a possible transition to fluvial sediment transport and erosion. An interpreted hybrid model of debris flow initiation involves bed failure near gully heads followed by sediment recruitment from gully walls along gully lengths. Estimates of sediment volume loss from gully walls demonstrate the importance of sediment inputs along gullies for increasing debris flow volumes. Basin comparisons revealed significantly steeper drainage networks and higher elevations in debris flow-producing than non-debris flow-producing proglacial areas. The high slopes and elevations of debris flow-producing proglacial areas reflect positive slope-elevation trends for the Mount Rainier volcano. Glacier extent therefore controls the slope distribution in proglacial areas, and thus potential for debris flow generation. As a result, debris flow activity may increase as glacier termini retreat onto slopes inclined at angles above debris flow initiation thresholds. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The relative importance of behavioral responses to climate-induced variation in costs vs. supplies of energy, however, is uncertain, as is the degree to which such responses are mediated by current stores of energy. We evaluated relationships among behavior, nutritional condition (i.e., energy state), and spatiotemporal variation in costs vs. supplies of energy available to a large-bodied endotherm, the North American elk (Cervus elaphus), occupying two ecosystems with contrasting climates and energy landscapes: a temperate, montane forest and an arid, high-elevation desert. We hypothesized that during spring through autumn, behavioral responses to the energy landscape would be both context dependent (i.e., would vary as a function of the contrasting environmental conditions experienced by elk in the forest vs. the desert), and state dependent (i.e., would vary as a function of the energy balance of an individual). We tested several predictions derived from that hypothesis by combining output from a biophysical model of the thermal environment with data on forage quality, animal locations, and nutritional condition of individuals. At the population level, elk in the desert selected areas that reduced costs of thermoregulation over those that provided the highest-quality forage. In the forest, however, costs imposed by the thermal environment were less pronounced, and elk selected areas that increased access to high-quality forage over those that reduced costs of thermoregulation. At the individual level, nutritional condition did not influence strength of selection for low-cost areas or high-quality forage among elk in the forest. In the desert, however, strength of selection for low-cost areas (but not forage quality) was state dependent; individuals in the poorest condition at the end of winter showed the strongest selection for areas that reduced costs of thermoregulation during spring and summer, and also expended the least amount of energy on locomotion.

One of many assumptions of these approaches is that food web dependencies are consistent in time and environmental space. Species at higher trophic levels that rely on the availability of species at lower trophic levels as food may be sensitive to extinction cascades initiated by changes in the habitat of key food resources. Here we assess climate change vulnerability for Ursus arctos (grizzly bears) in the southern Canadian Rocky Mountains using projected changes to 17 of the most commonly consumed plant food items. We used presence-absence information from 7088 field plots to estimate ecological niches and to project changes in future distributions of each species. Model projections indicated idiosyncratic responses among food items. Many food items persisted or even increased, although several species were found to be vulnerable based on declines or geographic shifts in suitable habitat. These included Hedysarum alpinum (alpine sweet vetch), a critical spring and autumn root-digging resource when little else is available. Potential habitat loss was also identified for three fruiting species of lower importance to bears: Empetrum nigrum (crowberry), Vaccinium scoparium (grouseberry), and Fragaria virginiana (strawberry). A general trend towards uphill migration of bear foods may result in higher vulnerability to bear populations at low elevations, which are also those that are most likely to have human-bear conflict problems. Regardless, a wide diet breadth of grizzly bears, as well as wide environmental niches of most food items, make climate change a much lower threat to grizzly bears than other bear species such as polar bears and panda bears.

Streams and rivers in the U.S. Rocky Mountains have been warming for several decades. At the same time these systems have been experiencing an increase in the severity and frequency of wildfires, which often results in habitat changes including increased water temperatures. We resampled 74 sites across a Rocky Mountain watershed 17 to 20 years after initial samples to determine whether there were trends in bull trout occurrence associated with temperature, wildfire, or other habitat variables. We found that site abandonment probabilities (0.36) were significantly higher than colonization probabilities (0.13), which indicated a reduction in the number of occupied sites. Site abandonment probabilities were greater at low elevations with warm temperatures. Other covariates, such as the presence of wildfire, nonnative brook trout, proximity to areas with many adults, and various stream habitat descriptors, were not associated with changes in probability of occupancy. Higher abandonment probabilities at low elevation for bull trout provide initial evidence validating the predictions made by bioclimatic models that bull trout populations will retreat to higher, cooler thermal refuges as water temperatures increase.

Here we demonstrate the use of a hydrologic landscape (HL) approach to evaluate vulnerability to potential future climate change at statewide and basin scales in the state of Oregon. The HL classification has five components: climate, seasonality, aquifer permeability, terrain, and soil permeability. We evaluate changes when the 1971-2000 HL climate indices are recalculated using 2041-2070 simulation results from the ECHAM (European Centre HAMburg) and PCM (Parallel Climate Model) climate models with the A2, A1b, and B1 emission scenarios. Changes in climate class were modest (4-18%) statewide. However, there were major changes in seasonality class for five of the six realizations (excluding PCM_B1): Oregon shifts from being 13% snow-dominated to 4-6% snow-dominated under these five realizations, representing a 56-68% reduction in snowmelt-dominated area. At the basin scale, simulated changes for the Siletz Basin, in Oregon's Coast Range, include a small switch from very wet to wet climate, with no change in seasonality. However, there is a modest increase in fall and winter water due to increased precipitation. For the Sandy Basin, on the western slope of the Cascades, HL climate class does not change, but there are major changes in seasonality, especially for areas with low aquifer permeability, which experiences a 100% loss of spring seasonality. This would reduce summer baseflow, but effects could potentially be mitigated by streamflow buffering effects provided by groundwater in the high aquifer permeability portions of the upper Sandy. The Middle Fork John Day Basin (MFJD), in northeastern Oregon, is snowmelt-dominated. The basin experiences a net loss of wet and moist climate area, along with an increase in dry climate area. The MFJD also experiences major shifts from spring to winter seasonality, representing a 20-60% reduction in snowmelt-dominated area. Altered seasonality and/or magnitude of seasonal streamflows could potentially affect survival, growth and reproduction of salmonids in these watersheds, with the greatest effects projected for the MFJD. A major strength of the HL approach is that results can be applied to similarly classified, ungaged basins.

Various stakeholders may be interested in different sets of these variables. It is found that temperature and the fraction of winter precipitation that falls as snow exhibit significant trends first, followed in 5-10 years by the fraction of cold-season precipitation retained in the spring snowpack, and later still by the water content of the spring snowpack. Change in total cold-season snowfall is least detectable of all the measures, since it is strongly linked to precipitation, which has large natural variability and only a weak anthropogenic trend in the western United States.

For these models, empirical relationships between elevation and air temperature are frequently used to upscale point measurements or downscale regional and global climate model estimates of air temperature. Mountainous environments are particularly sensitive to air temperature estimates as spatial gradients are substantial, and air temperature plays a critical role in snow-related processes. We use a distributed, coupled ecohydrologic model to compare estimates of streamflow, snowmelt, transpiration, and net primary productivity (NPP) using five temperature interpolation approaches for a forested mountain basin that is dominated by a rain-snow zone in Western Oregon, USA. We compare model estimates using a standard adiabatic lapse rate of -6.5 degrees C km(-1); basin-specific lapse rates created using daily point observations at high, middle, and low elevations; and gridded temperature estimates from the Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) derived at 800 and 50 m resolutions. We show that temperature interpolation strategies influence model calibration. Point-based estimates using a low-elevation station or 800 m PRISM grids result in significantly fewer parameter sets that model streamflow well, suggesting a bias in parameter selection due to errors in input data. The greatest postcalibration impact of temperature lapse rate estimates occurs for model estimates of NPP. The constant temperature lapse rate results in substantially reduced NPP estimates that are more sensitive to the interannual variation in climate forcing. Citation: Garcia, E. S., C. L.

Descriptions of snowpack decline often use linear ordinary least squares (OLS) models to quantify this change. However, the region's precipitation is known to be related to climate cycles. If snowpack decline is more closely related to these cycles, an OLS model cannot account for this effect, and thus both descriptions of trends and estimates of decline could be inaccurate. We used intervention analysis to determine whether snow water equivalent (SWE) in 25 long-term snow courses within the Olympic and Cascade Mountains are more accurately described by OLS (to represent gradual change), stationary (to represent no change), or step-stationary (to represent climate cycling) models. We used Bayesian information-theoretic methods to determine these models' relative likelihood, and we found 90 models that could plausibly describe the statistical structure of the 25 snow courses' time series. Posterior model probabilities of the 29 ""most plausible"" models ranged from 0.33 to 0.91 (mean = 0.58, s = 0.15). The majority of these time series (55 %) were best represented as step-stationary models with a single breakpoint at 1976/77, coinciding with a major shift in the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. However, estimates of SWE decline differed by as much as 35 % between statistically plausible models of a single time series. This ambiguity is a critical problem for water management policy.

Yet, forest C density varies greatly in space, both globally and at stand and landscape levels. Understanding the multi-scale drivers of this variation is a prerequisite for robust and effective climate change mitigation in ecosystem management. Here, we used airborne light detection and ranging (Lidar) and a novel high-resolution simulation model of landscape dynamics (iLand) to identify the drivers of variation in C density for an old-growth forest landscape in Oregon, USA. With total ecosystem C in excess of 1 Gt ha(-1) these ecosystems are among the most C-rich globally. Our findings revealed considerable spatial variability in stand-level C density across the landscape. Notwithstanding the distinct environmental gradients in our mountainous study area only 55.3% of this variation was explained by environmental drivers, with radiation and soil physical properties having a stronger influence than temperature and precipitation. The remaining variation in C stocks was largely attributable to emerging properties of stand dynamics (that is, stand structure and composition). Not only were density- and size-related indicators positively associated with C stocks but also diversity in composition and structure, documenting a close link between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. We conclude that the complexity of old-growth forests contributes to their sustained high C levels, a finding that is relevant to managing forests for climate change mitigation.",2012,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Article,forest carbon storage; old-growth forests; climate change mitigation; ecosystem structure and functioning; functional diversity; forest stand dynamics; airborne Lidar; individual-based modeling; iLand,web_of_science,Yes,,,,,,

There is strong evidence that climate change has contributed to the extent and severity of recent outbreaks. Scientists are interested in quantifying relationships between bark beetle population dynamics and trends in climate. Process models that simulate climate suitability for mountain pine beetle outbreaks have advanced our understanding of beetle population dynamics; however, there are few studies that have assessed their accuracy across multiple outbreaks or at larger spatial scales. This study used the observed number of trees killed by mountain pine beetles per square kilometer in Oregon and Washington, USA, over the past three decades to quantify and assess the influence of climate and weather variables on beetle activity over longer time periods and larger scales than previously studied. Influences of temperature and precipitation in addition to process model output variables were assessed at annual and climatological time scales. The statistical analysis showed that new attacks are more likely to occur at locations with climatological mean August temperatures >15 degrees C. After controlling for beetle pressure, the variables with the largest effect on the odds of an outbreak exceeding a certain size were minimum winter temperature (positive relationship) and drought conditions in current and previous years. Precipitation levels in the year prior to the outbreak had a positive effect, possibly an indication of the influence of this driver on brood size. Two-year cumulative precipitation had a negative effect, a possible indication of the influence of drought on tree stress. Among the process model variables, cold tolerance was the strongest indicator of an outbreak increasing to epidemic size. A weather suitability index developed from the regression analysis indicated a 2.5x increase in the odds of outbreak at locations with highly suitable weather vs. locations with low suitability. The models were useful for estimating expected amounts of damage (total area with outbreaks) and for quantifying the contribution of climate to total damage. Overall, the results confirm the importance of climate and weather on the spatial expansion of bark beetle outbreaks over time.",2012,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Article,adaptive seasonality; aerial detection survey data; climate suitability; Dendroctonus ponderosae; logistic regression; mountain pine beetle; multinomial probabilities; spatial regression; spline functions,web_of_science,Yes,,,,,,

However, variability in such projections for the future periods, particularly the variability arising from uncertain future climates, remains a critical challenge for incorporating these projections into climate change adaptation strategies. We combined the use of a robust statistical modeling technique with a simple consensus approach consolidating projected outcomes for multiple climate change scenarios, and exemplify how the results could guide reforestation planning. Random Forest (RF) was used to model relationships between climate (1961-1990), described by 44 variables, and the geographic distribution of 16 major ecosystem types in British Columbia (BC), Canada. The model predicted current ecosystem distributions with high accuracy (mismatch rate = 4-16% for most ecosystem classes). It was then used to predict the distribution of ecosystem climate niches for the last decade (2001-2009) and project future distributions for 20 climate change scenarios. We found that geographic distributions of the suitable climate habitats for BC ecosystems have already shifted in 23% of BC since the 1970s. Consensus projections for future periods (2020s, 2050s, 2080s) indicated climates suitable for grasslands, dry forests, and moist continental cedar-hemlock forests would substantially expand; climate habitat for coastal rainforests would remain relatively stable; and habitat for boreal, subalpine and alpine ecosystems would decrease substantially. Using these consensus projections and data on the occurrence of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii [Mirb.] Franco) in BC ecosystems, we estimated a twofold increase in seedling demand for this frost-sensitive, commercially important timber species, suggesting managers could begin planning to expand seed inventories and seed orchard capacity to more widely plant this species on logged sites. The results of this work demonstrate the power of RF for building climate envelope models and illustrate the utility of consensus projections for incorporating uncertainty about future climate into management planning. It also emphasizes the immediate need for adapting natural resource management to a changing climate. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Data for this study came from a study established in 1988 that includes 31 research installations located between the Pacific Coast and the Cascade Mountains in Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia. The growth-climate model developed includes: summer heat moisture index (SHM), mean warmest month temperature (MWMT), spring precipitation (PPTsp), and initial height; and captures 78% of the variation in red alder volume increment. Based on this model, estimates of potential future growth were generated for three climate scenarios (i.e., cccma_cgcm3_A2-run4 'warm and wet' of the Canadian Centre for Climate Modeling and Analysis; and ukmo_hadcm3_B1-run1 'cool and moist' and ukmo_HadGEM1_A1B-run1 'hot and dry' of the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research). These projections indicate a potential increase in volume increment of up-to 12% by the 2080s. Range-wide maps were generated for the volume increment potential (VIP) for the reference normal period 1961-1990, for the 'warm and wet' climate scenario, and the 2050s time period, suggesting that climate change may cause a substantial shift in the range and productivity of red alder in the PNW. In addition, maps of the predicted VIP of red alder for the Campbell River District in BC were generated and indicate an overall increase in projected growth of red alder. This study provides evidence that climate change will likely lead to expansion of the range and potential increases in growth for red alder in conjunction with assisted migration of provenance in the PNW. While these results indicate potential increased opportunities for extension of the range of red alder and opportunities for its management, care must be taken to avoid planting alder on sites with high risk of damaging agents such as cold outflow winds, frost, or drought.

Many studies have shown that insect species respond rapidly to climatic change. A mountain pine beetle epidemic of record size in North America has led to unprecedented mortality of lodgepole pine, and a significant range expansion to the northeast of its historic range. Our goal was to determine the spatial genetic variation found among outbreak population from which genetic structure, and dispersal patterns may be inferred. Beetles from 49 sampling locations throughout the outbreak area in western Canada were analysed at 13 microsatellite loci. We found significant north-south population structure as evidenced by: (i) Bayesian-based analyses, (ii) north-south genetic relationships and diversity gradients; and (iii) a lack of isolation-by-distance in the northernmost cluster. The north-south structure is proposed to have arisen from the processes of postglacial colonization as well as recent climate-driven changes in population dynamics. Our data support the hypothesis of multiple sources of origin for the outbreak and point to the need for population specific information to improve our understanding and management of outbreaks. The recent range expansion across the Rocky Mountains into the jack/lodgepole hybrid and pure jack pine zones of northern Alberta is consistent with a northern British Columbia origin.

Rising air temperature will reduce winter snowfall and increase earlier snowmelt, subsequently reducing summer flows. Longer crop-growing season caused by higher temperatures will lead to increases in evapotranspiration and irrigation water demand, which could exacerbate drought damage. However, the impacts of climate change on drought risk will vary over space and time. Thus, spatially explicit drought assessment can help water resource managers and planners to better cope with risk. This study seeks to identify possible drought-vulnerable regions in the Willamette River Basin of the PNW. In order to estimate drought risk in a spatially explicit way, relative Standardized Precipitation Index (rSPI) and relative Standardized Runoff Index (rSRI) were employed. Statistically downscaled climate simulations forcing two greenhouse gas emission scenarios, A1B and B1, were used to investigate the possible changes in drought frequency with 3-, 6-, 12-, and 24-month time scales. The results of rSPI and rSRI showed an increase in the short-term frequency of drought due to decreases in summer precipitation and snowmelt. However, long-term drought showed no change or a slight decreasing pattern due to increases in winter precipitation and runoff. According to the local index of spatial autocorrelation analysis, the Willamette Valley region was more vulnerable (hot spot) to drought risk than the mountainous regions of the Western Cascades and the High Cascades (cold spot). Although the hydrology of the Western Cascades and the High Cascades will be affected by climate change, these regions will remain relatively water-rich. This suggests that improving the water transfer system could be a reasonable climate adaptation option. Additionally, these results showed that the spatial patterns of drought risk change were affected by drought indices, such that appropriate drought index selection will be important in future studies of climate impacts on spatial drought risk.",2012,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Article,NA,web_of_science,Yes,,,,,,

The objective of this study was to determine the relative importance of stand structure, topography, soil characteristics, landscape context (the characteristics of the landscape surrounding the focal stand) and beetle pressure (the abundance of local beetle population eruptions around the focal stand a few years before the outbreak) to explain landscape patterns of tree mortality during outbreaks of three species: the mountain pine beetle, which attacks lodgepole pine and whitebark pine; the spruce beetle, which feeds on Engelmann spruce; and the Douglas-fir beetle, which attacks Douglas-fir. A second objective was to identify common variables that explain tree mortality among beetletree host pairings during outbreaks. Location Greater Yellowstone ecosystem, Wyoming, USA. Methods We used field surveys to quantify stand structure, soil characteristics and topography at the plot level in susceptible stands of each forest type showing different severities of infestation (0-98% mortality; n = 129 plots). We then used forest cover and beetle infestation maps derived from remote sensing to develop landscape context and beetle pressure metrics at different spatial scales. Plot-level and landscape-level variables were used to explain outbreak severity. Results Engelmann spruce and Douglas-fir mortality were best predicted using landscape-level variables alone.

We evaluate the influences of five potential future temperature scenarios involving different degrees of warming. We use resistant kernel dispersal models to assess population connectivity based on full occupancy of suitable habitat in each of these hypothetical future resistance layers. We use the CDPOP model to simulate gene exchange among individual martens in each of these hypothetical future climates. We evaluate: (1) changes in the extent, connectivity and pattern of marten habitat, (2) changes in allelic richness and expected heterozygosity, and (3) changes in the range of significant positive genetic correlation within the northern Idaho marten population under each future scenario. We found that even moderate warming scenarios resulted in very large reductions in population connectivity. Calculation of genetic correlograms for each scenario indicates that climate driven changes in landscape connectivity results in decreasing range of genetic correlation, indicating more isolated and smaller genetic neighborhoods. These, in turn, resulted in substantial loss of allelic richness and reductions in expected heterozygosity. In the U. S. northern Rocky Mountains, climate change may extensively fragment marten populations to a degree that strongly reduces genetic diversity.

With riparian (floodplain) trees, river cut-banks provide natural hydraulic excavation of root systems and this presents a unique study opportunity. Subsequently, we developed the 'Cut-bank Root Method', a simple, quantitative approach for analyzing the distribution of coarse roots, based on analyses of photographs of river cut-banks. These reveal the vertical extent of roots and median root depths (R-d). We applied this method along six rivers draining the Canadian Rocky Mountains and observed tenfold difference in R-d. The floodplain forests were dominated by cottonwoods and from mountain to prairie zones we observed progressively deeper roots of Populus trichocarpa (black cottonwood, R-d similar to 0.3 m), P. balsamifera (balsam poplar), P. angustifolia (narrowleaf cottonwood), and P. deltoides (prairie cottonwood, R-d similar to 0.9 m), which had Rd similar to P. fremontii (Fremont cottonwood) in Nevada, USA. Roots were shallower for co-occurring facultative riparian trees, with R-d similar to 0.1 m for P. tremuloides (trembling aspen) and Picea glauca (white spruce). Across the Canadian sites, Rd for cottonwoods were strongly associated with a growth season moisture index (May through September precipitation-potential evapotranspiration; R-2 = 0.97, P < 0.001). Thus, in wetter climates, riparian cottonwoods were shallow-rooted and would be more dependent upon rain than stream flow. Conversely, in the drier semi-arid regions the cottonwoods were phreatophytic, with deeper root systems in the capillary fringe above the alluvial ground-water table. These phreatophytic cottonwoods would be highly dependent upon stream flow and vulnerable to declining river flows due to river regulation or climate change.",2011,Forestry,Article,Climate; Floodplain forests; Image analysis; Poplars; Populus; Precipitation; Spruce; Water relations,web_of_science,Yes,,,,,,

Watersheds with >50% of their area in the seasonal snow zone had significant (alpha <= 0.1) trends towards greater winter and lower summer discharge, while lower elevations had no consistent trends. In seasonal snow-dominated watersheds, runoff occurs 22-27 days earlier and minimum flows are 5-9% lower than in 1962, based on Sen's slope over the period. Trends in peak streamflow depend on whether watershed area susceptible to rain-on-snow events is increasing or decreasing.

Simultaneously, a Dothistroma needle blight epidemic in northwest BC has been responsible for killing thousands of hectares of pine plantations and has even resulted in the death of mature trees, which is unprecedented. Both of these globally significant forest pest epidemics have been linked to climate change. The beetle epidemic has grossly exceeded the scale of all previously recorded outbreaks, in large part due to a lack of cold winters. In this sense, the link to global warming is relatively straightforward and foreseeable. Of all climate change projections, the prediction of an increase in winter temperatures has been associated with as high a degree of confidence as any. The Dothistroma needle blight epidemic and its link to climate change were not so predictable. Based on weather records over the past four decades, short-term increases in mean summer precipitation correlate closely with historical records of Dothistroma outbreaks in the northwest. The current most severe outbreak has occurred during a prolonged period of above-average summer precipitation. An increase in summer precipitation would more typically be thought of as beneficial for forests, but that increase in moisture has improved the conditions for a pathogen that has outweighed any benefits. Similar trends of increasing incidence and severity for other forest pathogens in BC appear in areas that have been receiving increased summer precipitation. Conversely, in the southern interior of the province decreased summer precipitation and increased drought conditions are resulting in stressed trees which can favour root diseases. Early indications are that climate change will have profound effects on forest health.

I investigated (1) whether this difference in elevational limits has a genetic basis, (2) the importance of clinal genetic differentiation and phenotypic plasticity in phenology as responses to elevation in L. serriola, and whether these responses differ between regions, and (3) whether the realized temperature niche of L. serriola differs between the two regions. Location Plant material was collected in Canton Valais, Switzerland (native range) and the Wallowa Mountains, Oregon, USA (introduced range). The field experiment was conducted in Canton Grisons, Switzerland. Methods Plants from 20 populations collected along elevational gradients were grown in eight common gardens established at 200-m elevational intervals (600-2000 m a.s.l.). The timing of phenological transitions was monitored and analysed with mixed-effects models to determine differences in (1) elevational limits, and (2) clinal genetic differentiation and phenotypic plasticity as responses to elevation for plants from each region. The limits of the species along five temperature gradients were derived from generalized linear models using published occurrence data to quantify regional differences in the realized temperature niche. Results The limit of seed set (1400 m a.s.l.) was the same for plants of both regions. However, the limit of flowering, probably a better reflection of elevational limits in this study, was 400 m higher for plants from the introduced region due to their faster development. Native populations showed clines in development time with elevation consistent with expectations. However, these were weaker in introduced populations, the responses of which were rather characterized by phenotypic plasticity. Thus, although introduced populations grow at considerably cooler sites than in the native region, this is unlikely to have resulted from direct selection for tolerance of high-elevation conditions.

This is accomplished using two idealized, physically based models of mountain snowfall to simulate snowpack accumulation for the Cascade Mountains under current and warmed climates. Both models are forced from sounding observations. The first model uses the linear theory (LT) model of orographic precipitation to predict precipitation as a function of the incoming flow characteristics and uses the sounding temperatures to estimate the elevation of the rain-snow boundary, called the melting level (ML). The second ""ML model'' uses only the ML from the sounding and assumptions of uniform and constant precipitation. Both models simulate increases in precipitation intensity and elevated storm MLs under climate warming. The LT model predicts a 14.8%-18.1% loss of Cascade snowfall per degree of warming, depending on the vertical structure of the warming. The loss of snowfall is significantly greater, 19.4%-22.6%, if precipitation increases are neglected. Comparing the two models shows that the predominant control on lS is the relationship between the distribution of storm MLs and the distribution of topographic area with elevation. Although increases in precipitation due to warming may act to moderate lambda(S), the loss of snow accumulation area profoundly limits the ability of precipitation increases to maintain the snowpack under substantial climate warming (beyond 1 degrees-2 degrees C).

To determine the distribution of major mtDNA lineages, we conducted a phylogenetic analysis on the mtDNA sequence data, and we calculated divergence times among the lineages using a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo approach. Relationships among nuclear alleles were explored with minimum spanning networks. Finally, we conducted coalescent simulations of alternative models of population history to test for congruence between nDNA and mtDNA responses to Pleistocene glacial cycles. Results We found that: (1) all individuals could be assigned to one of five allopatric mtDNA lineages; (2) lineages are associated with separate mountain provinces; (3) lineages originated from at least two rounds of differentiation; (4) nDNA and mtDNA markers exhibited overall phylogeographic congruence; and (5) introgression among phylogroups has occurred at nuclear loci since their initial isolation. Main conclusions Pika populations associated with different mountain systems have followed separate but not completely independent evolutionary trajectories through multiple glacial cycles. Range expansion associated with climate cooling (i.e. glaciations) promoted genetic admixture among populations within mountain ranges. It also permitted periodic contact and introgression between phylogroups associated with different mountain systems, the record of which is retained at nDNA but not mtDNA loci. Evidence for different histories at nuclear and mtDNA loci (i.e. periodic introgression versus deep isolation, respectively) emphasizes the importance of multilocus perspectives for reconstructing complete population histories.",2010,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Physical Geography,Review,Alpine; coalescent simulation; glaciation; Lagomorpha; Ochotona princeps; Pleistocene; Rocky Mountains; Sierra Nevada; statistical phylogeography,web_of_science,Yes,,,,,,

Long-term (1971-2000) averages of observed temperature and precipitation, and sunshine data were used to calculate AE and PE. A cluster analysis identifies regions with similar annual cycles of AE/PE. We identify three different spatial scales of variability in AE/PE: (1) broadscale patterns reflect the trade-off between winter-dominated precipitation of the Pacific Northwest and summer-dominated precipitation east of the Rocky Mountains, and the south-to-north decrease in PE related to latitudinal variations in net radiation; (2) mesoscale patterns show the influence of regional-scale features (e. g., the North American Monsoon); and (3) local-scale patterns are related to topography. Understanding the scales of effective-moisture variations is valuable from the perspective of terrestrial ecosystems and water resources management in the mostly arid western United States.

Water managers are challenged by uncertainties concerning how climate variability and change interact with water supply at the regional level. This study aims to increase predictive capacity in one of the largest river systems in the Western United States, the Snake River, by identifying key atmosphere-ocean controls on streamflow and assessing how projected climate changes will translate into future water supply in the river. In contrast to previous research suggesting the Snake headwaters are in an area of weak teleconnection influence, the results of this study indicate that the region exhibits a response to El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) that is similar to the Pacific Northwest and strongly modulated by northern Pacific conditions. Although current projections of how dynamic features like ENSO might respond to climate change are highly uncertain, the lagged nature of the relationship between Pacific Ocean conditions and streamflow will be useful for near-term planning. The region was found to be sensitive to shifts in the winter westerly storm track system, with extreme low-flow years associated with a north-shifted storm track. Precipitation increases have been projected for the region, but other predicted consequences of climate change-including a poleward shift in storm track position, changing seasonality, and reduced snowpack-suggest an increased likelihood of future drought conditions.",2010,Geography,Article,climate change; drought; Snake River; teleconnections; water resources,web_of_science,Yes,,,,,,

We demonstrate that wild. re area burned (WFAB) in the American West was controlled by climate during the 20th century (1916-2003). Persistent ecosystem-specific correlations between climate and WFAB are grouped by vegetation type (ecoprovinces). Most mountainous ecoprovinces exhibit strong year-of-fire relationships with low precipitation, low Palmer drought severity index (PDSI), and high temperature. Grass-and shrub-dominated ecoprovinces had positive relationships with antecedent precipitation or PDSI. For 1977-2003, a few climate variables explain 33-87% (mean = 64%) of WFAB, indicating strong linkages between climate and area burned. For 1916-2003, the relationships are weaker, but climate explained 25-57% (mean = 39%) of the variability. The variance in WFAB is proportional to the mean squared for different data sets at different spatial scales. The importance of antecedent climate (summer drought in forested ecosystems and antecedent winter precipitation in shrub and grassland ecosystems) indicates that the mechanism behind the observed. re-climate relationships is climatic preconditioning of large areas of low fuel moisture via drying of existing fuels or fuel production and drying. The impacts of climate change on. re regimes will therefore vary with the relative energy or water limitations of ecosystems. Ecoprovinces proved a useful compromise between ecologically imprecise state-level and localized gridded fire data. The differences in climate . re relationships among the ecoprovinces underscore the need to consider ecological context (vegetation, fuels, and seasonal climate) to identify specific climate drivers of WFAB. Despite the possible influence of. re suppression, exclusion, and fuel treatment, WFAB is still substantially controlled by climate. The implications for planning and management are that future WFAB and adaptation to climate change will likely depend on ecosystem-specific, seasonal variation in climate.

Under conditions of warming and increasing precipitation that characterizes both observed and projected climate change over much of the NH land area with seasonal snow cover, the sensitivity analysis indicated snow cover duration (SCD) was the snow cover variable exhibiting the strongest climate sensitivity, with sensitivity varying with climate regime and elevation. The highest snow cover-climate sensitivity was found in maritime climates with extensive winter snowfall-for example, the coastal mountains of western North America (NA). Analysis of trends in snow cover duration during the 1966-2007 period of NOAA data showed the largest decreases were concentrated in a zone where seasonal mean air temperatures were in the range of -5 degrees to +5 degrees C that extended around the midlatitudinal coastal margins of the continents. These findings were echoed by the climate models that showed earlier and more widespread decreases in SCD than annual maximum snow water equivalent (SWEmax), with the zone of earliest significant decrease located over the maritime margins of NA and western Europe. The lowest SCD-climate sensitivity was observed in continental interior climates with relatively cold and dry winters, where precipitation plays a greater role in snow cover variability. The sensitivity analysis suggested a potentially complex elevation response of SCD and SWEmax to increasing temperature and precipitation in mountain regions as a result of nonlinear interactions between the duration of the snow season and snow accumulation rates.",2009,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Article,NA,web_of_science,Yes,,,,,,

Andrews Experimental Forest (HJA) in the Oregon Cascade Mountains. The influences of both elevation and aspect on soil variables were measured in the early (1998) and late summer (1994). Increased elevation significantly increased soil moisture, mean annual precipitation, soil organic matter, labile C and mineralizable N, microbial activities, extractable ammonium, and denitrification potentials. In contrast, bulk density, pH and soil temperature (1998 only) were significantly lower at the higher elevations. Relative to labile C, mineralizable N was preferentially sequestered at higher elevations. Aspect significantly affected annual mean temperature and precipitation, soil moisture and temperature, soil organic matter, mineralizable N, extractable ammonium, denitrification, and microbial activities. There were no significant higher statistical interactions between elevation and aspect on climatic or soil factors. Soil organic matter (SOM) accumulation at higher elevations is likely driven by a reduction in decomposition rates rather that an increase in primary productivity, however, SOM accumulation on north facing slopes is probably due to both a decrease in decomposition and an increase in primary production. Models of climate change effects on temperate forest soils based on elevational studies may not apply to aspect gradients since plant productivity may not respond to temperature-moisture gradients in the same way across all topographical features.

The detection variable is the ratio of 1 April snow water equivalent (SWE) to water-year-to-date precipitation (P), chosen to reduce the effect of P variability on the results. Estimates of natural internal climate variability are obtained from 1600 years of two control simulations performed with fully coupled ocean-atmosphere climate models. Estimates of the SWE/P response to anthropogenic greenhouse gases, ozone, and some aerosols are taken from multiple-member ensembles of perturbation experiments run with two models. The D-A shows the observations and anthropogenically forced models have greater SWE/P reductions than can be explained by natural internal climate variability alone. Model-estimated effects of changes in solar and volcanic forcing likewise do not explain the SWE/P reductions.

The assumption is frequently made that discharge and drainage area scale linearly or nearly linearly, i. e., Q = kA(c), where k is the theoretical discharge for a unit area watershed (A = 1), Q is river discharge (m(3)/s), A is drainage area (m(2)), and c is the scaling power dependency. Watershed and longitudinal profile modeling enjoy simplified assumptions if discharge grows linearly with drainage area, and this assumption is widely applied. This paper investigates the scaling relationship between discharge and drainage area for five large rivers, with an emphasis on exploring the linearity of the discharge-area relationship and suggesting causes for significant departure from linearity. The five large mainstem rivers explored (John Day, Salmon, Wabash, Greenbrier, and Yellowstone) all have a minimum of 60 years of continuous discharge records and have been selected to represent a wide geographic area spanning different land uses, climate, and topography. Peak annual flow and mean annual flow are compiled from the U. S. Geological Survey national surface-water database, and a linear regression analysis was completed for each year for the discharges. The five rivers were selected to minimize, but not eliminate, the impacts of dams and diversions such as for irrigation on river discharges. The scaling factor ( c) exhibits both secular and nonsecular trends over the length of record for these five rivers. The results show that the studied watersheds can be grouped into two broad categories based on their respective c values: ( 1) those rivers where c is 1 or nearly 1, and ( 2) those rivers where c is significantly < 1. The John Day, Salmon, Wabash, and Greenbrier rivers scale at values of similar to 0.8 with natural variables including slope, elevation, and evapotranspiration potentially accounting for c values slightly < 1. The second category is c values of similar to 0.5, as exhibited by the Yellowstone River. The Yellowstone watershed is unique for our study because of its secular trend, as well as its overall lower average c values. Climatic trends that control the timing of winter snowpack melting, increased frequency and intensity of forest fires, and increased human consumptive water use in downstream areas may all contribute to the observed behavior in c for this watershed.

Fire behavior in riparian zones is complex, but many aquatic and riparian organisms exhibit a suite of adaptations that allow relatively rapid recovery after fire. Unless constrained by other factors, fish tend to rebound relatively quickly, usually within a decade after a wildfire. Additionally, fire and subsequent erosion events contribute wood and coarse sediment that can create and maintain productive aquatic habitats over time. The potential effects of postfire logging in riparian areas depend on the landscape context and disturbance history of a site; however, available evidence suggests two key management implications: (I) fire in riparian areas creates conditions that may not require intervention to sustain the long-term productivity of the aquatic network and (2) protection of burned riparian areas gives priority to what is left rather than what is removed. Research is needed to determine how postfire logging in riparian areas has affected the spread of invasive species and the vulnerability of upland forests to insect and disease outbreaks and how postfire logging will affect the frequency and behavior of future fires. The effectiveness of using postfire logging to restore desired riparian structure and function is therefore unproven, but such projects are gaining interest with the departure of forest conditions from those that existed prior to timber harvest fire suppression, and climate change. In the absence of reliable information about the potential consequence of postfire timber harvest, we conclude that providing postfire riparian zones with the same environmental protections they received before they burned is justified ecologically.

The objective of this review was to synthesize literature on stand structural dynamics of North American boreal forests, addressing both live tree and coarse woody debris (CWD) characteristics under different disturbance mechanisms (fire, clearcut, wind, and spruce budworm), while identifying regional differences based on climate and surficial deposit variability. In fire origin stands, both live tree and CWD attributes are influenced initially largely by the characteristics of the stand replacing fire and later increasingly by autogenic processes. Differences in stand structure have also been observed between various stand cover types. Blowdown and insect outbreaks are two significant non-stand replacing disturbances that can alter forest stand structure through removing canopy trees, freeing up available growing space, and creating microsites for new trees to establish. Climate and surficial deposits are highly variable in the boreal forest due to its extensive geographic range, influencing stand and landscape structure by affecting tree colonization, stand composition, successional trajectories, CWD dynamics, and disturbance regimes including regional fire cycles. Further, predicted climate change scenarios are likely to cause regional-specific alterations in stand and landscape structure, with the implications on ecosystem components including wildlife, biodiversity, and carbon balance still unclear.

Mountains are also ideal settings to study contaminant transport and behavior along gradients of climate and surface cover. Information on organic contaminants in mountains is compiled from the literature and synthesized, with a focus on atmospheric transport and deposition, contaminant dynamics in alpine lakes and aquatic organisms, and concentration differences with altitude. Diurnal mountain winds, in connection with enhanced deposition at higher elevations caused by low temperatures and high precipitation rates, conspire to make mid-latitude mountains become convergence zones for selected persistent organic chemicals. In particular, the more volatile constituents of contaminant mixtures seem to become enriched, relative to the less volatile constituents at higher altitudes. For selected contaminants, concentration inversions (i.e., concentrations that increase with elevation) have been observed. A notable difference between cold trapping in high latitudes and high altitudes is the likely importance of precipitation. High rates of snow deposition in mid- and high-latitude mountains may lead to a large contaminant release during snowmelt. Regions above the tree line often have little capacity to retain the released contaminants, suggesting the potential for a highly dynamic contaminant fate situation during the snow-free season with significant revolatilization and runoff. The chemical and environmental factors that control the orographic cold trapping of organic contaminants should be examined further by measuring and comparatively interpreting concentration gradients along several mountain slopes with widely different characteristics. Future efforts should further focus on the bioaccumulation and potential effects of contaminants in the upper trophic levels of alpine food chains, on measuring more water-soluble, persistent organic contaminants, and on studying how climate change may affect contaminant dynamics in mountain settings.",2005,Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Review,NA,web_of_science,Yes,,,,,,

Field studies and aerial photography were used to address three questions: (1) What is the range and spatial pattern of lodgepole pine sapling density across the burned Yellowstone landscape and what factors best explain this variability? (2) How do ANPP and LAI vary across the landscape and is their variation explained by abiotic factors, sapling density, or both? (3) What is the predicted spatial pattern of ANPP and LAI across the burned Yellowstone landscape? Stand density spanned six orders of magnitude, ranging from zero to 535,000 saplings ha(-1), and it decreased with increasing elevation and with increasing distance from unburned forest (r(2) = 0.37). Postfire densities mapped from 1:30,000 aerial photography revealed that 66% of the burned area had densities less than 5000 saplings ha(-1) and approximately 25% had densities greater than 10,000 saplings ha(-1); stand density varied spatially in a fine-grained mosaic. New allometric equations were developed to predict aboveground biomass, ANPP, and LAI of lodgepole pine saplings and the 25 most common herbaceous and shrub species in the burned forests. These allometrics were then used with field data on sapling size, sapling density, and percent cover of graminoid, forb, and shrub species to compute stand-level ANPP and LAI. Total ANPP averaged 2.8 Mg ha(-1) y(-3) but ranged from 0.04 to 15.12 Mg ha(-1) y(-1). Total LAI averaged 0.80 m(2) m(-2) and ranged from 0.01 to 6.87 m(2) m(-2). Variation in ANPP and LAI was explained by both sapling density and abiotic factors (elevation and soil class) (ANOVA, r(2) = 0.80); abiotic variables explained 51%-54% of this variation. The proportion of total ANPP contributed by herbaceous plants and shrubs declined sharply with increasing sapling density (r(2) = 0.72) and increased with elevation (r(2) = 0.36). However, total herbaceous productivity was always less than 2.7 Mg ha(-1) y(-1), and herbaceous productivity did not compensate for tree production when trees were sparse.

Andrews (Oregon), Coweeta (North Carolina), Hubbard Brook (New Hampshire), and Luquillo (Puerto Rico). Over 600 basinyears of daily streamflow records were examined from 18 basins that have not experienced human disturbances since at least the 1930s and in some cases much longer periods. This study used statistical methods to systematically evaluate the relationship between precipitation and streamflow at a range of spatial and temporal scales, and draw inferences from these relationships about the hydrologic behavior of the basins. Basins in this study had fundamentally different abilities to store and release moisture at a range of time and space scales. These different hydrologic regimes are the result of different types of forest canopies, snow, and soils in the study basins. Through their influences on interception and transpiration, forest canopies appear to play a very important role in the hydrologic regimes at Andrews and Luquillo, but at Coweeta and Hubbard Brook, the current deciduous forest plays a more limited although seasonally important role. Because of the timing of melt and its interaction with soils, seasonal snowpacks at Hubbard Brook and Andrews have quite different effects upon streamflow and vegetation water use. A variety of water flowpath types in soil, from macropore flow to long flowpaths in deep soils or fractured bedrock, appear to operate at the four sites. Hydrologic regimes may help predict the temporal scales of biogeochemical cycling and stream ecological processes, as well as the magnitude and timing of hydrologic response to disturbance and climate change in headwater basins.

Fire frequency increased and reached its maximum during the early to mid-Holocene from 8200 to 4000 calendar yrs BP, corresponding to the dry and warm Hypsithermal period in the Rocky Mountains. During the Hypsithermal period forests around Dog Lake were dominated by Pseudotsuga/Larix,Pinus and open meadows of Poaceae that were subject to frequent fire.

The six case study sites represent a range of geographic and hydrologic, as well as institutional and social settings. Large, multi-reservoir systems (Columbia River, Missouri River, Apalachicola-Chatahoochee-Flint (ACF) Rivers), small, one or two reservoir systems (Tacoma and Boston) and medium size systems (Savannah River) are represented. The river basins range from mountainous to low relief and semi-humid to semi-arid, and the system operational purposes range from predominantly municipal to broadly multi-purpose. The studies inferred, using a chain of climate downscaling, hydrologic and water resources systems models, the sensitivity of six water resources systems to changes in precipitation, temperature and solar radiation. The climate change scenarios used in this study are based on results from transient climate change experiments performed with coupled ocean-atmosphere General Circulation Models (GCMs) for the 1995 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment. An earlier doubled-CO2 scenario from one of the GCMs was also used in the evaluation. The GCM scenarios were transferred to the local level using a simple downscaling approach that scales local weather variables by fixed monthly ratios (for precipitation) and fixed monthly shifts (for temperature). For those river basins where snow plays an important role in the current climate hydrology (Tacoma, Columbia, Missouri and, to a lesser extent, Boston) changes in temperature result in important changes in seasonal streamflow hydrographs. In these systems, spring snowmelt peaks are reduced and winter flows increase, on average. Changes in precipitation are generally reflected in the annual total runoff volumes more than in the seasonal shape of the hydrographs. In the Savannah and ACF systems, where snow plays a minor hydrological role, changes in hydrological response are linked more directly to temperature and precipitation changes. Effects on system performance varied from system to system, from GCM to GCM, and for each system operating objective (such as hydropower production, municipal and industrial supply, flood control, recreation, navigation and instream flow protection). Effects were generally smaller for the transient scenarios than for the doubled CO2 scenario. In terms of streamflow, one of the transient scenarios tended to have increases at most sites, while another tended to have decreases at most sites. The third showed no general consistency over the six sites. Generally, the water resource system performance effects were determined by the hydrologic changes and the amount of buffering provided by the system's storage capacity. The effects of demand growth and other plausible future operational considerations were evaluated as well.

Study sites were selected on different topographic features at three points along an elevation gradient (ridgetop, valley slope, and valley floor) to characterize site influences on growth response to climate. Mixed species stands were sampled to identify possible differences in species response to climate on a common site. Species differences account for most of the variability in radial growth patterns and response to climate. The greatest differences are between subalpine fir and subalpine larch, while the greatest similarities are between subalpine fir and Engelmann spruce. After species, aspect is the most significant factor affecting growth response to climate. Spring snowpack and summer temperature are the primary climatic factors influencing growth. Spring snowpack is negatively correlated with growth for all three species, but the relationship is strongest for subalpine fir and weakest for subalpine larch. Subalpine larch growth is positively correlated with June temperature. Subalpine fir growth is positively correlated with July-August temperature. Engelmann spruce growth is positively correlated with June-August temperature, but unusually warm July-August temperatures are associated with reduced growth the following year. The response of subalpine forests in the North Cascades to future climate change will depend on winter snowpack accumulations and spring snowmelt rates.

Improving connectivity is widely recommended to preserve the long-term viability of populations, but this requires accurate knowledge of how landscapes influence connectivity. Detectability of landscape effects on gene flow is highly dependent on landscape context, and drawing conclusions from single landscape studies may lead to ineffective management strategies. We present a novel approach to elucidate regional variation in the relative importance of landscape variable effects on gene flow. We demonstrate this approach by evaluating gene flow between isolated, genetically impoverished mountain goat (Oreamnos americanus) populations in Washington and much larger, genetically robust populations in southern British Columbia. We used geneland to identify steep genetic gradients and then employed individual-based landscape genetics in a causal modeling framework to independently evaluate landscape variables that may be generating each of these genetic gradients. Our results support previous findings that freeways, highways, water, agriculture and urban landcover limit gene flow in this species. Additionally, we found that a previously unsupported landscape variable, distance to escape terrain, also limits gene flow in some contexts. By integrating geneland and individual-based methods we effectively identified regional limiting factors that have landscape-level implications for population viability.",2015,Biodiversity & Conservation; Genetics & Heredity,Article,Population connectivity; GENELAND; Circuit theory; Causal modeling; Oreamnos americanus,web_of_science,Yes,,,,,,

Because rivers adjust their channels to accommodate their typical inputs of water and sediment, changes in these variables can potentially alter river morphology. In this study, a hierarchical modeling approach was developed and applied to examine potential changes in reach-averaged bedload transport and spatial patterns of erosion and deposition for three snowmelt-dominated gravelbed rivers in the interior Pacific Northwest. The modeling hierarchy was based on discharge and suspended-sediment load from a basin-scale hydrologic model driven by a range of downscaled climate-change scenarios. In the field, channel morphology and sediment grain-size data for all three rivers were collected. Changes in reach-averaged bedload transport were estimated using the Bedload Assessment of Gravel-bedded Streams (BAGS) software, and the Cellular Automaton Evolutionary Slope and River (CAESAR) model was used to simulate the spatial pattern of erosion and deposition within each reach to infer potential changes in channel geometry and planform. The duration of critical discharge was found to control bedload transport. Changes in channel geometry were simulated for the two higher-energy river reaches, but no significant morphological changes were found for a lower-energy reach with steep, cohesive banks. Changes in sediment transport and river morphology resulting from climate change could affect the management of river systems for human and ecological uses.

Fully understanding their separate and combined effects requires a mechanistic understanding at the local scale where their effects are ultimately realized. Here we applied an individual-based model of fish population dynamics to evaluate the role of local stream variability in modifying responses of Coastal Cutthroat Trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii clarkii) to scenarios simulating identical changes in temperature and stream flows linked to forest harvest, climate change, and their combined effects over six decades. We parameterized the model for four neighboring streams located in a forested headwater catchment in northwestern Oregon, USA with multi-year, daily measurements of stream temperature, flow, and turbidity (20072011), and field measurements of both instream habitat structure and three years of annual trout population estimates. Model simulations revealed that variability in habitat conditions among streams (depth, available habitat) mediated the effects of forest harvest and climate change. Net effects for most simulated trout responses were different from or less than the sum of their separate scenarios. In some cases, forest harvest countered the effects of climate change through increased summer flow. Climate change most strongly influenced trout (earlier fry emergence, reductions in biomass of older trout, increased biomass of young-of-year), but these changes did not consistently translate into reductions in biomass over time. Forest harvest, in contrast, produced fewer and less consistent responses in trout. Earlier fry emergence driven by climate change was the most consistent simulated response, whereas survival, growth, and biomass were inconsistent.

Our goal was to improve understanding of the distribution and ecology of two of the taxa.

We collected habitat data in 2007 and stream temperature data from 2006-2009 to identify correlates of sculpin distributions.

Summer stream temperatures strongly influenced sculpin distributions, with mean August 2007 water temperatures increasing in order of reaches characterized as: Columbia Slimy Sculpin-dominated, syntopic, Rocky Mountain Sculpin-dominated, and no sculpin. Columbia Slimy Sculpin occurred in cold tributaries a the Blackfoot, Clark Fork, and Bitterroot rivers and in two coldwater refugia in the mainstem Bitterroot River. In contrast, Rocky Mountain Sculpin occupied warmer downstream segments of many Blackfoot and Clark Fork river tributaries as well as some mainstem reaches of both rivers but were absent from the Bitterroot River drainage.

Nevertheless, few studies have measured how climatic variation influences genetic diversity within populations or how genetic diversity is distributed across space relative to future climatic stress. Here, we tested whether patterns of genetic diversity (allelic richness) were related to climatic variation and habitat features in 130 bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus) populations from 24 watersheds (i.e., similar to 4-7th order river subbasins) across the Columbia River Basin, USA. We then determined whether bull trout genetic diversity was related to climate vulnerability at the watershed scale, which we quantified on the basis of exposure to future climatic conditions (projected scenarios for the 2040s) and existing habitat complexity. We found a strong gradient in genetic diversity in bull trout populations across the Columbia River Basin, where populations located in the most upstream headwater areas had the greatest genetic diversity. After accounting for spatial patterns with linear mixed models, allelic richness in bull trout populations was positively related to habitat patch size and complexity, and negatively related to maximum summer temperature and the frequency of winter flooding. These relationships strongly suggest that climatic variation influences evolutionary processes in this threatened species and that genetic diversity will likely decrease due to future climate change. Vulnerability at a watershed scale was negatively correlated with average genetic diversity (r=-0.77; P<0.001); watersheds containing populations with lower average genetic diversity generally had the lowest habitat complexity, warmest stream temperatures, and greatest frequency of winter flooding. Together, these findings have important conservation implications for bull trout and other imperiled species.

We used climate data to analyze the history of minimum air temperatures and reconstruct physiological effects of cold on D. ponderosae.

Although from the management perspective information on beetle emergence is crucial in determining an appropriate timing to monitor beetle populations and mitigate outbreaks, especially at the landscape scale in a changing climate, no attempt has yet been made to map the spatiotemporal patterns of beetle emergence across the landscape. In this study, we used a novel heating cycle approach to map potential beetle emergence spatially and temporally. This study reveals that the thermal environment and timing for potential beetle emergence are spatially and temporally synchronous across the landscape. The spatial synchrony in potential beetle emergence occurs at a distance of more than 1500 km across the BC landscape. The spatiotemporal patterns of potential beetle emergence vary with the defined factors (region, period, latitude, elevation, and landform type). At the provincial and regional levels, the thermal environment for potential beetle emergence is surprisingly warmer during 1977-1987 compared to 1999-2010 except for the Southeast region although the provincial climate and weather are generally warmer during 1999-2010 than during 1977-1987, suggesting a small increase in annual temperature may not be enough to significantly improve the thermal environment. A warmer thermal environment with a larger temporal window for potential beetle emergence (i.e., the potential emergence starts earlier and ends later) is associated with the Southeast region, lower latitude and elevation, and landscape topographic features of canyons and valleys. However, although the thermal environment varies with the defined factors, the timing and window of potential beetle peak emergence remain consistent among these defined factors, suggesting that beetles may take different strategies to adapt to temporally synchronized thermal windows in the regions and areas with varied thermal environments. The summarized variables of heating cycles are limited in generally predicting the beetle infestations for a specific period, especially at endemic and incipient levels. However, they may play a greater role in predicting more severely infested areas. The heating cycle approach demonstrated in this study may provide a simple complementary tool to the existing climate suitability models in assessing the impacts of climate change on beetle outbreaks, particularly for those bark beetle species whose physiological responses to temperature have not been fully studied.

Occurrence was positively related to stream length and habitat quality within the isolated stream network and negatively related to elevation and channel gradient. Unexpectedly, the probability of occurrence was not related to how long a habitat patch had been isolated.

Spearman correlations of beetle-caused tree mortality metrics between lidar, LandTrendr, and ADS were low to moderate; low correlations may be due to plot sampling characteristics, RF model error, ADS data subjectivity, and confusion caused by the detection of other types of forest disturbance by LandTrendr.

However, 33.7% of whitebark pine at these treeline study sites were infected by the introduced pathogen Cronartium ribicola, which causes white pine blister rust. We examined the prevalence of whitebark pine, its ecological role, and the incidence of blister rust within two study sites, Tibbs Butte and Wyoming Creek, to the south on the Beartooth Plateau, and within two study sites, Stanley Glacier and Gibbon Pass, to the north in Kootenay and Banff National Parks, for comparison with information from the Rocky Mountain Front (Resler and Tomback, 2008). We found that whitebark pine was an important component of treeline communities in both the southern and northern study areas, although its abundance and ecological role varied with study site. Nearly half the solitary trees sampled overall in the northern and southern study areas were whitebark pine. Whitebark pine was also the most frequently occurring conifer species among tree islands at three of the four study sites. Across all study sites, whitebark pine served as tree island initiator for 29.4% of the tree islands sampled, but was a more frequent initiator within two study sites. Blister rust incidence for the Wyoming Creek study site in the southern study area was 7.7%, and for the Stanley Glacier study site in the northern study area, 16.2%. Damage and mortality over time from Cronartium ribicola will diminish the current ecological role of whitebark pine as a facilitator of landscape vegetation pattern development and may confound predictions of upward movement of treeline in response to climate warming.",2014,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Physical Geography,Article,NA,web_of_science,Yes,,,,,,

Model components include temperature-dependent phenology, host tree colonization determined by an Allee effect, and random-walk dispersal with motility conditioned by host tree density. The model was parameterized at a study site in central Idaho, United States (US), and evaluated at an independent site in northern Washington, US. Phloem and air temperatures, MPB spatial impact data from USDA Forest Service aerial detection surveys, and remotely sensed host tree density data were used to parameterize the model using a maximum likelihood approach. At both study sites the model was highly accurate (>84%) in predicting annual pattern formation when the model was re-initiated each year with the location of new patches of infested trees. Prediction of annual population growth at both sites was also good (>90%), although the model under-predicted area impacted at the Washington site, and at both sites was unable to predict initiation of new small patches.

We measured atmospheric N deposition, lake water quality, and sediment diatoms at our study lakes. Water chemistry showed that our study lakes were ultra-oligotrophic with ammonia and nitrate concentrations often at or below detection limits with low specific conductance (<100 mu S/cm), and acid neutralizing capacities (<400 mu eq/L). Rates of summer bulk inorganic N deposition at all our sites ranged from 0.6 to 2.4 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) and were variable both within and across the parks. Diatom assemblages in a single sediment core from Hoh Lake (Olympic National Park) displayed a shift to increased relative abundances of Asterionella formosa and Fragilaria tenera beginning in the 1969-1975 timeframe, whereas these species were not found at the remaining (nine) sites. These diatom species are known to be indicative of N enrichment and were used to determine an empirical critical load of N deposition, or threshold level, where changes in diatom communities were observed at Hoh Lake. However, N deposition at the remaining nine lakes does not seem to exceed a critical load at this time. At Milk Lake, also in Olympic National Park, there was some evidence that climate change might be altering diatom communities, but more research is needed to confirm this. We used modeled precipitation for Hoh Lake and annual inorganic N concentrations from a nearby National Atmospheric Deposition Program station, to calculate elevation-corrected N deposition for 19802009 at Hoh Lake. An exponential fit to this data was hindcasted to the 1969-1975 time period, and we estimate a critical load of 1.0 to 1.2 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) for wet deposition for this lake.",2014,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Water Resources,Article,Critical loads; N deposition; Diatoms; DIN/TP; National Parks; Lake chemistry,web_of_science,Yes,,,,,,

The intensity of this impact will depend on the dispersal rates of the species, the patchiness of the environment, and the velocity of habitat change. Here we examine how dispersal affects projected future habitat availability for a threatened carnivore, the fisher (Pekania [Martes] pennanti). We used non-invasive genetic sampling to detect fisher across their historical distribution in Montana and Idaho. This survey included 4846 non-invasive hair snares, of which 288 identified fishers through mitochondrial DNA analysis. We modeled the distribution of fisher across western Montana and northern Idaho using a suite of vegetative, topographic, and climatic variables. We modeled future distribution using a global climate model and two climate change scenarios (high emissions [A2] or reduced emissions [B2]) and three time steps (2030, 2060, and 2090). We incorporated the effects of dispersal ability and habitat patch size into our model by varying the distance and enforcing a minimum patch size at which newly created habitat could be colonized. We found that the probability of current fisher occurrence was highest given the presence of mesic forest types with tall trees, high annual precipitation, and mid-range winter temperatures. Future predictions show an increase in area of high-probability habitat under most dispersal assumptions. Interestingly, we found a large contrast in results when minimum patch size and species dispersal capabilities were considered. Our distribution model with full dispersal and no limits on patch size predicted a 24.5% increase in fisher habitat by 2090, whereas a dispersal limit of 1 km through non-habitat (agricultural fields and urban zones) and a minimum patch size yielded a loss of 25.8% of fisher habitat under this same scenario. Varying dispersal appears to limit habitat availability more than minimum patch size under most scenarios.

Relatively little is known about hydrograph (shape, peak flow) influence or the relative importance of chronic and episodic hillslope inputs on channel conditions. To better understand these external drivers, we calculated sediment routing through a gravel-bedded river network using a one-dimensional (1D) bedload transport model. We calculated changes in grain sizes and estimated Chinook salmon habitat suitability caused by a dry year and an extreme flood hydrograph, and chronic (diffusive, overland flow) or pulse (landslide, debris flow) hillslope sediment supplies. To obtain accurate channel conditions, a relatively high reference Shields stress, representative of steep mountain streams, was needed. An extreme event flood without any hillslope sediment inputs caused widespread bed coarsening and a decrease in aquatic habitat. Chronic sediment input combined with this hydrograph eliminated any changes in grain size and habitat, although when combined with a dry year flow, caused systematic bed fining. The influence of a given hydrograph therefore highly depends on the hillslope sediment supply. Regardless of the flow hydrograph or sediment pulse timing, grain size distribution or location, pulse sediment inputs did not cause widespread grain size changes despite being 100 times the total chronic input volume. Widespread and continuous hillslope sediment inputs may influence channel grain sizes and aquatic habitat more than a single discrete sediment pulse. Depending on the magnitudes of flow hydrograph and sediment supply alterations, climate change may induce no differences in grain sizes or very dramatic changes with significant consequences for long-term sustainability.

This unique characteristic, along with the tremendous property damage and potential loss of life that occur with large wildfires with erratic behavior, raised the question of whether future climate will favor rapid wildfire growth so that similar wildfire activity may become more frequent as climate changes. This study addresses this question by examining differences in the climatological distribution of the Haines index (HI) between the current and projected future climate over the western United States. The HI, ranging from 2 to 6, was designed to characterize dry, unstable air in the lower atmosphere that may contribute to erratic or extreme fire behavior. A shift in HI distribution from low values (2 and 3) to higher values (5 and 6) would indicate an increased risk for rapid wildfire growth and spread. Distributions of Haines index are calculated from simulations of current (1971-2000) and future (2041-70) climate using multiple regional climate models in the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program. Despite some differences among the projections, the simulations indicate that there may be not only more days but also more consecutive days with HI 5 during August in the future.

In mountainous areas, such as western North America, recent shifts toward an earlier spring peak flow and decreases in low flow during summer/fall have been reported. We hypothesized that an earlier peak flow could be shifting the timing of low flow and leading to a decrease in the interval between T (max_w) and Q (min). We also examined if years with extreme low Q (min) were associated with years of extreme high T (max_w). We tested these hypotheses using long-term data from 22 minimally human-influenced streams for the period 1950-2010. We found trends toward a shorter time lag between T (max_w) and Q (min) over time and a strong negative association between their magnitudes.

Understanding biotic responses to such perturbations and the contribution of high-elevation headwaters to riverine biodiversity requires the assessment of assemblage composition among habitat types. We compared aquatic insect assemblages among headwater stream segment types in relict glaciated subalpine basins in Mt. Rainier National Park, Washington, USA. Aquatic insects were collected during summer and autumn in three headwater basins. In each basin, three different stream segment types were sampled: colluvial groundwater sources, alluvial lake inlets, and cascade-bedrock lake outlets. Ward's hierarchical cluster analysis revealed high diversity in aquatic insect assemblages, and non-metric multidimensional scaling indicated that spatial and temporal patterns in assemblage composition differed among headwater stream segment types. Aquatic insect assemblages showed more fidelity to stream segment types than to individual basins, and the principal environmental variables associated with assemblage structure were temperature and substrate. Indicator species analyses identified specific aquatic insects associated with each stream segment type. Several rare and potentially endemic aquatic insect taxa were present, including the recently described species, Lednia borealis (Baumann and Kondratieff).

Projected warming over the 21st century is anticipated to shift the phase of precipitation toward more rain and less snow in mountainous areas in the Pacific Northwest, resulting in smaller winter snowpack and in a shift in the timing of runoff to earlier in the year. This will be accompanied by spatially variable changes in the timing of groundwater recharge. Analysis of historic climate and hydrologic data and modeling studies show that groundwater plays a key role in determining the response of stream systems to climate change. The spatial variability in the response of groundwater systems to climate change, particularly with regard to flow-system scale, however, has generally not been addressed in the literature. Here we simulate the hydrologic response to projected future climate to show that the response of groundwater systems can vary depending on the location and spatial scale of the flow systems and their aquifer characteristics. Mean annual recharge averaged over the basin does not change significantly between the 1980s and 2080s climate periods given the ensemble of global climate models and emission scenarios evaluated. There are, however, changes in the seasonality of groundwater recharge within the basin. Simulation results show that short-flow-path groundwater systems, such as those providing baseflow to many head-water streams, will likely have substantial changes in the timing of discharge in response changes in seasonality of recharge. Regional-scale aquifer systems with flow paths on the order of many tens of kilometers, in contrast, are much less affected by changes in seasonality of recharge. Flow systems at all spatial scales, however, are likely to reflect interannual changes in total recharge. These results provide insights into the possible impacts of climate change to other regional aquifer systems, and the streams they support, where discharge points represent a range of flow system scales.

Two important Canadian insects were considered: western spruce budworm (WSBW; Choristoneura occidentalis Freeman, Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), and spruce bark beetle (SBB; Dendroctonus rufipennis Kirby, Coleoptera: Curculionidae). This paper integrates projections of tree species suitability, pest outbreak risk, and bio-economic modelling. Several methods of estimating pest outbreak risk were investigated. A simple climate envelope method based on empirically derived climate thresholds indicates substantial changes in the distribution of outbreaks in British Columbia for two climate scenarios and both pests. A ""proof of concept"" bio-economic model, to inform forest management decisions in a changing climate, considers major stand-level harvest decision factors, such as preservation of old-growth forest, and even harvest flow rates in the presence of changing tree species suitability and outbreak risk. The model was applied to data for the Okanagan Timber Supply Area and also the entire Province of British Columbia. At the provincial level, the model determined little net timber production impact, depending on which of two climate scenarios was considered. Several potentially important factors not considered in this first version of the model are discussed, which indicates that impact may be underestimated by this preliminary study.

We examined changes in understory plant communities following a widespread, drought-induced die-off of trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) in the western United States. We assessed shrub and herbaceous cover and volume in quadrats in 55 plots located across a wide range of levels of aspen mortality. We measured species richness and composition of herbaceous plant communities by recording species presence and absence in 12 sets of paired (1 healthy, 1 dying) aspen plots. Although understory composition in healthy and dying stands was heterogeneous across the landscape, shrub abundance, cover, and volume were higher and abundance of herbaceous species, cover, and volume were lower in dying aspen stands. Shrub cover and volume increased from 2009 to 2011 in dying stands, which suggests that shrub growth and expansion is ongoing. Species richness of herbs declined by 23% in dying stands. Composition of herbs differed significantly between dying and healthy stands. Richness of non-native species did not differ between stand types. The understory community in dying aspen stands was not similar to other shrub-dominated plant communities in the region and may constitute a novel community.

A conceptual snowmelt-runoff model was developed that is forced by daily time series of temperature and precipitation. The model can be run using either observed climate data or artificial climate data generated from a GCM or a stochastic model. The model was applied to a case-study basin, the north fork of the Clearwater River in Idaho, using stochastically generated climate scenarios. Climate scenarios were generated using a contemporaneous auto-regressive integrated moving average (CARIMA) model for temperature and a precipitation model based on a two-state first-order Markov process. A baseline climate scenario was developed that represents recently observed temperature and precipitation conditions and then 15 additional climate scenarios that represent shifts in recent conditions. For each scenario, model application produced an ensemble of 50 streamflow traces each spanning 30 yr. Results show that an increase in temperature among scenarios leads to a decrease in streamflow and vice versa. Decreases in temperature shift the basin runoff to fully snowmelt dominated, whereas increases in temperature increase the frequency of midwinter runoff events. Increasing precipitation leads to increased runoff in cases where the temperature remains the same as the observed record, but not in cases where the temperature increases.

As air temperature increases with global climate change, the character of the generally established seasonal snowcover will be affected. To study the specific response to variable climate, a carefully collected and processed meteorological data set for the 1984-2008 water years (WYs) was assembled for a snow-dominated headwater mountain catchment. The data were used to force a physically based, distributed energy balance snow model to simulate patterns of snow deposition and melt over the catchment for the 25-year period. This period covers both the highest (1984) and lowest (1992) snow seasons on record and exhibits extreme inter-annual variability. This unique forcing data set captured meteorological conditions that resulted in the range of variability in snowcover accumulation, timing of ablation, and the timing and amount of surface water input (SWI), and discharge during the 25-year study period. SWI is the amount of liquid water delivered to the soil surface from melting snow or from rain that passes through the snowcover or falls directly on the soil. Warm winters, characterized by early-and mid-winter rain, triggered earlier inputs from SWI and response in discharge than cool winters. Cool conditions prolonged the generation of SWI and streamflow out of the basin. Very wet conditions that were warm passed 50% of the SWI 27 days earlier and passed 50% of the discharge 15 days earlier, when compared to very wet conditions that were cool. Warmer conditions produced less snow water equivalent, shortened the melt season, and would be expected to extend the summer drought. Copyright.

Mixed-severity forest types are poorly documented and little understood but likely occupy significant areas in the western United States. By definition, mixed-severity types have high beta diversity at meso-scales, encompassing patches of both high and low severity and gradients in between. Studies of mixed-severity types reveal complex landscapes in which patch sizes follow a power law distribution with many small and few large patches. Forest types characterized by mixed severity can be classified according to the modal proportion of high to low severity patches, which increases from relatively dry to relatively mesic site conditions. Mixed-severity regimes are produced by interactions between top-down forcing by climate and bottom-up shaping by topography and the flammability of vegetation, although specific effects may vary widely across the region, especially the relation between aspect and fire severity. History is important in shaping fire behavior in mixed-severity landscapes, as patterns laid down by previous fires can play a significant role in shaping future fires. Like low-severity forests in the western United States, many dry mixed-severity types experienced significant increases in stand density during the 20th century, threatening forest health and biodiversity, however not all understory development in mixed-severity forests increases the threat of severe wild fires. In general, current landscapes have been homogenized, reducing beta diversity and increasing the probability of large fires and insect outbreaks. Further loss of old, fire tolerant trees is of particular concern, but understory diversity has been reduced as well. High stand densities on relatively dry sites increase water use and therefore susceptibility to drought and insect outbreaks, exacerbating a trend of increasing regional drying. The need to restore beta diversity while protecting habitat for closed-forest specialists such as the northern spotted owl call for landscape-level approaches to ecological restoration.

Although transitions between air masses are significant features of the general circulation that influence human activities and other surface processes, they are much more difficult to objectively identify than single variables like temperature or even extreme events like fires, droughts, and floods. The recently developed Spatial Synoptic Classification (SSC) provides a fairly objective means of identifying frontal passages. In this research, we determine the specific meteorological patterns represented by the SSC's Transition category, a ""catch-all"" group that attempts to identify those days that cannot be characterized as a single, homogeneous air mass type. The result is a detailed transition climatology for the continental USA. We identify four subtypes of the Transition category based on intra-day sea level pressure change and dew point temperature change. Across the contiguous USA, most transition days are identified as cold fronts and warm fronts during the winter season. Among the two less common subtypes, transition days in which the dew point temperature and pressure both rise are more frequently observed across the western states, and days in which both variables fall are more frequently observed in coastal regions. The relative frequencies of wintertime warm and cold fronts have changed over the period 1951-2007. Relative cold front frequency has significantly increased in the Northeast and Midwest regions, and warm front frequencies have declined in the Midwest, Rocky Mountain, and Pacific Northwest regions. The overall shift toward cold fronts and away from warm fronts across the northern USA arises from a combination of an enhanced ridge over western North America and a northward shift of storm tracks throughout the mid-latitudes.

We find earlier snowmelt results in increased water delivery curtailments. Historically, the basin experienced substantial water shortages in 14% of years. Without adaptations, for IPCC A1B global emission scenarios, water shortages increase to 27% (13% to 49% range) in the 2020s, to 33% in the 2040s, and 68% in the 2080s. For IPCC B1 emissions scenarios, shortages occur in 24% (7% to 54%) of years in the 2020s, 31% in the 2040s and 43% in the 2080s. Historically unprecedented conditions where senior water rights holders suffer shortfalls occur with increasing frequency in both A1B and B1 scenarios. Economic losses include expected annual production declines of 5%-16%, with greater probabilities of operating losses for junior water rights holders.",NA,NA,Article,NA,web_of_science,Yes,,,,,,

Calibration and validation of the macroscale hydrology model in this highly monitored watershed is key to address the watershed processes that are vulnerable to both natural climate variability and climate change. The model was calibrated using the streamflow data collected between 1997 and 2006 from the three nested weirs, the Reynolds Mountain East (RME), Tollgate and Outlet. For assessing the performance of the calibrated model, this study used 30 years of streamflow data for the period between 1966 and 1996. This investigation suggested that the model predicted streamflow was best at RME, and inadequate at Outlet. Simulated soil moisture was also verified using the data available from five soil moisture measurement sites. The model was able to capture the seasonal patterns of changes in soil water storage considering the differences in the spatial extent of the observed and predicted soil water storage (point measurements against the spatially averaged values for the HRU) and uncertainty associated with the soil moisture measurements due to instrument effects. Water budget partitioning during a wet (1984) water year and a dry (1987) water year were also analyzed to characterize the differences in hydrologic cycles during the extreme hydrologic conditions. Our analysis showed that in the dry water year, vegetation at the higher elevation were under water stress by the end of the water year. Contrastingly, in the wet water year only the vegetation at low and mid-elevations were under water stress whereas vegetation at the higher elevations derived substantial soil moisture for ET processes even towards the end of the growing season. To understand the effect of climate change on the hydrologic cycle, the observed and simulated streamflow were analyzed for trends in Center of Timing (CT). Earlier CT timings for the simulated and observed streamflow at RME weir was obvious thus manifesting global warming signals at the watershed scale level in the Intermountain west region. Observed streamflow at the Tollgate and Outlet weirs, where streamflow is partially affected by the agricultural diversions, showed later CT timings and these results appeared to suggest that climate impact assessment studies need to carefully distinguish the system behavior that is altered by both natural and human-induced changes.

The roles of the various dispersal processes acting as drivers of range expansion are poorly understood for most species. The aim of this paper is to characterize the movement patterns of the mountain pine beetle in areas where range expansion is occurring, in order to describe the fine-scale spatial dynamics of processes associated with mountain pine beetle range expansion. Location Three regions of Canada's Rocky Mountains: Kicking Horse Pass, Yellowhead Pass and Pine Pass. Methods Data on locations of mountain pine beetle-attacked trees of predominantly lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia) were obtained from annual fixed-wing aircraft surveys of forest health and helicopter-based GPS surveys of mountain pine beetle-damaged areas in British Columbia and Alberta. The annual (1999-2005) spatial extents of outbreak ranges were delineated from these data. Spatial analysis was conducted using the spatial-temporal analysis of moving polygons (STAMP), a recently developed pattern-based approach. Results We found that distant dispersal patterns (spot infestations) were most often associated with marginal increases in the areal size of mountain pine beetle range polygons. When the mountain pine beetle range size increased rapidly relative to the years examined, local dispersal patterns (adjacent infestation) were more common. In Pine Pass, long-range dispersal (> 2 km) markedly extended the north-east border of the mountain pine beetle range. In Yellowhead Pass and Kicking Horse Pass, the extension of the range occurred incrementally via ground-based spread. Main conclusions Dispersal of mountain pine beetle varies with geography as well as with host and beetle population dynamics. Although colonization is mediated by habitat connectivity, during periods of low overall habitat expansion, dispersal to new distant locations is common, whereas during periods of rapid invasion, locally connected spread is the dominant mode of dispersal. The propensity for long-range transport to establish new beetle populations, and thus to be considered a driver of range expansion, is likely to be determined by regional weather patterns, and influenced by local topography. We conclude that STAMP appears to be a useful approach for examining changes in biogeograpical ranges, with the potential to reveal both fine- and large-scale patterns.",2009,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Physical Geography,Article,Canada; climate change; Coleoptera; Dendroctonus ponderosae; infestation; insect outbreak; mountain pine beetle; Pinus; range expansion; spatial-temporal patterns,web_of_science,Yes,,,,,,

Habitat restoration strategies that address limited environmental attributes and partial salmon life-history requirements or approaches that attempt to force aquatic habitat to conform to idealized but ecologically unsustainable conditions may partly explain this lack of response. Natural watershed processes generate highly variable environmental conditions and population responses, i.e., multiple life histories, that are often not considered in restoration. Examples from several locations underscore the importance of natural variability to the resilience of Pacific salmon. The implication is that habitat restoration efforts will be more likely to foster salmon resilience if they consider processes that generate and maintain natural variability in fresh water. We identify three specific criteria for management based on natural variability: the capacity of aquatic habitat to recover from disturbance, a range of habitats distributed across stream networks through time sufficient to fulfill the requirements of diverse salmon life histories, and ecological connectivity. In light of these considerations, we discuss current threats to habitat resilience and describe how regulatory and restoration approaches can be modified to better incorporate natural variability.",2009,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Article,Pacific salmon; habitat restoration; watershed processes; natural variation,web_of_science,Yes,,,,,,

North Cascade glacier retreat is rapid and ubiquitous. All 47 monitored glaciers are currently undergoing a significant retreat and four of them have disappeared. Annual mass balance measured on ten glaciers, averaging 30-50 m in thickness, yields a mean cumulative annual balance for the 1984-2006 period of -12.4 m water equivalent (m we), a net loss of 14 m in glacier thickness and 20-40% loss of their total volume in two decades. The data indicate broad regional continuity in North Cascades glacial response to climate. The substantial negative annual balances have accompanied significant thinning in the accumulation zone of 75% of North Cascade glaciers monitored. This is indicative of glacier disequilibrium; a glacier in disequilibrium will not survive the current warmer climate trend. Alpine snowpack snow water equivalent (SWE) on April I has declined 25% since 1946 at five USDA Snow Course sites. This decline has occurred in spite of a slight increase in winter precipitation. The combination of a decline in winter snowpack and a 0.6 degrees increase in ablation season temperature, during the 1946-2005 period in the North Cascades, has altered alpine strearnflow in six North Cascade basins. Observed changes in streamflow are: increased winter streamflow, slightly declining spring strearnflow and a 27% decline in summer strearnflow. Only in the heavily glaciated Thunder Creek Basin (>10% glaciated) has summer strearnflow declined less than 10%; this is attributable to enhanced glacier melting.",2008,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Article,NA,web_of_science,Yes,,,,,,

Climatic change will have significant impacts on natural disturbances, species and ecosystems, particularly on landscapes influenced by forest management. Understanding where vulnerabilities lie is important in managing the risks associated directly or indirectly with climatic change. The vulnerability of landscapes to natural disturbances, the resilience of ecosystems and distribution of species are all important components that need to be considered when undertaking forest planning, but climatic change is rarely factored into such planning. In this study, the vulnerability of fire potential, fire regimes, ecosystems and species to climatic change was modelled for a 145,000 ha landscape in the south-central interior of British Columbia, Canada. The results from these analyses were used to guide forest zoning, using the triad zoning framework, and for the development of a ""climate-smart"" management framework. The use of climate-smart management is advocated as a decision-making framework for managing forested landscapes based on an understanding of landscape vulnerability to future climatic change. From this understanding, the maintenance of ecosystem health and vitality could be achieved. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Modelling the response of species in their regeneration niche to phenological and biophysical processes that are directly influenced by climate is one method for achieving this understanding. A model was developed to investigate species resilience and vulnerability to climate change within its fundamental-regeneration niche. The utility of the developed model, tree and climate assessment (TACA), was tested within the interior Douglas-fir ecosystem in south-central British Columbia. TACA modelled the current potential tree species composition of the ecosystem with high accuracy and modelled significant responses amongst tree species to climate change. The response of individual species suggests that the studied ecosystem could transition to a new ecosystem over the next 100 years. TACA showed that it can be an effective tool for identifying species resilience and vulnerability to changes in climate within the most sensitive stage of development, the regeneration phase. The TACA model was able to identify the degree of change in phenological and biophysical variables that control tree establishment, growth and persistence. The response to changes in one or more of these variables resulted in changes in the climatic suitability of the ecosystem for species and enabled a measure of vulnerability to be quantified. TACA could be useful to forest managers as a decision support tool for adaptation actions and by researchers interested in modelling stand dynamics under climate change. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The analysis of two-way nested 36-12-km MM5 simulations during the 1998 snowmelt season (April-June) shows that the snow water equivalent (SWE) is underestimated when there are conditions with higher temperature and greater precipitation than observations. An observed daily SWE dataset derived from the snow telemetry network was assimilated into the Noah land surface model within MM5. This SWE assimilation reduces the warm bias. The reduction of the warm bias results from suppressed upward sensible heat flux caused by the decreased skin temperature. This skin temperature reduction is the result of the longer assimilated snow duration than in the model run without SWE assimilation. Meanwhile, the cooled surface leads to a more stable atmosphere, resulting in a decrease in the exaggerated precipitation. Additionally, the detailed analysis of the snowmelt indicates that the absence of vegetation fraction in the most sophisticated land surface model ( Noah) in the MM5 package results in an overestimation of solar radiation reaching the snow surface, giving rise to heavier snowmelt. An underestimated surface albedo also weakly contributes to the stronger snowmelt. The roles of the vegetation fraction and albedo in snowmelt are further verified by an additional offline simulation from a more realistic land surface model with advanced snow and vegetation schemes forced by the MM5 output. An improvement in SWE description is clearly seen in this offline simulation over the Sierra Nevada region.",2007,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Article,NA,web_of_science,Yes,,,,,,

We asked how variation in the frequency of large fire events affects (1) the mean and annual variability of age and tree density (defined by postfire sapling density and subsequent stand density) of lodgepole pine stands and (2) the spatial pattern of stand age and density across the landscape. The model incorporates spatial and temporal variation in fire and serotiny in predicting postfire sapling densities of lodgepole pine. Empirical self-thinning and in-filling curves alter initital postfire sapling densities over decades to centuries. In response to a six-fold increase in the probability of large fires (0.003 to 0.018 year), mean stand age declined from 291 to 121 years. Mean stand density did not increase appreciably at high elevations (1,029 to 1,249 stems ha(-1)) where serotiny was low and postfire sapling density was relatively low (1,252 to 2,203 stems ha(-1)). At low elevations, where prefire serotiny and postfire lodgepole pine density are high, mean stand densities increased from 2,807 to 7,664 stems ha(-1). Spatially, the patterns of stand age became more simplified across the landscape, yet patterns of stand density became more complex.

Because instrumental records for the region are limited to the twentieth century, knowledge of the range of variability associated with these moisture anomalies and their impacts on ecosystems and physical processes are limited. The authors developed a reconstruction of summer ( June - August) moisture variability spanning A. D. 1540 - 2000 from a multispecies network of tree-ring chronologies in Glacier NP. Decadal-scale drought and pluvial regimes were defined as any event lasting 10 yr or greater, and the significance of each potential regime was assessed using intervention analysis. Intervention analysis prevents single intervening years of average or opposing moisture conditions from ending what was otherwise a sustained moisture regime. The reconstruction shows numerous decadal-scale shifts between persistent drought and wet events prior to the instrumental period ( before A. D. 1900). Notable wet events include a series of three long-duration, high-magnitude pluvial regimes spanning the end of the Little Ice Age ( A. D. 1770 - 1840). Though the late-nineteenth century was marked by a series of > 10 yr droughts, the single most severe dry event occurred in the early-twentieth century ( A. D. 1917 - 41). These decadal-scale dry and wet events, in conjunction with periods of high and low snowpack, have served as a driver of ecosystem processes such as forest fires and glacial dynamics in the Glacier NP region. Using a suite of paleoproxy reconstructions and information from previous studies examining the relationship between climate variability and natural processes, the authors explore how such persistent moisture anomalies affect the delivery of vital goods and services provided by Glacier NP and surrounding areas. These analyses show that regional water resources and tourism are particularly vulnerable to persistent moisture anomalies in the Glacier NP area. Many of these same decadal-scale wet and dry events were also seen among a wider network of hydroclimatic reconstructions along a north - south transect of the Rocky Mountains. Such natural climate variability can, in turn, have enormous impacts on the sustainable provision of natural resources over wide areas. Overall, these results highlight the susceptibility of goods and services provided by protected areas like Glacier NP to natural climate variability, and show that this susceptibility will likely be compounded by the effects of future human-induced climate change.",2006,Geology,Article,paleoclimatology; Glacier National Park; ecosystem services,web_of_science,Yes,,,,,,

Here we investigate the extent to which Atmospheric and climatic variability may contribute to variability in annual area burned on 20 National Forests in. Washington,,Oregon, and Idaho. Empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis was used to identify coherent patterns in area burned by wildfire in the Pacific Northwest. Anomaly fields of 500-hPa height were regressed onto the resulting principal-component time series.,to identify the patterns in atmospheric circulation that are associated with variability in area burned by wildfire. Additionally, cross-correlation functions were calculated for the Palmer drought severity index (PDSI) over the year preceding the wildfire season. Parallel analyses based on superposed epoch analysis focused only on the extreme fire years (both large and small) to discriminate the controls on extreme years from the linear responses identified in the regression analyses. Four distinct patterns in area burned were identified, each associated,with distinct-climatic processes. Extreme wildfire years are forced at least in part by antecedent drought and summertime blocking,in the 500-hPa height field. However the response to these forcing's is modulated by the ecology of the dominant forest. In more mesic forest types. antecedent, drought is a necessary precondition for forests to burn, but it is not a good predictor of area burned due to the rarity of subsequent ignition. At especially dry locations, summertime blocking events can lead to increases in area burned even in the absence of antecedent drought. At particularly xeric locations summertime cyclones can also lead to increased area burned, probably due to dry lightning storms that bring ignition and strong winds but little precipitation.. These results suggest that fuels treatments alone may not be effective at reducing area burned under extreme climatic conditions and furthermore that anthropogenic climate change may have important implications for forest management.",2005,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Article,climatic variability; empirical orthogonal function analysis; Pacific Decadal Oscillation; Pacific Northwest; top-down controls; wildfire,web_of_science,Yes,,,,,,

Aspen seedling presence and density were characterized as a function of elevation, geologic substrate, slope, aspect, vegetation/ cover type, presence of burned forest, and distance to nearest adult aspen stand. Presence of aspen seedlings was best predicted by the incidence of burned forest and proximity to adult aspen; aspen seedlings were only found in burned forest and were more likely to occur closer to adult aspen clones. When tested against independent data collected in 1997, the logistic regression model for aspen seedling presence performed well ( overall accuracy = 73%, Tau(p) = 0.41). When present, variation in aspen seedling density at local scales (less than or equal to 200 m) was largely explained by elevation, with higher densities observed at lower elevations. At broad scales (> 1 km), seedling density was a function of cover type, elevation, aspect, slope, and burn severity, with greater seedling density in more severely burned forested habitats on southerly, shallow slopes at lower elevations. Aspen seedling densities ranged from 0 to 46,000 seedlings/ha with a median density of 2,000/ha on sites where they occurred. Aspen seedlings were most abundant in the south central and southwest central regions of the park, approximately an order of magnitude less abundant in the southeast region, and nearly absent in the north central area.

The two study watersheds are the Upper Campbell and the Illecillewaet watersheds located in British Columbia. The first watershed is a maritime watershed located on the east slopes of the Vancouver Island mountains whereas the second watershed is located in the Selkirk Mountains in Eastern British Columbia. The Canadian Climate Centre General Circulation Model (CCC GCM) has been used for the estimation of the effect of the climate change on meteorological parameters. The CCC GCM is a steady state model and the output of the 1991 run has been used. In addition to the changes in the amounts of precipitation and temperature usually assumed in hydrological climate change studies, other meteorological and climatic parameters are also considered; specifically, the effect of climate on the spatial distribution of precipitation with elevation, and also on cloud cover, glaciers, vegetation distribution, vegetation biomass production, and plant physiology. The results showed that the mean annual temperature in the two watersheds could increase by more than 3 degrees C and the annual basin-wide precipitation could increase by 7.5% in Upper Campbell watershed and by about 17% in the Illecillewaet watershed. As a result, the mean annual runoff will increase by 7.5% in the Upper Campbell watershed and 21% in the Illecillewaet basin. For the study of floods, nine flood parameters have been investigated, the total number of flood episodes, the flood days per year, the duration of flood events, the annual flood volume, the mean flood flow, the mean flood peak, the annual maximum flood peak, the day of occurrence of the centroid of flood volume, and the day of occurrence of annual maximum flood peak. These nine parameters were extracted from the hydro-graphs of the two study watersheds using the double long-term mean daily flow. The study showed that, under the climate change scenario, the floods in the maritime Upper Campbell watershed would increase, on average, in magnitude by 14%, in volume by 94%, in frequency by 11%, and duration by 44%. The timing of the floods would remain almost unchanged, and the centroid of flood volume would shift earlier by only 2 days. In contrast, in the interior mountain Illecillewaet watershed, the floods would decrease, on average, in magnitude by 7%, in volume by 38%, and frequency by 23%. The duration of flood events, under the altered climate scenario, would remain, essentially, unchanged increasing by only 2.6%. Also, the study showed that in the Illecillewaet: watershed the largest change between the altered climate and the present climate scenarios would be the timing of floods since the centroid of flood volume would occur 20 days earlier. The above changes in the flood response of the two study watersheds can be explained by the changes in the distribution and form of annual precipitation.

In montane hydric meadows, tree establishment was spatially clumped beneath large old trees and on elevated microsites; however the timing of invasion differed between sites with stable versus fluctuating water tables. in upland mesic/dry montane meadows, timing of invasion corresponded with cessation of sheep grazing (early 1940s) and the onset of wetter summers (mid 1940s). In the subalpine zone, climate and aspect interacted to produce contrasting histories of invasion on north- and south-facing slopes. Establishment on north-facing slopes, concentrated in heath-shrub communities, coincided with regional warming (ca. 1920-1945) when snowpacks were lighter and melted earlier. Recruitment of trees onto south-facing slopes occurred later, when conditions were wetter (1945-1985). In many environments, the spatial distribution of recruitment suggests that once trees have established, autogenic factors become increasingly important as individual trees or groups of trees alter the physical or biotic conditions that once inhibited establishment. Knowledge of the factors that influence invasion, and of their varying importance across gradients in environment and vegetation, is critical to predicting future changes in these dynamic systems.",1998,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,Article,climate change; ecotone; forest-meadow boundary; meadow invasion; montane meadow; Pacific Northwest; subalpine meadow; Three Sisters Biosphere Reserve; tree ring,web_of_science,Yes,,,,,,

The Canadian Climate Centre General Circulation model has been used for the prediction of potential effects of climate change on meteorological parameters. In addition to the changes in the amounts of precipitation and temperature usually assumed in hydrologic climate change studies, other meteorological and climatic parameters also considered are the effect of climate on the spatial distribution of precipitation with elevation, as well as on cloud cover, glaciers, vegetation distribution, vegetation biomass production, and plant physiology. The results showed that the mean annual temperature in the two watersheds could increase by more than 3 degrees C and the annual basinwide precipitation could increase by 7.5% in the Upper Campbell watershed and by about 17% in the Illecillewaet watershed. The higher temperatures changed some snowfall to rainfall and the extra precipitation was mainly in the form of rain. The increase of the CO(2) concentration caused stomata closure that reduced evapotranspiration. This effect was compensated by increased biomass in the Upper Campbell watershed, but not in the Illecillewaet watershed. These changes produced higher flows in winter and smaller flows in summer. The largest change in the hydrograph shape was in the Illecillewaet watershed where the mean annual maximum daily flow decreased by about 13% and its frequency was reduced. On the other hand, the mean annual runoff increased by 21%. In contrast, although the shape of the simulated annual hydrograph of the Upper Campbell watershed was not affected, magnitude and frequency of the annual maximum precipitation increased. Also, the mean annual runoff in the Upper Campbell watershed increased by 7.5%.

That is particularly true for stream fishes and cold-water species like trout, salmon, and char that are already constrained to high elevations and latitudes. The extreme climates in those environments also preclude invasions by most non-native species, so identifying especially cold habitats capable of absorbing future climate change while still supporting native populations would highlight important refugia. By coupling crowd-sourced biological datasets with high-resolution stream temperature scenarios, we delineate network refugia across >250000 stream km in the Northern Rocky Mountains for two native salmonidsbull trout (BT) and cutthroat trout (CT). Under both moderate and extreme climate change scenarios, refugia with high probabilities of trout population occupancy (>0.9) were predicted to exist (33-68 BT refugia; 917-1425 CT refugia). Most refugia are on public lands (>90%) where few currently have protected status in National Parks or Wilderness Areas (<15%). Forecasts of refuge locations could enable protection of key watersheds and provide a foundation for climate smart planning of conservation networks. Using cold water as a climate shield' is generalizable to other species and geographic areas because it has a strong physiological basis, relies on nationally available geospatial data, and mines existing biological datasets.

Insect epidemics, wildfires, and timber harvest have greatly affected North American C budgets in the last century. Research is needed to understand how forest C dynamics (source duration and recovery time) following disturbance vary as a function of disturbance type, severity, forest type, and initial C stocks. We used the Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS) to simulate total C stocks (excluding soil) for 100 years following three types of disturbance (fire, harvest, and insects) with four levels of severity. We initiated the model using empirical data from a large representative sample of forest conditions on the national forest ownership in the Rocky Mountain region (Forest Inventory and Analysis data). Unlike analyses based on stand age, an ambiguous quantity with respect to disturbance history, our approach enables explicit consideration of disturbance type and severity, as well as pre-disturbance forest C. On average, stands became a C sink after fire in 5, 6, 14, and 23 years for low to high-severity fire. Pre-fire C stocks were reached 25-55 years later. Following bark beetle epidemics, on average stands continued to be a C source for 10 years longer than fire and up to 40 years longer in some cases, but pre-disturbance C stocks were reached in a similar amount of time. C stocks following harvest showed the largest initial decline, but on average stands became a sink sooner at 1, 5, 15, and 12 years post-harvest for low to high-severity harvests. Differences in C dynamics based on disturbance type and severity, initial conditions, and forest type demonstrate the importance of considering this variability when modeling forest C dynamics. The regionally averaged models of C response quantified in this study can be combined with remotely sensed data on disturbance type and severity and used with C accounting approaches that rely on growth and yield or state and transition models.

In the Pacific Northwest vegetation fires regularly produce PyC, but its accumulation in soils is poorly quantified. Using mid-infrared spectroscopy (MIR) and partial least-squares (PLS) analysis in conjunction with ultraviolet photo-oxidation followed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (UV-NMR) techniques, PyC contents were quantified for samples from soil profiles along a vegetation gradient. Sample locations included different forest types as well as sites under agricultural use. While PyC was most prevalent in the first 0.2 m with 7-24% of total soil organic C (SOC), it could be found in the subsoil of all locations. However, PyC concentrations did not change consistently with soil depth. Stock sizes were lowest at the Turkey Farm (0.71 kg m(-2); 10% of SOC) and Organic Growers Farm (1.14 kg m(-2); 8% of SOC) sites, presumably due to the pervasive combustion of grass and cereals. Among the forested sites, lower stocks were observed at sites with higher mean annual temperature (MAT) and lower mean annual precipitation (MAP) such as Metolius (1.71 kg m(-2); 15% of SOC) and Juniper (1.89 kg m(-2); 26% of SOC). In contrast, the highest PyC stocks were found under cooler and moister conditions at Cascade Head dominated by Douglas Fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.))

As warming continues, fires may also increase in severity and produce larger contiguous patches of severely burned areas. We used remotely sensed burn-severity data from 125 fires in the northern Cascade Range of Washington, USA, to explore relationships between fire size, severity, and the spatial pattern of severity. We examined relationships between climate and the annual area burned and the size of wildfires over a 25-year period. We tested the hypothesis that increased fire size is commensurate with increased burn severity and increased spatial aggregation of severely burned areas. We also asked how local ecological controls might modulate these relationships by comparing results over the whole study area (the northern Cascade Range) to those from four ecological subsections within it. We found significant positive relationships between climate and fire size, and between fire size and the proportion of high severity and spatial-pattern metrics that quantify the spatial aggregation of high-severity areas within fires, but the strength and significance of these relationships varied among the four subsections. In areas with more contiguous subalpine forests and less complex topography, the proportion and spatial aggregation of severely burned areas were more strongly correlated with fire size. If fire sizes increase in a warming climate, changes in the extent, severity, and spatial pattern of fire regimes are likely to be more pronounced in higher-severity fire regimes with less complex topography and more continuous fuels.",2014,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Article,"bottom-up controls; burn severities; climate change; fire regimes; FRAGSTATS; North Cascades, Washington, USA; patch dynamics; relative differenced normalized burn ratio; RdNBR; remote sensing; top-down controls; topography",web_of_science,Yes,,,,,,

Interannual snowpack variability has been attributed to large-scale climate patterns including the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), however, the contribution of snowfall frequency and extreme snowfall events to this variability are less well quantified. Long-term records from Snowpack Telemetry and Cooperative Observer Program stations in the 11 western states were used to investigate these relationships by considering the number of snowfall days and snowfall water equivalent (SFE) of extreme snowfall events. The top decile of snowfall events contributed 20-38% of annual SFE, depending on the region. An average of 65% and 69% of the interannual variability in annual SFE was explained by snowfall days and SFE of top decile snowfall events, respectively, with extreme events being a more significant predictor at most stations. The latitudinal dipole in SFE during ENSO phases results from changes in snowfall frequency and extreme events. In the Pacific Northwest, above normal SFE during La Nina winters was a product of both larger contributions from extremes and more snowfall days, while below normal SFE during El Nino winters was primarily associated with a substantial reduction in extremes. Conversely, annual SFE during ENSO phases in the mountains of Arizona was more closely linked to fluctuations in snowfall days than extremes. Results indicate the importance of extreme snowfall events in shaping interannual variability in water resources and suggest that improved predictive ability may inform better water resource management now and in the coming decades.",2014,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Water Resources,Article,snow; climate variability; extreme events; hydroclimatology,web_of_science,Yes,,,,,,

Climate and weather conditions influence beetle population dynamics, and managers and policymakers are concerned about the potential effects of climate change on outbreaks. Here we studied five locations with extensive outbreaks in lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) forests across the western United States. Using observations and modeling, we quantified means and changes relative to prior years of three climate or weather factors associated with outbreaks: (1) year-round temperatures that affect adaptive seasonality; (2) low temperatures that induce mortality of overwintering beetles; and (3) drought stress of host trees. Climate variable means varied among locations, indicating the beetle's tolerance to different climate during outbreaks. Analyses of climate or weather factors as outbreaks progressed revealed that year-round temperatures during outbreaks were typically higher than in prior years, and outbreak years lacked very low winter temperatures that often occurred in prior years. Drought was present at each location during some time of an outbreak, and increases in beetle-caused tree mortality at lower beetle population levels (as indicated by killed trees) were usually coincident with drought. Furthermore, drought was not required to maintain large outbreaks; in several locations, relief from drought during periods of high tree mortality did not cause subsequent declines in tree mortality. We did not find strong evidence that maladaptive seasonality, cold-induced mortality, or drought stress was responsible for decreases in tree mortality, suggesting the role of host depletion. Large variability in the relationships between climate or weather variables and outbreaks suggests that different climate and weather factors may have been limiting outbreaks at different times and that these factors did not influence beetle-caused tree mortality similarly among locations. Our results increase understanding of the climate and weather factors that influence beetle outbreaks and their variability in space and time and will lead to more accurate predictions of future patterns of outbreaks that consider future climate.

Considering projected increases in air temperature and changes in precipitation in the coming century, accurate assessment of suitable thermal habitats in freshwater systems is critical for predicting aquatic species' responses to changes in climate and for guiding adaptation strategies. We use a hydrologic model coupled with a stream temperature model and downscaled general circulation model outputs to explore the spatially and temporally varying changes in stream temperature for the late 21st century at the subbasin and ecological province scale for the Columbia River basin (CRB). On average, stream temperatures are projected to increase 3.5 degrees C for the spring, 5.2 degrees C for the summer, 2.7 degrees C for the fall, and 1.6 degrees C for the winter. While results indicate changes in stream temperature are correlated with changes in air temperature, our results also capture the important, and often ignored, influence of hydrological processes on changes in stream temperature. Decreases in future snowcover will result in increased thermal sensitivity within regions that were previously buffered by the cooling effect of flow originating as snowmelt. Other hydrological components, such as precipitation, surface runoff, lateral soil water flow, and groundwater inflow, are negatively correlated to increases in stream temperature depending on the ecological province and season. At the ecological province scale, the largest increase in annual stream temperature was within the Mountain Snake ecological province, which is characterized by migratory coldwater fish species. Stream temperature changes varied seasonally with the largest projected stream temperature increases occurring during the spring and summer for all ecological provinces.

Although wildfires are some of the most important ecological processes in forest ecosystems, large-scale wildfires are often perceived as an environmental disaster. Since failure to include the dynamic nature of ecosystems in planning will inevitably lead to unexpected outcomes, we need to enhance our ability to cope with future extreme events coupled with climate change. This study presents several future scenarios in three different time periods for Canada's Columbia Montane Cordillera Ecoprovince, which is prone to wildfires. These scenarios predict the probability of occurrence of widespread wildfires based on the hierarchical Bayesian model. The model was based on the relationships between wildfires and the Monthly Drought Code (MDC). The MDC is a generalized monthly version of the Daily Drought Code widely used across Canada by forest fire management agencies for monitoring of wildfire risk. To calculate future MDC values, we relied on different possible future conditions of climate, given by the Global Circulation Models. We found a regime shift in drought intensity with abrupt decreases in lightning-caused wildfire activity around 1940, suggesting that future wildfire risks can be inferred primarily from the summer drought code. For future periods, we found increasing trends in the probabilities of large-scale fires with time in most areas. It should be notable that, by the 2080s, there is a probability of some areas having more than 50% of large-scale wildfires under the ""average"" climatic conditions in the future, indicating that, even without ""extreme"" weather conditions, some ecosystems will have a fundamental probability of experiencing catastrophic fires under the condition of average summer. However, the rate of progression toward a fire-prone condition is quite different among the three climate change scenarios and among the region analyzed. Given such scenario-sensitive, spatially-heterogeneous patterns of wildfire probability in response to climate variability, management strategy should be flexible and more localized. By drawing on this knowledge, it may be possible to mitigate climate change impacts both before they arise and once they have occurred. These considerations are critical for maintaining the integrity of systems shaped by large-scale natural disturbances to increase their resilience to the changing climate while protecting human society and infrastructures. Working with alternative scenarios will facilitate our adaptation to climate change in managing fire-prone forest ecosystems. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We develop fire prediction models by regressing meteorological variables from the current and previous years together with fire indexes onto observed regional area burned. The regressions explain 0.25-0.60 of the variance in observed annual area burned during 1980-2004, depending on the ecoregion. We also parameterize daily area burned with temperature, precipitation, and relative humidity. This approach explains similar to 0.5 of the variance in observed area burned over forest ecoregions but shows no predictive capability in the semi-arid regions of Nevada and California. By applying the meteorological fields from 15 climate models to our fire prediction models, we quantify the robustness of our wildfire projections at midcentury. We calculate increases of 24-124% in area burned using regressions and 63-169% with the parameterization. Our projections are most robust in the southwestern desert, where all GCMs predict significant (p < 0.05) meteorological changes. For forested ecoregions, more GCMs predict significant increases in future area burned with the parameterization than with the regressions, because the latter approach is sensitive to hydrological variables that show large inter-model variability in the climate projections. The parameterization predicts that the fire season lengthens by 23 days in the warmer and drier climate at midcentury. Using a chemical transport model, we find that wildfire emissions will increase summertime surface organic carbon aerosol over the western United States by 46-70% and black carbon by 20-27% at midcentury, relative to the present day.

We focused on forested watersheds of western North America because this region is projected to experience CC-induced alteration of terrestrial processes. This provided a backdrop for investigating interactive effects of climate and terrestrial responses on streams. Because stream responses to terrestrial processes have been well-studied in contexts largely independent of CC research, we synthesized this knowledge to demonstrate how CC-induced alterations of terrestrial ecosystems may affect streams. Our synthesis indicated that altered terrestrial processes will change terrestrial-aquatic linkages and autotrophic production, potentially yielding greater sensitivity of streams to CC than would be expected based on shifts in temperature and precipitation regime alone. Despite uncertainties that currently constrain predictions regarding stream responses to these additional pathways of change, this synthesis highlighted broader effects of CC that require additional research.

Although the synoptic characteristics of the daytime and nighttime heat events are similar, they do indicate some differences between the two types of events. Most notable is a stronger influence of downslope warming over the Cascade Mountains for the daytime events versus a more important role of precipitable water content for the nighttime events, presumably through its impact on downward longwave radiative fluxes. Current research suggests that the frequency and duration of heat waves are expected to increase in much of the United States, and analysis of the heat events reveals that a significant, increasing trend in the frequency of the nighttime events is already occurring in the Pacific Northwest. A heat wave occurred in 2009 that set all-time-record maximum temperatures in many locations and ranked as the second strongest daytime event and the longest nighttime event in the record.",2013,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Article,NA,web_of_science,Yes,,,,,,

The American pika (Ochotona princeps) is a small alpine mammal with limited dispersal capacity and low tolerance for thermal stress. As a result, pikas have become an important system for examining biotic responses to changing climatic conditions. Previous research using amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) has revealed evidence for environmental-mediated selection in O. princeps populations distributed along elevation gradients, yet the anonymity of AFLP loci and lack of available genomic resources precluded the identification of associated gene regions. Here, we harnessed next-generation sequencing technology in order to characterize the American pika transcriptome and identify a large suite of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which can be used to elucidate elevation-and site-specific patterns of sequence variation. Results: We constructed pooled cDNA libraries of O. princeps from high (1400m) and low (300m) elevation sites along a previously established transect in British Columbia. Transcriptome sequencing using the Roche 454 GS FLX titanium platform generated 780 million base pairs of data, which were assembled into 7,325 high coverage contigs. These contigs were used to identify 24,261 novel SNP loci. Using high resolution melt analysis, we developed 17 of these SNPs into genotyping assays, which were validated with independent DNA samples from British Columbia Canada and Oregon State USA. In addition, we detected haplotypes in the NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5 of the mitochondrial genome that were fixed and different among elevations, suggesting that this may be an informative target gene for studying the role of cellular respiration in local adaptation. We also identified contigs that were unique to each elevation, including a high elevation-specific contig that was a positive match with the hemoglobin alpha chain from the plateau pika, a species restricted to high elevation steppes in Asia. Elevation-specific contigs may represent candidate regions subject to differential levels of gene expression along this elevation gradient. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first broad-scale, transcriptome-level study conducted within the Ochotonidae, providing novel genomic resources for studying pika ecology, behaviour and population history.",NA,NA,Article,Adaptation; Elevation gradient; Next-generation sequencing; Ochotona princeps; Population genomics; Single nucleotide polymorphisms,web_of_science,Yes,,,,,,

To address this uncertainty, we evaluated the differences in model performance and interpretations of a species' thermal niche when using different measures of stream temperature and surrogates for stream temperature. Specifically, we used a logistic regression modeling framework with three different indicators of stream thermal conditions (elevation, air temperature, and stream temperature) referenced to a common set of Brook Trout Salvelinus fontinalis distribution data from the Boise River basin, Idaho. We hypothesized that stream temperature predictions that were contemporaneous with fish distribution data would have stronger predictive performance than composite measures of stream temperature or any surrogates for stream temperature. Across the different indicators of thermal conditions, the highest measure of accuracy was found for the model based on stream temperature predictions that were contemporaneous with fish distribution data (percent correctly classified = 71%). We found considerable differences in inferences across models, with up to 43% disagreement in the amount of stream habitat that was predicted to be suitable.

As such, these systems may be especially vulnerable to climate change because of potential shifts in the frequency, magnitude, and timing of flows that can scour incubating embryos. A general framework is presented to examine this issue, using a series of physical models that link climate change, streamflow, and channel morphology to predict the magnitude and spatial distribution of streambed scour and consequent risk to salmonid embryos at basin scales. The approach is demonstrated for a mountain catchment in the Northern Rocky Mountains, USA. Results show that risk of critical scour varies as a function of species and life history and is modulated by local variations in lithology and channel confinement. Embryos of smaller-bodied fall spawners may be at greater risk because of shallow egg burial depths and increased rain-on-snow events during their incubation period. Scour risk for all species is reduced when changes in channel morphology (width, depth, and grain size) keep pace with climate-driven changes in streamflow. Although climate change is predicted to increase scour magnitude, the frequency of scouring events relative to typical salmonid life cycles is relatively low, indicating that individual year classes may be impacted by critical scour, but extirpation of entire populations is not expected. Furthermore, refugia are predicted to occur in unconfined portions of the stream network, where scouring shear stresses are limited to bankfull stage because overbank flows spread across alluvial floodplains; conversely, confined valleys will likely exacerbate climate-driven changes in flow and scour. Our approach can be used to prioritize management strategies according to relative risk to different species or spatial distributions of risk and can be used to predict temporal shifts in the spatial distribution of suitable spawning habitats. A critical unknown issue is whether biological adaptation can keep pace with rates of climate change and channel response.

We developed a hydrologic landscape (HL) classification approach that describes factors of climate-watershed systems that control the hydrologic characteristics of watersheds. Our assessment units are incremental watersheds (i.e., headwater watersheds or areas draining directly into stream reaches). Major components of the classification include indices of annual climate, climate seasonality, aquifer permeability, terrain, and soil permeability. To evaluate the usefulness of our approach, we identified 30 rivers with long-term streamflow-gauging records and without major diversions and impoundments. We used statistical clustering to group the streams based on the shapes of their annual hydrographs. Comparison of the streamflow clusters and HL distributions within river basin clusters shows that the Oregon HL approach has the ability to provide insights about the expected hydrologic behavior of HLs and larger river basins. The Oregon HL approach has potential to be a useful framework for comparing hydrologic attributes of streams and rivers in the Pacific Northwest.",2013,Engineering; Geology; Water Resources,Article,hydrologic classification; hydrologic cycle; watersheds; rivers; streams; runoff; geospatial analysis,web_of_science,Yes,,,,,,

We tested the ecological resilience-capacity of headwater ecosystems to sustain streamflow under climate change-and the engineering resilience-capacity of dam and reservoir management to overprint a climate change signal-in seven sub-basins of the Columbia River from 1950 to 2011. Sub-basins had a headwater gauge above dams with a long-term streamflow record and a nearby climate station with a long-term record of air temperature and precipitation, as well as matching long-term streamflow records at gauges downstream of dams. Trends were fitted to daily data for maximum and minimum temperature, precipitation, and streamflow over the period of record (mostly 1950-2011). Consistent with predicted streamflow response to climate warming, annual snowmelt runoff peaks in five of seven headwater basins shifted to a few days earlier over the period 1950 to 2010, but the changes were small, displaying ecological resilience. Below dams, streamflow change was attributable to reservoir operation for flood control (reduced annual peak flows) and irrigation (augmented late summer low flows), as well as flow management for hydropower, navigation, and recreation, but predicted streamflow responses to climate change were absent, indicating engineering resilience.

The purpose of this research was to quantify spatiotemporal patterns of meadow invasion; and how climate, larger landforms, topography, and overstory trees have interactively influenced tree invasion. We combined airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) characterizations of landforms, topography, and overstory vegetation with historical climate, field measurements of snow depth, tree abundance, and tree ages to reconstruct spatial and temporal patterns of tree invasion over five decades in a subalpine meadow complex in the Oregon Cascade Range, USA. Proportion of meadow occupied by trees increased from 8 % in 1950 to 35 % in 2007. Larger landforms, topography, and tree canopies interactively mediated regional climatic controls of tree invasion by modifying depth and persistence of snow pack, while tree canopies also influenced seed source availability. Landscape context played an important role mediating snow depth and tree invasion; on glacial landforms tree invasion was negatively associated with spring snowfall, but on debris flows tree invasion was not associated with snow fall.

For example, in the Oregon Cascades mountain range, geology, vegetation, and climate influence the hydrologic connections within watersheds. Geology determines which watersheds are surface runoff-dominated and which are groundwater-dominated. In this Mediterranean climate with dry summers, surface runoff watersheds will consistently experience near-zero late summer discharge, so declining snowpacks will have little effect on low flows. This contrasts with groundwater-dominated watersheds, where a shift from snow to rain or a decline in precipitation will reduce recharge, thereby reducing late summer groundwater contributions to streamflow. Earlier snowmelt causes forests to transpire earlier, resulting in decreased springtime streamflow. Reduced snowpacks lead to soil moisture stress, making forests more vulnerable to extensive wildfires and affecting the lifespan and composition of forests. Monitoring and quantifying these complex linkages and feedbacks require appropriate measurement networks. Sampling strategies often use watershed typology to identify where measurements should be focused. Such an approach should include not only established watershed classification parameters such as topology and geology but also interannual climate variability and land cover. As concerns of water scarcity and vulnerability move to the forefront, our watershed classifications should be extended to include ecosystem and social-ecological parameters. An integrated and agent-based modeling scheme called Envision has been developed to simulate alternative future landscapes at the watershed scale. Using fully coupled models of hydrology, ecosystems, and socioeconomics, decision-makers can simulate the effects of policy decisions in conjunction with other climate forcing, land use change, and economic disturbances.

However, predictions of future changes in snow hydrology and water supply from mountain basins are complicated by natural variability in climate and interactions among topography, vegetation structure, wind and radiation energy, and snow deposition. In this study, interannual variability in snow-cover development, snow melt, and runoff is assessed for a range of precipitation and temperature conditions typical of a mountain catchment, the Reynolds Mountain East (RME) basin, in Idaho. A spatially distributed energy and mass balance snow model, Isnobal, coupled with a windfield and snow redistribution model, is used to continuously simulate snow accumulation and melt for five individual snow seasons (1984, 1986, 1987, 2001, and 2006), representing the historic range of climatic variance. The modeling results compare well with the field measurements of snow water equivalent for all simulation snow seasons (Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient of 0.81 to 0.97). The modeling scheme used in this study demonstrates spatial and temporal differences in snow-cover development and melt processes in complex mountain terrain. During all simulation snow seasons, the forested site was shown to hold more snow, generate more snowmelt, and melt later than the exposed site of the basin. Comparison of simulation results for wet and dry snow seasons showed that the snow melts earlier and a greater fraction of surface water input (SWI) is utilized to fill soil water storage during dry seasons than in wet snow seasons. This study demonstrates differences in snowmelt volume and timing during wet and dry seasons within a mountain basin. It will improve understanding of how interannual variability affects the delivery of water from the seasonal snowcover to the soil and streams of mountain basins, and can provide useful inputs to the decision-making process for reservoir and water management strategies for utilizing surplus or supplementing deficit water supplies during wet and dry years, respectively.

G.",Small soil storage capacity limits benefit of winter snowpack to upland vegetation,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"In the western United States, the mountain snowpack is an important natural reservoir that extends spring and summer water delivery to downstream users and ecosystems. The importance of winter snow accumulation to upland ecosystems is not as clearly defined. This study investigates the relative contribution of winter precipitation to upland spring and summer soil moisture storage and availability in a semi-arid mountainous watershed. At this site, coarse soil textures and shallow soil depths limit soil storage capacity to 616?cm. Winter precipitation exceeds soil storage capacity by 2.5 times. Accordingly, soil moisture profiles at most locations in the watershed reach field capacity in early winter. With soil storage near capacity, water released by snowmelt primarily contributes to deep drainage and makes a limited contribution to the soil moisture reservoir. Water that is retained by the soil after the snowpack melts is lost to evapotranspiration in as little as 10?days. In contrast, spring precipitation extends moist soil conditions by up to 90?days into the warm season, when ecological water demand is highest. These field observations suggest that changes in spring precipitation, not winter snowpack, may have the greater impact on upland ecosystems in this environment. Furthermore, because winter precipitation is in excess compared to the soil storage capacity, soil moisture availability may be fairly insensitive to climate change-induced transitions from snow to rain.

We employ the entire model chain from global and regional climate models, station-based statistical downscaling, and a fully distributed, physically based hydrologic model and verify the results against observed streamflow. The performance is model dependent but is generally encouraging enough to justify the application of the climate scenarios. A general warming of about 2 degrees C is projected and, on average, slightly drier conditions, especially in late summer. We find evidence that the projected changes are elevation dependent and relatively small scale, with decreasing signals with higher elevations. All models project a shift of the hydrograph toward a more rain-fed regime, with peak flows occurring in June instead of July. Annual peak flow is projected to not increase, and August low flow decreases in all four models. With nonshrinking (static) glaciers, relatively high melting rates are simulated for August and September that partly compensate for the shifted hydrograph; this enhanced glacier melt is also detected in simulated historic Columbia headwater flow.

Results for three species (Abies amabilis, Callitropsis nootkatensis, Tsuga mertensiana) whose upper limits occur at treeline (>1600 m) imply climatic controls on upper range limits, with low growth in cold and high snowpack years.

Location High-elevation forests in south-west Montana, central Idaho, eastern and western Oregon, USA. Methods Stand inventory and dendroecological methods were used to assess stand structure and composition and to reconstruct forest history at sixty 0.1-ha plots. Patterns of blister rust infection and mountain pine beetle-caused mortality in whitebark pine trees were examined using nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA, Mann-Whitney U-tests, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov two-sample tests. Stepwise regression was used to build models of blister rust infection and mountain pine beetle-related mortality rates based on a suite of biophysical site variables. Results Occurrence of blister rust infections was significantly different among the mountain ranges, with a general gradient of decreasing blister rust occurrence from east to west. Evidence of mountain pine beetle-caused mortality was identified on 83% of all dead whitebark pine trees and was relatively homogenous across the study area. Blister rust infected trees of all ages and sizes uniformly, while mountain pine beetles infested older, larger trees at all sites.

This dependence varies within and between populations due to variation among individuals that is fixed within a life stage (giving rise to what we call persistent variation) and variation from random effects within a life stage (giving rise to what we call random variation). It is important to understand how both types of variation affect phenology if we are to predict the effects of climate change on insect populations. We present three nested phenology models incorporating increasing levels of variation. First, we derive an advection equation to describe the temperature-dependent development of a population with no variation in development time. This model is extended to incorporate persistent variation by introducing a developmental phenotype that varies within a population, yielding a phenotype-dependent advection equation. This is further extended by including a diffusion term describing random variation in a phenotype-dependent Fokker-Planck development equation. These models are also novel because they are formulated in terms of development time rather than developmental rate; development time can be measured directly in the laboratory, whereas developmental rate is calculated by transforming laboratory data. We fit the phenology models to development time data for mountain pine beetles (MPB) (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins [Coleoptera: Scolytidae]) held at constant temperatures in laboratory experiments. The nested models are parameterized using a maximum likelihood approach. The results of the parameterization show that the phenotype-dependent advection model provides the best fit to laboratory data, suggesting that MPB phenology may be adequately described in terms of persistent variation alone.

New spatial statistical models that account for network topology were parameterized with these data and explained 93% and 86% of the variation in mean stream temperatures and maximas, respectively. During our study period, basin average mean stream temperatures increased by 0.38 degrees C (0.27 degrees C/decade), and maximas increased by 0.48 degrees C (0.34 degrees C/decade), primarily due to long-term (30-50 year) trends in air temperatures and stream flows. Radiation increases from wildfires accounted for 9% of basin-scale temperature increases, despite burning 14% of the basin. Within wildfire perimeters, however, stream temperature increases were 2-3 times greater than basin averages, and radiation gains accounted for 50% of warming. Thermal habitat for rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) was minimally affected by temperature increases, except for small shifts towards higher elevations. Bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus), in contrast, were estimated to have lost 11-20% (8-16%/decade) of the headwater stream lengths that were cold enough for spawning and early juvenile rearing, with the largest losses occurring in the coldest habitats. Our results suggest that a warming climate has begun to affect thermal conditions in streams and that impacts to biota will be specific to both species and context. Where species are at risk, conservation actions should be guided based on considerations of restoration opportunity and future climatic effects. To refine predictions based on thermal effects, more work is needed to understand mechanisms associated with biological responses, climate effects on other habitat features, and habitat configurations that confer population resilience.",2010,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Article,"Boise River basin, Idaho, USA; bull trout; climate change; global warming; Oncorhynchus mykiss; patch; rainbow trout; Salvelinus confluentus; spatial statistical model; stream temperature; thermal habitat; wildfire",web_of_science,Yes,,,,,,

H.",On glacier retreat and drought cycles in the Rocky Mountains of Montana and Canada,QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL,"The enigma of why mountain glacier started to retreat in the 1850s in the Rocky Mountains and elsewhere remains unresolved. The most important factor affecting climate change presumably was a change in the mode of operation of the sun one or two decades earlier (from irregular periodicity and low output to regular periods and greater brightness). But the direct cause appears to have been the onset of drought in the 1830s. Interestingly, there is no obvious solar information in the drought narrative in Montana and southwestern Canada. The presence of tidal lines in the spectrum of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, together with the presence of lines that could be interpreted as beat periods between solar and tidal forcing in the drought series, suggests that the energy of solar variation is preempted for interference with tidal forcing, within the system of oscillations informing precipitation patterns in the region. The suggestion is supported by the presence of a strikingly dominant 12.5-year period in the drought series, which is interpreted as a difference tone between the main sunspot cycle (at 10.8) and a tidal period at 5.8. Also, this period is close to 2/3 of the nodal tide (at 18.61). (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

In the context of managed flood control, these systematic changes are likely to disrupt the balance between flood control and reservoir refill in existing reservoir systems. To adapt to these hydrologic changes, refill timing and evacuation requirements for flood control need to be modified. This work poses a significant systems engineering problem, especially for large, multiobjective water systems. An existing optimization/simulation procedure is refined for rebalancing flood control and refill objectives for the Columbia River Basin for anticipated global warming. To calibrate the optimization model for the 20th century flow, the objective function is tuned to reproduce the current reliability of reservoir refill, while providing comparable levels of flood control to those produced by current flood control practices. After the optimization model is calibrated using the 20th century flow the same objective function is used to develop flood control curves for a global warming scenario which assumes an approximately 2 C increase in air temperature. Robust decreases in system storage deficits are simulated for the climate change scenario when optimized flood rule curves replace the current flood control curves, without increasing monthly flood risks.",2009,Engineering; Water Resources,Article,NA,web_of_science,Yes,,,,,,

During outbreaks, the resulting widespread tree mortality reduces forest carbon uptake and increases future emissions from the decay of killed trees. The impacts of insects on forest carbon dynamics, however, are generally ignored in large- scale modelling analyses. The current outbreak in British Columbia, Canada, is an order of magnitude larger in area and severity than all previous recorded outbreaks(4). Here we estimate that the cumulative impact of the beetle outbreak in the affected region during 2000 - 2020 will be 270 megatonnes ( Mt) carbon ( or 36 g carbon m(-2) yr(-1) on average over 374,000 km 2 of forest). This impact converted the forest from a small net carbon sink to a large net carbon source both during and immediately after the outbreak. In the worst year, the impacts resulting from the beetle outbreak in British Columbia were equivalent to similar to 75% of the average annual direct forest fire emissions from all of Canada during 1959 - 1999. The resulting reduction in net primary production was of similar magnitude to increases observed during the 1980s and 1990s as a result of global change(5). Climate change has contributed to the unprecedented extent and severity of this outbreak(6). Insect outbreaks such as this represent an important mechanism by which climate change may undermine the ability of northern forests to take up and store atmospheric carbon, and such impacts should be accounted for in large- scale modelling analyses.",2008,Science & Technology - Other Topics,Article,NA,web_of_science,Yes,,,,,,

Bull trout Salvelinus confluentus may be especially vulnerable to climate change given that spawning and early rearing are constrained by cold water temperatures creating a patchwork of natal headwater habitats across river networks. Because the size and connectivity of patches also appear to influence the persistence of local populations, climate warming could lead to increasing fragmentation of remaining habitats and accelerated decline of this species. We modeled the relationships between (1) the lower elevation limits of small bull trout and mean annual air temperature and (2) latitude and longitude across the species' potential range within the interior Columbia River basin of the USA. We used our results to explore the implications of the climate warming expected in the next 50 or more years. We found a strong association between the lower elevation limits of bull trout distributions and longitude and latitude; this association was consistent with the patterns in mean annual air temperature. We concluded that climate does strongly influence regional and local bull trout distributions, and we estimated bull trout habitat response to a range of predicted climate warming effects. Warming over the range predicted could result in losses of 18-92% of thermally suitable natal habitat area and 27-99% of large (>10,000-ha) habitat patches, which suggests that population impacts may be disproportionate to the simple loss of habitat area. The predicted changes were not uniform across the species' range, and some populations appear to face higher risks than others.

Understanding foraging ecology for a wide-ranging carnivore such as the wolverine is important, particularly because reproduction has been demonstrated to be closely linked to food abundance. Wolverine diet was shown to vary regionally and seasonally. Regional variation was related to differences in prey availability between study areas. Moose Alces alces, caribou Rangifer tarandus, and hoary marmots Marmota caligata were abundant and common prey items within both study areas. Mountain goats Oreamnos americanus and porcupine Erithizon dorsatum were more abundant and more frequent prey items in the Columbia Mountains, while snowshoe hare Lepus americanus and beaver Castor canadensis were more abundant and more frequent prey items in the Omineca Mountains.

We examined two case studies: Cle Elum River, Washington, and Chattahoochee-Apalachicola River Basin, Georgia and Florida. These rivers had available downscaled global circulation model (GCM) data and allowed us to analyse the effects of future climate scenarios on rivers with (1) different hydrographs, (2) high future water demands, and (3) a river-floodplain system. We compared observed flow regimes to those predicted under future climate scenarios to describe the extent and type of changes predicted to occur. Daily stream flow under future climate scenarios was created by either statistically downscaling GCMs (Cle Elum) or creating a regression model between climatological parameters predicted from GCMs and stream flow (Chattahoochee-Apalachicola). Flow regimes were examined for changes from current conditions with respect to ecologically relevant features including the magnitude and timing of minimum and maximum flows. The Cie Elum's hydrograph under future climate scenarios showed a dramatic shift in the timing of peak flows and lower low flow of a longer duration. These changes could mean higher summer water temperatures, lower summer dissolved oxygen, and reduced survival of larval fishes. The Chattahoochee-Apalachicola basin is heavily impacted by dams and water withdrawals for human consumption; therefore, we made comparisons between pre-large dam conditions, current conditions, current conditions with future demand, and future climate scenarios with future demand to separate climate change effects and other anthropogenic impacts. Dam construction, future climate, and future demand decreased the flow variability of the river. In addition, minimum flows were lower under future climate scenarios. These changes could decrease the connectivity of the channel and the floodplain, decrease habitat availability, and potentially lower the ability of the river to assimilate wastewater treatment plant effluent.

These fires are usually attributed to increased stand density as a result of fire suppression, grazing and other land use, and are often considered uncharacteristic or unprecedented(1-3). Tree-ring records from the past 500 years indicate that before Euro-American settlement, frequent, low-severity fires maintained open stands(1-3). However, the pre-settlement period between about AD 1500 and AD 1900 was also generally colder than present(5-10), raising the possibility that rapid twentieth-century warming promoted recent catastrophic fires. Here we date fire-related sediment deposits in alluvial fans in central Idaho to reconstruct Holocene fire history in xeric ponderosa pine forests and examine links to climate. We find that colder periods experienced frequent low-severity fires, probably fuelled by increased understory growth. Warmer periods experienced severe droughts, stand-replacing fires and large debris-flow events that comprise a large component of long-term erosion(11) and coincide with similar events in sub-alpine forests of Yellowstone National Park(12).

A major realization is that accumulated physiological stress can ultimately lead to tree mortality and changes in species distributions, particularly in areas away from maritime influences. To ameliorate the effects of drought, insect outbreaks, and reduce the risk of crown fires, various strategies are being tested. To make some of these strategies economical, biomass is proposed as an alternative energy source. At the same time that an increase in harvesting is being considered, there is a desire to increase carbon sequestration by forests to offset, at least in part, greenhouse gas emissions.

Understanding potential future vegetation changes in these regions requires methods that can resolve vegetation responses to climate change at fine spatial resolutions. We used LPJ, a dynamic global vegetation model, to assess potential future vegetation changes for a large topographically complex area of the northwest United States and southwest Canada (38.0-58.0 degrees N latitude by 136.6-103.0 degrees W longitude). LPJ is a process-based vegetation model that mechanistically simulates the effect of changing climate and atmospheric CO2 concentrations on vegetation. It was developed and has been mostly applied at spatial resolutions of 10-minutes or coarser. In this study, we used LPJ at a 30-second (similar to 1-km) spatial resolution to simulate potential vegetation changes for 2070-2099.

Variability in snow cover within mountainous regions of the Pacific Northwest, USA is attributable to a combination of anthropogenic climate change and climate oscillations. However, snow covered areas can be heterogeneous and patchy, requiring more detailed mapping of snow trends to understand their potential influences on montane forests. We used standard daily MODIS snow products (MOD10A1.5) to investigate the 15-year record (2000-2014) of snow cover in the predominant forest ecotone of the Oregon Western Cascades. We modeled the ecotone using field data from the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest, and only considered forested MODIS Terra pixels located within the mapped ecotone of a five-county region. Three snow cover metrics were developed using both binary and fractional snow cover data: mean ecotone snow cover percent, number of snow covered days during the melt season, and day of snow disappearance. Snow cover and depletion dates exhibited large interannual variability and no significant linear trends. This variability is likely influenced by the preceding wintertime states of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the El Nino/Southem Oscillation (ENSO), which tend to covary. We improve and generalize existing methods for power analysis of trend estimation and quantify the number of uninterrupted observations of the snow metrics that would be needed to distinguish trends of different magnitudes from noise variance, taking possible autocorrelation into account. Sensitivity analyses of the results to some of our heuristic choices are conducted, and challenges associated with optical remote sensing of snow in a dense montane forest are discussed.

Because of their unique biology, lichens are very sensitive bioindicators of air quality. Lichens lack a cuticle to control absorption or leaching of nutrients and they dynamically concentrate nutrients roughly in proportion to the abundance in the atmosphere. As N deposition increases, nitrogen-loving eutrophic lichens become dominant over oligotrophic lichens that thrive in nutrient-poor habitats. We capitalize on these characteristics to develop two lichen-based indicators of air-borne and depositional N for interior forested mountain ecosystems of the Pacific Northwest and calibrate them with N concentration measured in PM2.5 at 12 IMPROVE air quality monitoring sites in the study area. The two lichen indices and peak frequencies of individual species exhibited continuous relationships with inorganic N pollution throughout the range of N in ambient PM2.5, suggesting that the designation of a critical level or critical load is somewhat arbitrary because at any level above background, some species are likely to experience adverse impacts. The concentration of N in PM2.5 near the city of Spokane, Washington was the lowest measured at an instrumented monitoring site near known N pollution sources. This level, 0.37 mu g/m(3)/year, served as a critical level, corresponding to a concentration of 1.02% N in the lichen Letharia vulpina, which is similar to the upper end of background lichen N concentrations measured elsewhere in the western United States. Based on this level, we estimate critical loads to be 1.54 and 2.51 kg/ha/year of through-fall dissolved inorganic N deposition for lichen communities and lichen N concentration, respectively. We map estimated fine-particulate (PM2.5) N in ambient air based on lichen community and lichen N concentration indices to identify hotspots in the region. We also develop and map an independent lichen community-based bioclimatic index, which is strongly related to gradients in moisture availability and temperature variability.

The Point Arena subspecies (A. r. nigra) is federally listed as endangered and is 1 of 2 subspecies that have extremely small and disjunct distributions, putting the taxon at risk from habitat loss and warming global temperatures. We sought to understand their range-wide distribution, to predict the environmental features that best describe their occurrence, and to establish a foundation for monitoring their distribution. We randomly sampled the occurrence of Point Arena mountain beavers (PAMB) from the portion of their geographic range that was accessible (public lands plus private lands where permission was granted). We surveyed 127, 25-ha sample units for their distinctive burrows and estimated the probability of detecting burrows, if they were present, at >90% per visit. Using this information, we estimated occupancy across the accessible portion of the range to be 26.2%. Range-wide estimates of occupancy, combined with strategically selected locations where abundance and survival can be estimated noninvasively, may comprise a realistic monitoring program for this taxon. We also used the detection and nondetection locations to develop a habitat suitability model by relating these locations to remotely sensed predictors. We evaluated 53 a priori candidate habitat suitability models and the best-fitting model included gentle slopes, low terrain roughness indices, and the high density of rivers and streams. Selecting the probability value that best separated the sample units into suitable and nonsuitable habitat, we estimated a total of 70.5 km(2) of suitable habit, or approximately 40.4% of the original geographic range. New detections significantly expanded the known geographic range, moderating concerns about habitat loss, including that predicted by climate change. A substantial number of suitable areas were predicted to occur outside the current range. The identification of high suitability areas allows management agencies to prioritize areas for PAMB conservation planning, evaluate human impacts on habitat, and evaluate how a changing climate may affect distribution.",2015,Zoology,Article,Aplodontia; California; habitat; modeling; mountain beaver; occupancy; Point Arena,web_of_science,Yes,,,,,,

Regional context, notably the spatial complexity of climatic gradients, may influence species migration potential. While high-elevation species may benefit from steep climate gradients in mountain regions, their persistence may be threatened by limited suitable habitat as land area decreases with elevation. To untangle these apparently contradictory predictions for mountainous regions, we evaluated the climatic suitability of four coniferous forest tree species of the western United States based on species distribution modeling (SDM) and examined changes in climatically suitable areas under predicted climate change. We used forest structural information relating to tree species dominance, productivity, and demography from an extensive forest inventory system to assess the strength of inferences made with a SDM approach. We found that tree species dominance, productivity, and recruitment were highest where climatic suitability (i.e., probability of species occurrence under certain climate conditions) was high, supporting the use of predicted climatic suitability in examining species risk to climate change. By predicting changes in climatic suitability over the next century, we found that climatic suitability will likely decline, both in areas currently occupied by each tree species and in nearby unoccupied areas to which species might migrate in the future. These trends were most dramatic for high elevation species. Climatic changes predicted over the next century will dramatically reduce climatically suitable areas for high-elevation tree species while a lower elevation species, Pinus ponderosa, will be well positioned to shift upslope across the region. Reductions in suitable area for high-elevation species imply that even unlimited migration would be insufficient to offset predicted habitat loss, underscoring the vulnerability of these high-elevation species to climatic changes.",NA,NA,Article,upslope migration; climate change; demography; productivity; tree species; suitability; dominance; forest inventory and analysis,web_of_science,Yes,,,,,,

Here we use a simple numerical model to evaluate the response of orographic precipitation to surface warming under idealized conditions representative of the strongest orographic storms. We find an upward shift in the pattern of condensation with warming, caused by larger fractional changes in condensation at low temperature and amplified warming aloft. As a result, the distribution of precipitation shifts downwind, causing larger fractional changes in precipitation on the lee slope than on the windward slope. Total precipitation is found to increase by a smaller fraction than near-surface water vapor, in contrast to expected changes in other types of extreme precipitation.

The pattern analysis at the provincial level reveals that the 1980s outbreak did not crash as originally thought. The current outbreak is most likely a result of the progressive buildup of the epidemic infestations during the transition period (1985-1995) under favourable weather conditions and substantially improved host resources. This is also true for the Northeast and Cariboo areas of the province specifically, even though the infestations in the Cariboo area remained at incipient-epidemic levels during the transition period after the 1980s outbreak crashed in 1985. In the Southeast area, the current outbreak apparently continued from the outbreak that initiated in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The 1980s outbreak originated from multiple spatially separate locations whereas the current outbreak initiated from a single location in Tweedsmuir Provincial Park. The centralized and self-amplifying buildup of the current outbreak implicates at least three substantial expansions that occurred in 2002, 2006, and 2008. This study suggests that at the provincial level, as well as for the Northeast and Southeast areas of the province, the current outbreak is declining but most likely will continue for many years given the ongoing and future warming climate and a large proportion of pines that remain in the habitats of mountain pine beetles. This study also suggests that dispersals, particularly long-distance dispersal, may play a key role in driving the spread and expansion of the current outbreak although uncertainty remains due to the local dynamics of the beetle populations.",2014,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Article,NA,web_of_science,Yes,,,,,,

Yet few studies have assessed long-term wind speed trends for alpine regions or how such trends could influence snow transport and distribution. Alpine-region meteorological stations are sparsely distributed, and their records are short. To increase spatial and temporal coverage, use of modeled data is appealing, but the level of agreement between modeled and in situ data is unknown for alpine regions. Data agreement, temporal trends, and the potential effects on snow distribution were evaluated using two in situ sites in an alpine region [Niwot Ridge in Colorado and the Glacier Lakes Ecological Experiments Station (GLEES) in Wyoming] and the corresponding grid cells of the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR). Temperature, precipitation, and wind speed variables were used to assess blowing-snow trends at annual, seasonal, and daily scales. The correlation between NARR and in situ datasets showed that temperature data were correlated but that wind speed and precipitation were not. NARR wind speed data were systematically lower when compared with in situ data, yet the frequency of wind events was captured. Overall, there were not many significant differences between NARR and in situ wind speed trends at annual, seasonal, and daily scales, aside from GLEES daily values. This finding held true even when trends presented opposite signatures and slopes, which was likely a result of low trend slopes.

These data sets were derived from a variety of fish sampling techniques, including weirs, screw traps, redd counts, daytime snorkeling, electrofishing, and angler creel. Bull Trout populations in Idaho were relatively stable prior to 1994, but after 1994, substantially more population growth rates trended statistically upward (n = 14) than downward (n = 3). Average intrinsic rates of population change were 0.01 (SE = 0.03) prior to 1994 and 0.07 (SE = 0.02) after 1994; across all years of data, the rate of change averaged 0.07 (SE = 0.02). Fifty-nine percent of the data sets had zero to minimal observation error according to Gompertz state-space model estimates; observation error was least common in data from screw traps and redd counts and most common in snorkel data. Gompertz-type density-dependent models were most often the best-fitting models for Bull Trout population growth. Moreover, few of the most reliable modeling results (i.e., those from data sets estimated to have zero to minimal observation error) contained a period effect or time (i.e., year) effect, suggesting that carrying capacity generally did not differ between the pre-1994 and post-1994 periods and generally was not trending positively or negatively through time. Parametric bootstraps predicted that the mean probability of falling below the quasi-extinction level of 20 adults in the next 30years was 9.8% (median = 4.7%) for data sets estimated to have zero to minimal observation error. The weight of evidence from our modeling results suggests that for most Bull Trout populations in Idaho, abundance is stable or increasing and the risk of extirpation in the foreseeable future is low.

The snowmelt schemes have been tested with a point measurement dataset at the Cotton Creek Experimental Watershed (CCEW) in British Columbia, Canada and with a detailed dataset available from the Dranse de Ferret catchment, an extensively monitored catchment in the Swiss Alps. The snowmelt model performance is quantified with the use of a spatially-explicit model of the hydrologic response. Comparative analyses are presented with the widely-known, grid-based method proposed by Hock which combines a local, temperature-index approach with potential radiation. The results suggest that a simple diurnal cycle of the degree-day melt parameter based on minimum and maximum temperatures is competitive with the Hock approach for sub-daily melt simulations. Advantages of the new extension of the classical degree-day method over other temperature-index methods include its use of physically-based, diurnal variations and its ability to be adapted to data-constrained hydrological models which are lumped in some nature.

We found that periodic annual increment (PAI) of diameter, basal area (BA), volume, and aboveground dry mass were significantly related to stand density index (SDI) and stand age at start of the period; the quadratic trends varied among sites. Precipitation departure from the normal for each period explained a significant amount of residual variation in all PAI variables except diameter. BA production did not change significantly as SDI exceeded 270 trees.ha(-1) at the OR sites and 320 trees.ha(-1) at the CA site. Stand productivity was the highest at Elliot Ranch (CA) and the least at Blue Mountains (OR). A similar trend held in growth efficiency under lower stand densities (SDI < 600).

The goal of this study is to predict the potential effects of future climate change on population connectivity and genetic diversity of American marten populations across a 30.2 million hectare region of the in the US northern Rocky Mountains. We use a landscape resistance model validated from empirical landscape genetics modeling to predict the current and expected future extent and fragmentation of American marten dispersal habitat under five climate change scenarios, corresponding to climatic warming of between 0.7 and 3.3 A degrees C, consistent with expected climate change by year 2080. We predict the regions of the current and future landscapes where gene flow is expected to be governed by isolation by distance and the regions where population fragmentation is expected to limit gene flow. Finally, we predict changes in the strength and location of predicted movement corridors, fracture zones and the location of dispersal barriers across the study area in each scenario. We found that under the current climate, gene flow is predicted to be limited primarily by distance (isolation), and landscape structure does not significantly limit gene flow, resulting in very high genetic diversity over most of the study area. Projected climatic warming substantially reduces the extent and increases the fragmentation of marten populations in the western and northwestern parts of the study area. In contrast, climate change is not predicted to fragment the extensive higher elevation mountain massifs in central Idaho, the northern U.S. continental divide, and Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.

Location The contiguous United States west of the eastern border of the Rocky Mountains (103.77 degrees W). Methods Museum records of 67 mammalian species from two time periods (190039 and 19702009), mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation are used to model historic and modern distributions. For each era the region outside each species' range in the opposing era is assigned to zones of range limitation: temperature alone is prohibitive, moisture alone is prohibitive, both preclude the species, or both have values that alone are within the species' tolerance range but in combination are outside its climatic niche (interaction' limitation). The relative importance of each type of limitation is estimated by their intersection with regions of range contraction and expansion. Results Averaged across species, 82 +/- 3% (+/- SE) of the areas of contraction are now occupied by interaction limitation, and 74 +/- 5% of areas expanded into were historically occupied by similar zones. In comparison, areas of range shift in which just temperature or moisture acting alone would have excluded the species comprise between only 9 and 17%, and areas in which both factors are limiting are negligible. Expansions into and contractions from regions of interaction limitation occurred more often than expected by chance given the distribution of this type of limitation in the wider study region.

Warming since the 1850s, increases in annual mean temperature of at least 2 degrees C between 2000 and 2050 are highly probable. Annual mean temperatures across the Canadian boreal zone could be 4-5 degrees C warmer than today's by 2100. All aspects of boreal forest ecosystem function are likely to be affected. Further, several potential ""tipping elements"" - where exposure to increasing changes in climate may trigger distinct shifts in ecosystem state - can be identified across the Canadian boreal zone. Approximately 40% of the forested area is underlain by permafrost, some of which is already degrading irreversibly, triggering a process of forest decline and re-establishment lasting several decades, while also releasing significant quantities of greenhouse gases that will amplify the future global warming trend. Warmer temperatures coupled with significant changes in the distribution and timing of annual precipitation are likely to cause serious tree-killing droughts in the west; east of the Great Lakes, however, where precipitation is generally nonlimiting, warming coupled with increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide may stimulate higher forest productivity. Large wildfires, which can cause serious economic losses, are expected to become more frequent, but increases in mean annual area burned will be relatively gradual. The most immediate threats could come from endemic forest insect pests that have the potential for population outbreaks in response to relatively small temperature increases. Quantifying the multiple effects of climate change will be challenging, particularly because there are great uncertainties attached to possible interactions among them, as well as with other land-use pressures.

The melt model is applied to all of the glaciers in the Illecillewaet River basin for the summers of 2009 to 2011. Modelled glacier runoff for the three years has an average value of 112 +/- 12 x 10(6) m(3), approximately 10% of Illecillewaet River yields for 2009 to 2011. Glaciers contributed 25% to August flows for the three years.

The study focusses on two characteristics of stream temperature: the thermal regime, defined as the pattern of seasonal and spatial stream temperature variation in a stream, and the thermal sensitivity, considered here to be the slope of the stream-air temperature relationship. The baseflow index, or degree of groundwater influence in a stream, is hypothesized to be an important regional control of both thermal regime and thermal sensitivity. Weekly stream temperatures were calculated and evaluated at 104 primarily unregulated sites that were geographically distributed across the region. Air temperature and streamflow explained an average of 94% of the variance in annual thermal regimes and 68% of the variance in August thermal regimes at individual sites. Regression results showed that thermal sensitivity to increasing air temperatures was less in summer than at other times of the year. Future climate projections of summer stream temperature, based on thermal sensitivities, are small in comparison to the range of summer stream temperatures that exist across the region. This observation highlights the need to understand summer thermal regimes as well as summer thermal sensitivities when assessing climate change impacts to regional stream temperatures. Multiple regression analysis identified several landscape factors and stream characteristics that explained summer stream temperatures and thermal sensitivities regionally. Two of the most important factors were baseflow index and stream channel slope. Lastly, the summer stream/air temperature ratio of a stream may be useful in assessing existing or expected stream temperature conditions at a site in relation to these factors or in identifying unique environmental conditions or potential restoration needs at a site.

Because the stable isotope composition of precipitation can vary geographically, variation in the stable isotope composition of river water may be able to identify source water dynamics. We monitored the stable isotope values (delta O-18 and delta H-2) of river and stream water within the southern Willamette River Basin in western Oregon over two years. Within this basin, eighty-four percent of the isotopic variation in small tributary streams was explained by the mean elevation of the catchments, whereas seasonal variation was minimal. However, water within the Willamette River had distinct isotopic seasonal patterns that likely occurred because of changes in the mean elevation of source water for the river. River isotopic values were lowest during summer low flow and highest during February/March when snow accumulated in the mountains. We estimated that the mean elevation of the source water for the Willamette River shifted over 700 m, seasonally. During winter when rain occurred in the valley and snow accumulated in the mountains, the river reflected a mixture of low mountains and valley bottom precipitation. During the dry Mediterranean summer, 60-80% of the river water came from the snow zone above 1200 m, which is only 12% of the land area and accounts for 15.6% of the annual precipitation within the Willamette Basin. This high elevation area contains the High Cascades geological region with highly permeable bedrock that sustains late-summer baseflow compared to the Western Cascades with low permeable bedrock.

Climate change models consistently predict snow depth declines across the Northern Hemisphere. Snow depth has been linked to the demography of numerous species, and snow depth reduction is expected to affect the demography of some northern species. As many demographic studies depend on long-term population data that extend back beyond available sources of spatially continuous snow depth data, reliable hindcasting of snow depth surface maps is needed. 2. We developed a two-stage regression modelling approach to reconstructing historic snow depths using an existing and readily available spatiotemporal data set of daily meteorological variables across a large, heterogeneous landscape in North America from 1982 to 2003. The final model accounted for ecoregional differences and predicted snow depth as a function of elevation and total snowfall accumulation. 3. Model validations showed that the estimated snow depths were spatially and temporally accurate. 4. We demonstrate how to apply this model with ArcGIS to hindcast monthly and yearly sequences of high-resolution, spatially continuous surfaces of historic snow depths. We also illustrate the utility of the modelled snow depth surfaces for informing predictions of how changes in snow depth may influence the demography and habitats of snow-dependent and snow-restricted species by assessing the spatiotemporal stochasticity of snow conditions that potentially benefit wolverine Gulo gulo and the winter ranges, net energy costs and population growth of mule deer Odocoileus hemionus. 5.

Reducing non-climate stressors and securing protection for large, complex landscapes are important long-term actions to alleviate climate change impacts on biodiversity. Equally important is the immediate protection of a network of climate change microrefugia, particularly old growth and intact forests on north-facing slopes and in canyon bottoms, lower- and middle-elevations, wetter coastal mountains, and along elevational gradients. Such areas provide local opportunities for vulnerable species to persist within the ecoregion. We identify a provisional set of 22 highest-priority and 40 high-priority microrefugia that occur mostly outside of existing protected areas and along wetter and lower elevations of the ecoregion. Proposed reserve designs, if fully implemented, would capture most of the recommended microrefugia, although we found 11 important gaps. Most of the region's biodiversity, endemic species, and species vulnerable to climate change are invertebrates, non-vascular plants, and fungi that are largely restricted to persistently cool and moist late-successional forests. Opportunities for climate change response for vulnerable taxa will necessarily be local due to a limited capacity of many species to move to new habitat, even over relatively small distances where land use practices create inhospitable conditions. The ecoregion's distinctive and endemic serpentine-substrate flora also is at risk and possible refugia are sites that will retain wet soil conditions, such as seeps and bogs.",2012,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,Article,climate change; ecoregion; Klamath-Siskiyou; microrefugia; refugia,web_of_science,Yes,,,,,,

Mountainous landscapes have been shown to be particularly sensitive to climate changes and are likely to experience significant impacts under predicted future climate regimes. Western white pine (Pinus monticola), a five-needle pine species that forms the most diverse of the white pine forest cover types in the western United States, is vulnerable to an interacting suite of threats that includes climate change, fire suppression, white pine blister rust (Cronartium ribicola), and mountain pine beetles (Dendroctonus ponderosae) that have already caused major changes in species distribution and abundance. We used the mechanistic simulation model FireBGCv2 to simulate effects of climate change and fire management on western white pines in a mountainous watershed in Glacier National Park, Montana, USA. Our results suggest that warming temperatures favor increased abundance of western white pine over existing climax and shade tolerant species in the study area, mainly because warmer conditions potentiate fire dynamics, including increased wildfire frequency and extent, which facilitates regeneration. Suppression of wildfires reduced the area dominated by western white pine, but fire suppression was less effective at limiting burned area extent and fire frequency in a warmer and drier climate. Wildfires created canopy gaps that allowed for western white pine regeneration at a high enough rate to escape local extirpation from white pine blister rust. Western white pine appears to be a resilient species even under fairly extreme warming trajectories and shifting fire regimes, and may provide a hedge against vegetation community shifts away from forest types and toward grass and shrublands.",2011,Forestry,Article,climate change; fire; mechanistic model; management; Strobus,web_of_science,Yes,,,,,,

We considered how the occurrence, size, and spatial location of large fires might respond to climate projections in the Greater Yellowstone ecosystem (GYE) (Wyoming), a large wildland ecosystem dominated by conifer forests and characterized by infrequent, high-severity fire. We developed a suite of statistical models that related monthly climate data (1972-1999) to the occurrence and size of fires >200 ha in the northern Rocky Mountains; these models were cross-validated and then used with downscaled (similar to 12 km x 12 km) climate projections from three global climate models to predict fire occurrence and area burned in the GYE through 2099. All models predicted substantial increases in fire by midcentury, with fire rotation (the time to burn an area equal to the landscape area) reduced to <30 y from the historical 100-300 y for most of the GYE. Years without large fires were common historically but are expected to become rare as annual area burned and the frequency of regionally synchronous fires increase. Our findings suggest a shift to novel fire-climate-vegetation relationships in Greater Yellowstone by midcentury because fire frequency and extent would be inconsistent with persistence of the current suite of conifer species.

We compared correlations in salmonid density in central Idaho and examined the relationships between changes in salmonid density and the variation in large-scale bioclimatic conditions as indexed by stream flow, air temperature, drought, coastal upwelling, and the number of Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha redds (a surrogate for nutrient influx and therefore increased stream productivity). The average densities of six stream-dwelling salmonid fishes were highly synchronous, with declines from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s followed by a rebound through 2003. All pairwise correlations were positive and 8 of 15 were statistically significant. Stream flow and Chinook salmon redds were correlated with fish densities as a group, but the importance of bioclimatic indices differed by species and varied by the lag times applied. Stream flow 3 and 4 years previous was most important for brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis and bull trout S. confluentus. The presence of Chinook salmon redds from the previous year was most important for Chinook salmon. The coastal upwelling index 4 years previous was most important for mountain whitefish Prosopium williamsoni and steelhead O. mykiss. No variable captured much of the variation in the density of westslope cutthroat trout O. clarkii lewisi. Models based on data from 1985 to 2003 correctly predicted the synchronous declines in fish density observed for all species from 2004 to 2009, suggesting that the bioclimatic indices we chose were useful surrogates for large-scale factors influencing the temporal changes in salmonid densities in central Idaho. For fishery managers, interspecies synchrony may allow a more powerful multispecies approach to monitoring and reveal the tractability of large systems to management control.

The extent that the current distribution of this species may be altered under a changing climate is an important question for managers of wood supply as well as those interested in conservation of subalpine ecosystems. In this paper, we address the question, how much might the current range of the species shift under a changing climate? We first assessed the extent that suboptimal temperature, frost, drought, and humidity deficits affect photosynthesis and growth of the species across the Pacific Northwest with a process-based model (3-PG). We then entered the same set of climatic variables into a decision-tree model, which creates a suite of rules that differentially rank the variables, to provide a basis for predicting presence or absence of the species under current climatic conditions. The derived decision-tree model successfully predicted weighted presence and absence recorded on 12,660 field survey plots with an accuracy of similar to 70%. The analysis indicated that sites with significant spring frost, summer temperatures averaging < 15A degrees C and soils that fully recharged from snowmelt were most likely to support lodgepole pine. Based on these criteria, we projected climatic conditions through the twenty-first century as they might develop without additional efforts to reduce carbon emissions using the Canadian Climate Centre model (CGCM2). In the 30-year period centered around 2020, the area suitable for lodgepole pine in the Pacific Northwest was projected to be reduced only slightly (8%). Thereafter, however, the projected climatic conditions appear to progressively favor other species, so that by the last 30 years of twenty-first century, lodgepole pine could be nearly absent from much of its current range. We conclude that process-based models, because they are highly sensitive to seasonal variation in solar radiation, are well adapted to identify the importance of different climatic variables on photosynthesis and growth. These same variables, once indentified, and run through a decision-tree model, provide a reasonable approach to predict current and future patterns in a species' distribution.",2011,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Article,NA,web_of_science,Yes,,,,,,

However, few studies have quantified impacts on carbon (C) cycling. In this study, we quantified the immediate response and subsequent trajectories of stand-level aboveground tree C stocks and fluxes using field measurements and modeling for a location in central Idaho, USA that experienced an outbreak of mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins). We measured tree characteristics in lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) plots spanning a range of structure and mortality conditions. We then initialized the forest vegetation simulator, an individual tree-based model, with these measurements and simulated the response of aboveground production of C fluxes as well as trajectories of C stocks and fluxes in the coming decades. Mountain pine beetles killed up to 52% of the trees within plots, with more larger trees killed. C stocks in lodgepole pine were reduced by 31-83% following the outbreak, and plot-level C fluxes decreased 28-73%. Modeled C stocks increased nearly continuously following the infestation, recovering to preoutbreak levels in 25 years or less. Simulated aboveground tree C fluxes increased following the immediate postoutbreak decrease, then subsequently declined. Substantial variability of C stocks and fluxes among plots resulted from the number and size of killed and surviving trees. Our study illustrates that bark beetle epidemics alter forest C cycling unlike stand-replacement wildfires or clear-cut harvests, due in part to incomplete mortality coupled with the preference by beetles for larger trees. The dependency of postoutbreak C stocks and fluxes on stand structure suggests that C budget models and studies in areas experiencing mountain pine beetle disturbances need to include size distribution of trees for the most accurate results.",2011,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Article,bark beetle; carbon storage; Dendroctonus ponderosae; forest disturbance; forest growth simulation; forest vegetation simulator; insect outbreak; Pinus contorta,web_of_science,Yes,,,,,,

Well and stream hydrographs are analysed using a series of diagnostic tools including time series plots, hysteresis plots, and cross-correlation plots. Characterizing the seasonal timing of the response requires consideration of the hydroclimatology of the region: rainfall-dominated (pluvial), snowmelt-dominated (nival) or hybrid (mixture of rain and snow). The magnitude and timing of the recharge and discharge response of the groundwater system was shown to depend on the storage and permeability characteristics of the aquifer and whether the system is stream-driven or recharge-driven. These two dominant stream-aquifer system types were defined based on classifying different aquifer types found in the southwest portion of the province. The classification scheme and diagnostic tools have the potential to provide a framework for evaluating the responses of wells in other mountainous regions. Using this framework, the potential consequences of future climate change may then be better understood based on the interactions between the hydrogeological and hydroclimatic settings of these aquifers.

Local climate regimes associated with frequent cold air pooling have substantial impacts on species phenology, distribution and diversity. However, little is known about how the degree and frequency of cold air drainage and pooling will respond to a changing climate. Evidence suggests that, because cold pools are decoupled from the free atmosphere, these local climates may not respond in the same way as regional-scale climates estimated from coarse-grid general circulation models. Indeed, recent studies have demonstrated that historical changes M the frequency of synoptic conditions have produced complex spatial variations in the resulting climatic changes on the ground. In the mountainous terrain of the Oregon Cascades, we show that, at relatively exposed hill slope and ridge top locations, air temperatures are highly coupled to changes in synoptic circulation patterns at the 700-hPa level, whereas in sheltered valley bottoms, cold air pooling at night and during winter causes temperatures to be largely decoupled from, and relatively insensitive to, 700-hPa How variations. The result is a complex temperature landscape composed of steep gradients in temporal variation. controlled largely by gradients in elevation and topographic position. When a projected climate warming of 2.5 degrees C was combined with likely changes in the frequency distribution of synoptic circulation, modelled temperature changes at closely spaced locations diverged widely (by up to 6 degrees C), with differences equalling or exceeding that of the imposed regional temperature change. Because cold air pooling and consequent atmospheric decoupling occur in many mountain valleys, especially at high latitudes. this phenomenon is likely to he an important consideration in understanding the impacts of climate change in mountainous regions.

Cascade spring snowpack declined 23% during 1930-2007. This loss is nearly statistically significant at the 5% level. The snowpack increased 19% during the recent period of most rapid global warming (1976-2007), though this change is not statistically significant because of large annual variability. From 1950 to 1997, a large and statistically significant decline of 48% occurred. However, 80% of this decline is connected to changes in the circulation patterns over the North Pacific Ocean that vary naturally on annual to interdecadal time scales. The residual time series of Cascade snowpack after Pacific variability is removed displays a relatively steady loss rate of 2.0% decade (1), yielding a loss of 16% from 1930 to 2007. This loss is very nearly statistically significant and includes the possible impacts of anthropogenic global warming. The dates of maximum snowpack and 90% melt out have shifted 5 days earlier since 1930. Both shifts are statistically insignificant.

Both climate change and climate variability have characteristic spatial patterns and time scales. The focus of this study is the regional-scale response of glaciers to natural patterns of climate variability. Using the Pacific Northwest of North America as the setting, the authors employ a simple linear glacier model to study how the combination of patterns of melt-season temperature and patterns of annual accumulation produce patterns of glacier length variations. Regional-scale spatial correlations in glacier length variations reflect three factors: the spatial correlations in precipitation and melt-season temperature, the geometry of a glacier and how it determines the relative importance of temperature and precipitation, and the climatic setting of the glaciers (i.e., maritime or continental). With the self-consistent framework developed here, the authors are able to evaluate the relative importance of these three factors. The results also highlight that, in order to understand the natural variability of glaciers, it is critically important to know the small-scale patterns of climate in mountainous terrain.

This paper mechanistically assesses the flushing mechanism of DOC, DON and DIN at the hillslope and catchment scale during two storm events, in a small catchment (WS10), H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest in the western Cascade Mountains of Oregon. Using a combination of natural tracer and hydrometric data, and end-member mixing analysis we were able to describe the exact flushing mechanism at the site. This mechanism involved vertical preferential flow to the soil-bedrock interface and then lateral downslope flow, with a finite source of DOC and DON in the organic horizon. Both specific UV absorbance (SUVA, 254 nm) and continuously measured raw fluorescence measured with a fluorometer increased during the storm events, suggesting DOC was more aromatic during stormflow compared to baseflow conditions. SUVA patterns in lateral subsurface flow from the hillslope and stream water in combination with hydrometric data enabled us to infer that the contribution of deep soil water and groundwater was higher during the falling limb compared to the rising limb of the hydrograph and contributed to the dilution of DOC, DON and SUVA values during storm events. Overall this study showed the value of using a combination of hydrometric data, natural tracer data, and in particular DOC quality indices such as SUVA and fluorescence to mechanistically assess nutrient flushing at the catchment scale.

Many studies have drawn the link between local meteorological conditions and glacier mass balance, but these statistical relationships are difficult to extrapolate to other sites or to apply in sensitivity studies of future climate change. In this paper, we explore the ability to predict regional climate anomalies and glacier mass balance in the Canadian Rockies on the basis of 500-mb circulation indices derived from the NCEP-NCAR reanalysis dataset. Daily precipitation amounts and variance-weighted seasonal temperature and precipitation anomalies at a suite of six long-term meteorological stations in the Canadian Rockies (1953-2002) demonstrate a coherent dependence on the daily and mean seasonal atmospheric flow indices. The Peyto Glacier, Alberta, Canada offers the best available mass balance time-series in the Canadian Rockies (1966-2004). Regression models for Peyto Glacier winter, summer, and annual mass balance variability were constructed from (1) Jasper climate anomalies, (2) regional climate anomalies, and (3) atmospheric flow indices. Model performance was examined in terms of the multiple coefficient of determination and of the variables retained in the stepwise regression analysis. Flow indices were the stronger predictors of mass balance. This offers important advantages for mass balance forecasts, because large-scale circulation patterns are better captured than surface weather in mountain regions, in both reanalysed climatology and model-generated climate change scenarios.

Mean monthly temperature anomalies from 1982 to 1999 are examined for 60 SNOTEL and 296 GHCN/CRU sites at elevations over 500 m with relatively homogenous records. The surface/free-air temperature difference Delta T (T-s - T-a) is calculated for both the SNOTEL and GHCN/CRU datasets. Topography influences the correlation between surface and free-air temperature anomalies. Physically realistic diurnal and seasonal changes in Delta T are illustrated. Systematic secular trends in surface temperatures, free-air temperatures, and Delta T are revealed, but the sign and magnitude of change depends on location, meaning that regional signals are weak. The T-s trends are positive for most GHCN and CRU sites, and for SNOTEL sites at night. Daytime cooling in the SNOTEL network reduces the mean daily warming trend. The T-s trends are consistently positive for both networks and are often larger than T-s Thus mean Delta T trends are negative for both datasets. The smaller sample size in the SNOTEL dataset means that error estimates for regional signals are much wider than for the GHCN/CRU dataset. Trend difference maps identify potentially anomalous SNOTEL records. Trends show no correlation with elevation and topography. Surface trends show higher variability and account for most of the uncertainty in Delta T trends. Sensitivity of trends to time period is also discussed.

Residual statistics from the tree-ring reconstruction, as well as an identically specified instrumental reconstruction, exhibit positive trends over time.

Those sensitivities were quantified using the kappa statistic. Simulated vegetation in the western United States was sensitive to changes in atmospheric CO2 concentrations, with woody biome types replacing less woody types throughout the domain. The simulated vegetation was also sensitive to climatic effects, particularly at high elevations, due to both warming throughout the domain and decreased precipitation in key mountain regions such as the Sierra Nevada of California and the Cascade and Blue Mountains of Oregon. Significantly, when the direct effects of CO2 on vegetation were tested in combination with the indirect effects of CO2-induced climate change, new vegetation patterns were created that were not seen in either of the individual cases.

Long-tenri reconstructions of Holocene fire regimes, provided by the analysis of charcoal, pollen, and other fire proxies in a network of lake records, indicate that the Pacific Northwest and summer-dry regions of the northern Rocky Mountains experienced their highest fire activity in the early Holocene (11,000-7000 years ago) and during the Medieval Warm Period (ca. 1000 years ago) when drought conditions were more severe than today. In contrast, in summer-wet areas of the northern Rocky Mountains, the period of highest fire activity was registered in the last 7000 years when dry woodland vegetation developed. When synthesized across the entire northwestern US, the paleoecological record reveals that past and present fire regimes are strongly controlled by climate changes occurring on multiple time scales. The scarcity of fires in the 20th century in some northwestern US ecosystems may be the result of successful fire suppression policies, but in wetter forests this absence is consistent with long-term fire regime patterns. In addition, simulations of potential future climate and vegetation indicate that future fire conditions in some parts of the northwestern US could be more severe than they are today.

Thus, the ecosystem processes controlling these pools are central to understanding the transfers of carbon (C) between the atmosphere and terrestrial systems. To examine these ecosystem processes, the effect of stand age on temporal carbon source-sink relationships was examined in 20-year-old, 40-year-old and old-growth stands of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) in the Cascade Mountains of south-central Washington State. Belowground C and nitrogen (N) storage and soil respiration were measured. In addition, nylon mesh bags containing homogenized soils from each site were buried at the respective sites to quantify root ingrowth and potential C sequestration and loss. The sites supporting the 20- and 40-year-old stands had soil C stores reflecting the C contributions from logging residue, coarse woody debris and stumps left after harvest. Because the N-fixer red alder (Alnus rubra Bong.) comprised 33% of the 40-year-old stand, this site had significantly greater concentrations and pools of N in the forest floor than sites without red alder. This N-rich site had consistently lower soil CO(2) efflux rates during the growing season than the sites supporting the 20-year-old and old-growth stands. Estimated annual soil C efflux was 1367, 883 and 1194 g m(-2) for the sites supporting the 20-, 40- and old-growth stands, respectively. These values are higher than previously reported values. Root ingrowth was significantly less in the 40-year-old stand than in the 20-year-old stand, and both young stands showed markedly less fine root growth than the old-growth stand. At the sites supporting the young stands, C and N were lost from the soil bags, whereas there was an increase in C and N in the soil bags at the site supporting the old-growth stand. The fine root growth and soil respiration data support the hypothesis that belowground C allocation decreases with increasing fertility.

The winter snow accumulation is particularly reduced in the Kings River basin which has the greatest elevation range. In absolute terms, the smallest snowpack reduction occurred in the semi-arid basin of Rio Grande at Del Norte. The decline of snow covered area in the snowmelt season in accelerated by about one month in all basins. The runoff in the winter half year is about doubled at the expense of the summer half year in the basins Illecillewaet and Kings River. This effect is smaller in the basin Rio Grande at Del Norte.

To bridge the gap between what is required and what is resolved, we propose a subgrid-scale parameterization of the influence of topography on clouds, precipitation, and land surface hydrology. The parameterization represents subgrid variations in surface elevation in terms of probability distributions of discrete elevation classes. Separate cloud, radiative, and surface processes are calculated for each elevation class. Rainshadow effects are not treated by the parameterization; they have to be explicitly resolved by the host model. The simulated surface temperature, precipitation, and snow cover for each elevation class are distributed to different geographical locations according to the spatial distribution of surface elevation within each grid cell. The subgrid parameterization has been implemented in the Pacific Northwest Laboratory's climate version of the Penn State/NCAR Mesoscale Model. The scheme is evaluated by driving the regional climate model with observed lateral boundary conditions for the Pacific Northwest and comparing simulated fields with surface observations.

However, there have been few empirical examples of longitudinal patterns of temperature in large rivers due to a paucity of data. We constructed longitudinal thermal profiles (temperature vs distance) for 53 rivers in the Pacific Northwest (USA) using an extensive data set of remotely sensed summertime river temperatures and classified each profile into one of five patterns of downstream warming: asymptotic (increasing then flattening), linear (increasing steadily), uniform (not changing), parabolic (increasing then decreasing), or complex (not fitting other classes). We evaluated (1) how frequently profiles warmed asymptotically downstream as expected, and (2) whether relationships between river temperature and common hydroclimatic variables differed by profile class. We found considerable diversity in profile shape, with 47% of rivers warming asymptotically and 53% having alternative profile shapes. Water temperature did not warm substantially over the course of the river for coastal parabolic and uniform profiles, and for some linear and complex profiles. Profile classes showed no clear geographical trends. The degree of correlation between river temperature and hydroclimatic variables differed among profile classes, but there was overlap among classes. Water temperature in rivers with asymptotic or parabolic profiles was positively correlated with August air temperature, tributary temperature and velocity, and negatively correlated with elevation, August precipitation, gradient and distance upstream. Conversely, associations were less apparent in rivers with linear, uniform or complex profiles. Factors contributing to the unique shape of parabolic profiles differed for coastal and inland rivers, where downstream cooling was influenced locally by climate or cool water inputs, respectively. Potential drivers of shape for complex profiles were specific to each river. These thermal patterns indicate diverse thermal habitats that may promote resilience of aquatic biota to climate change. Without this spatial context, climate change models may incorrectly estimate loss of thermally suitable habitat.

Identifying the environmental filters that exert selective pressures on specific riparian vegetation guilds is a critical step in setting baseline expectations for how riparian vegetation may respond to environmental conditions anticipated under future global change scenarios. In this study, we ask: (1) What riparian plant guilds exist across the interior Columbia and upper Missouri River basins? (2) What environmental filters shape riparian guild distributions? (3) How does resource partitioning among guilds influence guild distributions and co-occurrence? Woody species composition was measured at 703 stream reaches and each species' morphological and functional attributes were extracted from a database in four categories: (1) life form, (2) persistence and growth, (3) reproduction, and (4) resource use. We clustered species into guilds by morphological characteristics and attributes related to environmental tolerances, modeling these guilds' distributions as a function of environmental filters-regional climate, watershed hydrogeomorphic characteristics, and stream channel form-and guild coexistence. We identified five guilds: (1) a tall, deeply rooted, long-lived, evergreen tree guild, (2) a xeric, disturbance tolerant shrub guild, (3) a hydrophytic, thicket-forming shrub guild, (4) a low-statured, shade-tolerant, understory shrub guild, and (5) a flood tolerant, mesoriparian shrub guild. Guilds were most strongly discriminated by species' rooting depth, canopy height and potential to resprout and grow following biomass-removing disturbance (e.g., flooding, fire). Hydro-climatic variables, including precipitation, watershed area, water table depth, and channel form attributes reflective of hydrologic regime, were predictors of guilds whose life history strategies had affinity or aversion to flooding, drought, and fluvial disturbance. Biotic interactions excluded guilds with divergent life history strategies and/or allowed for the co-occurrence of guilds that partition resources differently in the same environment.

The assessment employed observations of sensitivity and response to climatic variability, downscaled climate projections, literature reviews, current management policies and practices, expert knowledge, and stakeholder engagement. Primary pathways for climate impacts focused on projected increases in extreme high flows and flooding, elevated winter soil moisture and landslide hazards, and loss of snowpack. The biggest impacts to roads and trails are expected from temperature-induced changes in hydrologic regimes that enhance autumn flooding and reduce spring snowpack. Projected higher winter soil moisture caused by changes in seasonal precipitation and snow accumulation could reduce slope stability. Earlier snowmelt may lengthen the snow-free season for visitor use and agency operations. Infrastructure age, design, maintenance, location, use, and limited redundancy along with funding policies and management, influence the sensitivities of the transportation system. Vulnerabilities were identified based on when and where these sensitivities to changes in climate may emerge. Adaptation strategies and tactics identified to address these vulnerabilities included: upgrading stream crossing and drainage design, changing use and maintenance, relocating or closing roads and trails, modifying funding policies, and expanding pubic engagement.

Presently, the assessment of potential elevation-dependent responses is difficult because many gauged watersheds integrate drainage areas that are both snow and rain dominated. To predict the impact of snowline rise on streamflow, we mapped the current snowline (1980m) for the Salmon River watershed (Idaho, USA) and projected its elevation after 3 degrees C warming (2440m). This increase results in a 40% reduction in snow-covered area during winter months. We expand this analysis by collecting streamflow records from a new, elevation-stratified gauging network of watersheds contained within high (2250-3800m), mid (1500-2250m) and low (300-1500m) elevations that isolate snow, mixed and rain-dominated precipitation regimes. Results indicate that lags between percentiles of precipitation and streamflow are much shorter in low elevations than in mid- and high-elevation watersheds. Low elevation annual percentiles (Q(25) and Q(75)) of streamflow occur 30-50days earlier than in higher elevation watersheds. Extreme events in low elevations are dominated by low- and no-flow events whereas mid- and high-elevation extreme events are primarily large magnitude floods. Only mid- and high-elevation watersheds are strongly cross correlated with catchment-wide flow of the Salmon River, suggesting that changes in contributions from low-elevation catchments may be poorly represented using mainstem gauges. As snowline rises, mid-elevation watersheds will likely exhibit behaviours currently observed only at lower elevations. Streamflow monitoring networks designed for operational decision making or change detection may require modification to capture elevation-dependent responses of streamflow to warming.

Interactions between nonnative species may alter their impacts on native species, yet few studies have addressed multispecies interactions. The spread of whirling disease, caused by the nonnative parasite Myxobolus cerebralis, has generated declines in wild trout populations across western North America. Westslope Cutthroat Trout Oncorhynchus clarkii lewisi in the northern Rocky Mountains are threatened by hybridization with introduced Rainbow Trout O. mykiss. Rainbow Trout are more susceptible to whirling disease than Cutthroat Trout and may be more vulnerable due to differences in spawning location. We hypothesized that the presence of whirling disease in a stream would (1) reduce levels of introgressive hybridization at the site scale and (2) limit the size of the hybrid zone at the whole-stream scale. We measured levels of introgression and the spatial extent of hybridization between Rainbow Trout and Westslope Cutthroat Trout in four disease-positive streams and six disease-negative streams within the Blackfoot River basin of Montana. In addition to disease status, we considered habitat quality, stream slope, distance from the confluence, temperature, and elevation. Whirling disease presence was not associated with either the level of introgression at a site or the size of the hybrid zone. Temperature, elevation, and stream slope were all influential in determining levels of introgression at the site scale. Stream slope was the most influential factor determining the size of the hybrid zone, as longer, steeper streams contained smaller hybrid zones. Stream slope is a driver of many habitat characteristics that may provide refuge from invasive species in the coming decades. Although the multispecies interactions examined in this study did not alter the impacts of invasion on native species, community assemblages will continue to change with the spread of nonnative species, requiring continued assessment to determine their impacts on native species.",2015,Fisheries,Article,NA,web_of_science,Yes,,,,,,

This is particularly important for improving the simulation accuracy of models used to evaluate potential hydrologic responses to land use and climate change. The distributed hydrology soil-vegetation model (DHSVM) was parameterized for the Mica Creek Experimental Watershed in northern Idaho. Performance was assessed based on measured streamflow from nested and paired watersheds, snowpack dynamics, soil moisture, and transpiration estimated from sap flux. In general, DHSVM effectively simulated snowpack dynamics, soil water content, and the streamflow regime. Streamflow simulation for seven subcatchments had model efficiencies ranging between 0.63 and 0.79. Model efficiency of snowpack simulation at a SNOTEL site was 0.95. Some minor discrepancies between simulated and measured values suggested that some processes, such as snow redistribution, were not represented by the model or were insufficiently parameterized for local conditions. A sensitivity analysis indicated that soil porosity, leaf area index, and minimum stomatal resistance were among the most influential parameters that affected variations in the simulated hydrological regime. However, those variables can be reasonably estimated based on field or remote sensing data. Other important parameters, such as saturated hydraulic conductivity, are more difficult to quantify and therefore need to be refined during the calibration phase. A description of the iterative parameter refinement process that was used in the calibration phase of the model is included to assist other researchers in refining model parameterizations.

Although mechanistic models are commonly applied for evaluation of climate effects for snowmelt, empirical relationships provide a first-order validation of the various postulates required for their implementation. Previous studies of empirical sensitivity for April 1 snow water equivalent (SWE) in the western United States were developed by regressing interannual variations in SWE to winter precipitation and temperature. This offers a temporal analog for climate change, positing that a warmer future looks like warmer years. Spatial analogs are used to hypothesize that a warmer future may look like warmer places, and are frequently applied alternatives for complex processes, or states/metrics that show little interannual variability (e.g., forest cover). We contrast spatial and temporal analogs for sensitivity of April 1 SWE and the mean residence time of snow (SRT) using data from 524 Snowpack Telemetry (SNOTEL) stations across the western U.S. We built relatively strong models using spatial analogs to relate temperature and precipitation climatology to snowpack climatology (April 1 SWE, R-2=0.87, and SRT, R-2=0.81). Although the poorest temporal analog relationships were in areas showing the highest sensitivity to warming, spatial analog models showed consistent performance throughout the range of temperature and precipitation. Generally, slopes from the spatial relationships showed greater thermal sensitivity than the temporal analogs, and high elevation stations showed greater vulnerability using a spatial analog than shown in previous modeling and sensitivity studies. The spatial analog models provide a simple perspective to evaluate potential futures and may be useful in further evaluation of snowpack with warming.",2014,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Water Resources,Article,NA,web_of_science,Yes,,,,,,

Determining how the MPB has expanded its range to breach putative barriers, whether physical (nonforested prairie and high elevation of the Rocky Mountains) or climatic (extreme continental climate where temperatures can be below -40 A degrees C), may contribute to our general understanding of range changes as well as management of the current epidemic. Here, we use a panel of 1,536 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to assess population genetic structure, connectivity, and signals of selection within this MPB range expansion. Biallelic SNPs in MPB from southwestern Canada revealed higher genetic differentiation and lower genetic connectivity than in the northern part of its range. A total of 208 unique SNPs were identified using different outlier detection tests, of which 32 returned annotations for products with putative functions in cholesterol synthesis, actin filament contraction, and membrane transport. We suggest that MPB has been able to spread beyond its previous range by adjusting its cellular and metabolic functions, with genome scale differentiation enabling populations to better withstand cooler climates and facilitate longer dispersal distances.

Assuming that distributional differences between life stages highlight shifting regeneration patterns relative to adult trees, we assessed differences between seedlings and adult trees based on predicted probabilities of occurrence and climate envelope boundaries. ResultsDifferences between occurrence probabilities for seedlings and adults were greatest for montane, as opposed to subalpine, species and along range margins, especially in the southern and western portions of the study area. Climate envelope boundaries of seedlings differed from adult trees most frequently in montane species and often suggested range contractions or range shifts, as opposed to range expansion.

National parks in Canada's Rocky and Purcell Mountains offer a rare opportunity to evaluate the impacts of a century of conservation on forest carbon (C) stocks and fluxes. We studied forest ecosystem C dynamics of three national parks in the Rocky and Purcell Mountains of British Columbia - Yoho, Kootenay, and Glacier National Parks - over the period 1970-2008 using the CBM-CFS3 inventory-based forest C budget model. We hypothesized that parks and protected areas would contain higher forest C density and have lower CO2 uptake rates compared to their surrounding reference areas because of the exclusion of timber harvesting and resulting predominance of older, slower growing forest stands. Results for Glacier National Park relative to its reference area were consistent with our hypothesis. Forests in Kootenay National Park were substantially younger than those in its reference area despite the exclusion of harvesting because natural disturbances affected large areas within the park over the past century. Site productivity in Kootenay National Park was also generally higher in the park than in its reference area. Consequently, Kootenay National Park had both higher C density and higher CO2 uptake than its reference area. Yoho National Park forests were similar in age to reference area forests and more productive, and therefore had both higher C stocks and greater CO2 uptake. C density was higher in all 3 parks compared to their surrounding areas, and parks with younger forests than reference areas had higher CO2 uptake. The results of this study indicate that forest conservation in protected areas such as national parks can preserve existing C stocks where natural disturbances are rare. Where natural disturbances are an important part of the forest ecology, conservation may or may not contribute to climate change mitigation because of the risk of C loss in the event of wildfire or insect-caused tree mortality. Anticipated increases in natural disturbance resulting from global warming may further reduce the climate change mitigation potential of forest conservation in disturbance-prone ecosystems. We show that managing for the ecological integrity of landscapes can also have carbon mitigation co-benefits. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Radiocarbon dating of alluvial charcoal reconstructed local fire occurrence and geomorphic response, and fossil woodrat (Neotoma) middens revealed pinyon and juniper arrivals. Fire peaks occurred similar to 10,700-9500, 7200-6700, 2400-2000, 850-700, and 550-400 cal yr BP, whereas similar to 9500-7200, 6700-4700 and similar to 1500-1000 cal yr BP are fire-free. Wetter climates and denser vegetation fueled episodic fires and debris flows during the early and late Holocene, whereas drier climates and reduced vegetation caused frequent sheetflooding during the mid-Holocene. Increased fires during the wetter and more variable late Holocene suggest variable climate and adequate fuels augment fires at CIRO. Utah juniper and single-leaf pinyon colonized CIRO by 3800 and 2800 cal yr BP, respectively, though pinyon did not expand broadly until similar to 700 cal yr BP. Increased fire-related deposition coincided with regional droughts and pinyon infilling similar to 850-700 and 550-400 cal yr BP. Early and late Holocene vegetation change probably played a major role in accelerated fire activity, which may be sustained into the future due to pinyon-juniper densification and cheatgrass invasion.

Better knowledge of this zone is relevant, given the recent host expansion of mountain pine beetle into jack pine. We characterized the zone by genotyping 1998 lodgepole, jack pine, and hybrids from British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Ontario, and Minnesota at 11 microsatellites. Using Bayesian algorithms, we calculated genetic ancestry and used this to model the relationship between species occurrence and environment. In addition, we analyzed the ancestry of hybrids to calculate the genetic contribution of lodgepole and jack pine. Finally, we measured the amount of gene flow between the pure species. We found the distribution of the pine classes is explained by environmental variables, and these distributions differ from classic distribution maps. Hybrid ancestry was biased toward lodgepole pine; however, gene flow between the two species was equal.

However, even in subbasins with low storage capacity, we found significant change in most timing of flow metrics. We also found that damming, especially in subbasins with higher storage capacity, overwhelmed climate variability in all basins for most flow metrics.

Here we examined biotic and abiotic factors determining contaminant variability of wildlife in alpine ecosystems. We measured POPs in eggs and plasma of an apex predator, the osprey (Pandion haliaetus) breeding in IS mountainous watersheds across a broad latitudinal, longitudinal and altitudinal range in western Canada. After accounting for proximate biotic factors such as trophic level (delta N-15) and carbon source (delta C-13), variability in contaminant concentrations, including Sigma DDT (sum of trichlorodiphenylethane-related compounds), toxaphene, hexachlorobenzene (HCB), total chlordane, and Sigma PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) in osprey tissues was explained by interactions among relative size of watersheds, water bodies, elevation, and glacial input. Sigma DDT in nestling plasma, for example, decreased with lake elevation, probably as a result of local past inputs from agricultural or public health usage at lower altitude sites. In contrast, toxaphene, never used as an insecticide in western Canada, increased with elevation and year-round snow and ice cover in both plasma and eggs, indicating long-range atmospheric sources as dominant for toxaphene. Lower chlorinated PCBs in plasma tended to decrease with elevation and ice cover consistent with published data and model outcomes. Temporal trends of POPs in osprey eggs are coincident with some modeled predictions of release from melting glaciers due to climate change.

The goal of our research is to employ a robust clustering algorithm to provide a transparent method of integrating remotely sensed datasets into homogeneous ecosystem units for conservation planning and monitoring ecosystem condition and change. Using a suite of ecosystem characteristics derived from digital elevation and remotely sensed data at 1 km spatial resolution, we classify the 94 million ha within the province of British Columbia (BC), Canada, into 16 terrestrial ecosystem regions (and a water category) using a two-step clustering approach. Initially, 10 metrics representing the physical environment (elevation and soil wetness potential), available energy (solar insolation and snow melt) and vegetation production (fraction of photosynthetically active radiation) were considered for ecosystem classification, which were reduced to six after analyzing variable inter-correlations. The results provide ecologically unique terrestrial regions: ten of which describe the Northern Boreal, Coastal Mountains and Southern Interior Mountains, and six the coastal lowlands, Georgia Depression, interior, Boreal Plains and Taiga Plains. Analyzing the spatial interaction between the cluster categories revealed that highly dispersed ecosystem types occur most often in the intermediate elevation zone, moderate dispersion at the highest elevations, and homogeneity in the lowland areas where elevation remains relatively constant. When overlaid with BC's standard biogeoclimatic ecosystem classification zones the newly developed regions represent similar ecosystem ranges in the coastal, Taiga and Boreal Plains.

Large regions in western North America have become more favorable to the MPB, which has extended its range into higher elevations and more northerly latitudes, previously considered climatically unsuitable. Various investigators, and recent forest health surveys in Alberta have suggested that the beetle's range could shift further east on both lodgepole (Pinus contorta Dougl.) and jack pine (Pious banksiana Lamb.) into the boreal forest. A risk assessment of the threat of MPB to Canada's boreal forest identified effective monitoring and detection in areas vulnerable to infestation as the most critical information need. Changing climate may also be independently impacting pine forests, for instance through moisture stress. Species' vulnerability to climate change is reflected in modeled increases or decreases in the probability of its presence across its range. We hypothesize that areas within the current ranges of lodgepole and jack pine that have historically been sub-optimal for beetle expansion may become increasingly vulnerable as a result of climate change. In our analysis, we first test the ability of physiologically-based models to predict the recorded distributions of lodgepole and jack pine for 12,456 ground plots across British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan, using monthly climatic data derived for a calibration period between 1950 and 1975. Both the presence and absence of the two tree species recorded on survey plots were predicted, on average, with an accuracy of 85% for the calibration period. We then identified locations that appear to have become less suitable for these pine species in each subsequent year between 1976 and 2006 and found that the suitable range area for lodgepole and jack pine for > 50% of years in the period decreased by 45% and 40%, respectively. These results were compared with outputs from a climate-suitability model that identified areas of potential range expansion by MPB for two periods: 2001-2030 and 2010-2040. The area of vulnerable lodgepole pine forests that coincided with the area of potential beetle expansion was 40,000 km(2) in 2001-2030 and 45,000 km(2) in 2010-2040. The area of vulnerable jack pine was much less, ranging from 4000 to 8000 km(2) for the two periods. This analysis is unique in that it acknowledges the complexity of the beetle-host interaction by incorporating the potential impact of climate change on each of these elements into predictions of future host susceptibility to infestation. Such information is vital for assessing the ongoing risk of MPB range expansion and for designing future monitoring programs. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

A large number of migratory bird species appear to be declining as the result of climate change, but whether resident bird species have or will be adversely affected by climate change is less clear. We focus on the South Hills crossbill (Loxia curvirostra complex), which is endemic to about 70 km(2) of Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta latifolia) forest in southern Idaho, USA. 2. Our results indicate that the South Hills crossbill has declined by over 60% between 2003 and 2008, and that decreasing adult survival drives this population decline. 3. We evaluated the relative support for multiple hypotheses linking crossbill survival to climate, an ectoparasitic mite (scaly-leg mites Knemidokoptes jamaicensis), and the recent emergence of West Nile virus. Changes in adult apparent survival rate were closely associated with average spring and annual temperatures, and with high temperatures (>= 32 degrees C) during summer, which have increased during the last decade. In contrast, there was little evidence that scaly-leg mites or West Nile virus contributed to recent declines in adult survival. 4. The most probable mechanism causing the decline in adult survival and population size is a decrease in the availability of their primary food resource, seeds in serotinous pine cones. Cone production has declined with increasing annual temperatures, and these cones appear to be prematurely opening owing to increasingly hot summer conditions releasing their seeds and reducing the carrying capacity for crossbills later in the year. 5. In light of regional climate change forecasts, which include an increase in both annual temperature and hot days (>32 degrees C), and the likely disappearance of lodgepole pine from southern Idaho by the end of this century, additional research is needed to determine how to maintain lodgepole pine forests and their supply of seeds to conserve one of the few bird species endemic to the continental United States.",2012,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Zoology,Article,apparent annual survival; climate change; crossbills; Great Basin; Loxia; Pinus contorta; population decline; trophic interactions,web_of_science,Yes,,,,,,

The mountain pine beetle Dendroctonus ponderosae (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), is a landscape-altering insect that infests forests of North America. Abundant availability of host trees due to altered disturbance regimes has facilitated an unprecedented, landscape-wide outbreak of this pest in British Columbia and Alberta, Canada, during the past decade. A previous outbreak in the 1980s, in central British Columbia, collapsed due to host depletion and extreme cold weather events. Despite the importance of such extreme weather events and other temperature-related signals in modulating an outbreak, few landscape-level models have studied the associations of extreme cold events with outbreak occurrences. We studied the individual associations of several biologically-relevant cold temperature variables, and other temperature/degree-day terms, with outbreak occurrences in a spatial-temporal logistic regression model using data from the current outbreak. Timing, frequency, and duration of cold snaps had a severe negative association with occurrence of an outbreak in a given area. Large drops in temperature (>10 degrees C) or extreme winter minimum temperatures reduced the outbreak probability. We then used the model to apply eight different climate change scenarios to the peak year of the current outbreak. Our scenarios involved combinations of increasing annual temperature and different variances about this trend. Our goal was to examine how spatial outbreak pattern would have changed in the face of changing thermal regime if the underlying outbreak behaviour remained consistent.

While climate change is widely expected to produce significant changes in hydrology and stream temperature, the effects of climate change on sediment yield have received less attention. In the northern Rocky Mountains, we expect climate change to increase sediment yield primarily through changes in temperature and hydrology that promote vegetation disturbances (i.e., wildfire, insect/pathogen outbreak, drought-related die off). Here, we synthesize existing data from central Idaho to explore (1) how sediment yields are likely to respond to climate change in semi-arid basins influenced by wildfire, (2) the potential consequences for aquatic habitat and water resource infrastructure, and (3) prospects for mitigating sediment yields in forest basins. Recent climate-driven increases in the severity and extent of wildfire suggest that basin-scale sediment yields within the next few years to decades could be greater than the long-term average rate of 146 T km(-2) year(-1) observed for central Idaho. These elevated sediment yields will likely impact downstream reservoirs, which were designed under conditions of historically lower sediment yield. Episodic erosional events (massive debris flows) that dominate post-fire sediment yields are impractical to mitigate, leaving road restoration as the most viable management opportunity for offsetting climate-related increases in sediment yield. However, short-term sediment yields from experimental basins with roads are three orders of magnitude smaller than those from individual fire-related events (on the order of 10(1) T km(-2) year(-1) compared to 10(4)T km(-2)year(-1), respectively, for similar contributing areas), suggesting that road restoration would provide a relatively minor reduction in sediment loads at the basin-scale. Nevertheless, the ecologically damaging effects of fine sediment (material <6 mm) chronically produced from roads will require continued management efforts.

Forests have already responded to these changes, and the future temperature and precipitation scenarios are of foremost concern, especially in the mountainous western United States, where forests occur in the dry environments that interface with grasslands. The objective of this study was to understand the trade-offs between temperature and water controls on these forested sites in the context of available climate projections. Three temperature and precipitation scenarios from IPCC AR4 AOGCMs ranging in precipitation levels were input to the process model Biome-BGC for key forested sites in the northern U. S. Rocky Mountains. Despite the omission of natural and human-caused disturbances in our simulations, our results show consequential effects from these conservative future temperature and precipitation scenarios. According to these projections, if future precipitation and temperatures are similar to or drier than the dry scenario depicted here, high-elevation forests on both the drier and wetter sites, which have in the absence of disturbance accumulated carbon, will reduce their carbon accumulation. Under the marginally drier climate projections, most forests became carbon sources by the end of the simulation horizon (2089). Under all three scenarios, growing season lengthened, the number of days with snow on the ground decreased, peak snow occurred earlier, and water stress increased through the projection horizon (1950-2089) for all sites, which represent the temperature and precipitation spectrum of forests in this region.

Hydrologic modeling directed at quantifying these potential changes has focused on the magnitude and timing of spring snowmelt as the key control on the spatial-temporal pattern of summer streamflow. We illustrate how spatial differences in groundwater dynamics can also play a significant role in determining streamflow responses to warming. We examine two contrasting watersheds, one located in the Western Cascades and the other in the High Cascades mountains of Oregon. We use both empirical analysis of streamflow data and physically based, spatially distributed modeling to disentangle the relative importance of multiple and interacting controls. In particular, we explore the extent to which differences in snow accumulation and melt and drainage characteristics (deep ground water vs. shallow subsurface) mediate the effect of climate change.

To understand the impacts of these stressors, it is crucial to develop assessments of forest properties to establish baselines, determine the extent of changes, and provide information to ecosystem modeling activities. Here we report on spatial patterns of characteristics of forest ecosystems in the western United States, including area, stand age, forest type, and carbon stocks, and comparisons of these patterns with those from satellite imagery and simulation models. The USDA Forest Service collected ground-based measurements of tree and plot information in recent decades as part of nationwide forest inventories. Using these measurements together with a methodology for estimating carbon stocks for each tree measured, we mapped county-level patterns across the western United States. Because forest ecosystem properties are often significantly different between hardwood and softwood species, we describe patterns of each. The stand age distribution peaked at 60 100 years across the region, with hardwoods typically younger than softwoods. Forest carbon density was highest along the coast region of northern California, Oregon, and Washington and lowest in the arid regions of the Southwest and along the edge of the Great Plains. These results quantify the spatial variability of forest characteristics important for understanding large-scale ecosystem processes and their controlling mechanisms. To illustrate other uses of the inventory-derived forest characteristics, we compared them against examples of independently derived estimates. Forest cover compared well with satellite-derived values when only productive stands were included in the inventory estimates. Forest types derived from satellite observations were similar to our inventory results, though the inventory database suggested more heterogeneity. Carbon stocks from the Century model were in good agreement with inventory results except in the Pacific Northwest and part of the Sierra Nevada, where it appears that harvesting and. re in the 20th century ( processes not included in the model runs) reduced measured stand ages and carbon stocks compared to simulations.",2007,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Article,century model; FIA; forest carbon stocks; forest cover; forest inventories; forest type; MODIS; western United States,web_of_science,Yes,,,,,,

The respective means for four populations of blue spruce were 42.7%, 1.6 alleles, and 0.138. Of total diversity, 14.7% was among populations in Engelmann spruce and 8.6% in blue spruce. In Engelmann spruce, numbers of alleles increased from south to north. Recent bottlenecks were indicated in the three southernmost populations of Engelmann spruce and in the northernmost population of blue spruce. Cluster analysis divided Engelmann spruce into a northern group and a Southwestern group; however, populations from Utah were distributed among both clusters. Genetic distance was correlated with geographic distance between northern populations but not between Southwestern populations, where drift predominated over gene flow. In two Engelmann spruce populations from Utah, multilocus outcrossing rates were 0.951 (+/- 0.016) and 0.940 (+/- 0.071).

The downscaling method makes minimal, physically based corrections to the global simulation while preserving much of the statistics of interannual variability in the climate model. Differences among the downscaled results for simulations of present-day climate form a basis for model evaluation. The downscaled results are used to simulate streamflow in the Yakima River, a mountainous basin in Washington, USA, to illustrate how model differences affect streamflow simulations. The downscaling is applied to the output of three models (ECHAM4, HADCM3, and NCAR-PCM) for simulations of historic conditions (1900-2000) and two future emissions scenarios (A2 and B2 for 2000-2100) from the IPCC assessment. The ECHAM4 simulation closely reproduces the observed statistics of temperature and precipitation for the 42 year period 1949-90. Streamflow computed from this climate simulation likewise produces similar statistics to streamflow computed from the observed data. Downscaled climate-change scenarios from these models are examined in light of the differences in the present-day simulations.

S., global climate simulations were produced using the National Center for Atmospheric Research/Department of Energy (NCAR/DOE) Parallel Climate Model (PCM). The Penn State/NCAR Mesoscale Model (MM5) was used to downscale the PCM control ( 20 years) and three future ( 2040 - 2060) climate simulations to yield ensemble regional climate simulations at 40 km spatial resolution for the western U. S. This paper describes the regional simulations and focuses on the hydroclimate conditions in the Columbia River Basin (CRB) and Sacramento- San Joaquin River (SSJ) Basin. Results based on global and regional simulations show that by mid-century, the average regional warming of 1 to 2.5 degreesC strongly affects snowpack in the western U. S. Along coastal mountains, reduction in annual snowpack was about 70% as indicated by the regional simulations. Besides changes in mean temperature, precipitation, and snowpack, cold season extreme daily precipitation increased by 5 to 15 mm/day (15 - 20%) along the Cascades and the Sierra. The warming resulted in increased rainfall at the expense of reduced snowfall, and reduced snow accumulation ( or earlier snowmelt) during the cold season. In the CRB, these changes were accompanied by more frequent rain-on-snow events. Overall, they induced higher likelihood of wintertime flooding and reduced runoff and soil moisture in the summer. Changes in surface water and energy budgets in the CRB and SSJ basin were affected mainly by changes in surface temperature, which were statistically significant at the 0.95 confidence level. Changes in precipitation, while spatially incoherent, were not statistically significant except for the drying trend during summer. Because snow and runoff are highly sensitive to spatial distributions of temperature and precipitation, this study shows that ( 1) downscaling provides more realistic estimates of hydrologic impacts in mountainous regions such as the western U. S., and ( 2) despite relatively small changes in temperature and precipitation, changes in snowpack and runoff can be much larger on monthly to seasonal time scales because the effects of temperature and precipitation are integrated over time and space through various surface hydrological and land-atmosphere feedback processes. Although the results reported in this study were derived from an ensemble of regional climate simulations driven by a global climate model that displays low climate sensitivity compared with most other models, climate change was found to significantly affect water resources in the western U.

Annual weather patterns are cold in winter and mild in summer. Precipitation has high seasonal and interannual variation and may differ by an order of magnitude between geographically close locales, depending on slope, aspect and local climatic and orographic conditions. The region's hydrology is characterized by the accumulation of winter snow, spring snowmelt and autumnal baseflows. During the 2-3-month 'spring runoff period, rivers frequently discharge > 70% of their annual water budget and have instantaneous discharges 10-100 times mean low flow. Complex weather patterns characterized by high spatial and temporal variability make predictions of future conditions tenuous. However, general patterns are identifiable; northern and western portions of the region are dominated by maritime weather patterns from the North Pacific, central areas and eastern slopes are dominated by continental air masses and southern portions receive seasonally variable atmospheric circulation from the Pacific and the Gulf of Mexico. Significant interannual variations occur in these general patterns, possibly related to ENSO (El Nino-Southern Oscillation) forcing. Changes in precipitation and temperature regimes or patterns have significant potential effects on the distribution and abundance of plants and animals. For example, elevation of the timber-line is principally a function of temperature. Palaeolimnological investigations have shown significant shifts in phyto- and zoo-plankton populations as alpine lakes shift between being above or below the timber-line. Likewise, streamside vegetation has a significant effect on stream ecosystem structure and function. Changes in stream temperature regimes result in significant changes in community composition as a consequence of bioenergetic factors. Stenothermic species could be extirpated as appropriate thermal criteria disappear. Warming temperatures may geographically isolate cole water stream fishes in increasingly confined headwaters. The heat budgets of large lakes may be affected resulting in a change of state between dimictic and warm monomictic character. Uncertainties associated with prediction are increased by the planting of fish in historically fishless, high mountain lakes and the introduction of non-native species of fishes and invertebrates into often previously simple food-webs of large valley bottom lakes and streams. Many of the streams and rivers suffer from the anthropogenic effects of abstraction and regulation. Likewise, many of the large lakes receive nutrient loads from a growing human population. We concluded that: (1) regional climate models are required to resolve adequately the complexities of the high gradient landscapes; (2) extensive wilderness preserves and national park lands, so prevalent in the Rocky Mountain Region, provide sensitive areas for differentiation of anthropogenic effects from climate effects; and (3) future research should encompass both short-term intensive studies and long-term monitoring studies developed within comprehensive experimental arrays of streams and lakes specifically designed to address the issue of anthropogenic versus climatic effects.

In addition, we asked key individuals involved in drafting those policies to answer a short questionnaire. We found that research needs mainly concern impact and vulnerability assessments at regional and local levels, integrated assessments, and improved climate and socioeconomic data. These needs are often related to the challenges to data coverage and model performance in mountainous areas. In these areas, the base data are often riddled with gaps and uncertainties, making it particularly difficult to formulate adaptation strategies. In countries where data coverage is less of an issue, there is a tendency to explore quantitative forms of impact and vulnerability assessments.

We review the system of interactions among climate, competitors, fire, bark beetles, white pine blister rust (Cronartium ribicola), and seed dispersers that make WBP especially vulnerable to climate change. A well-formulated interagency management strategy has been developed for WBP, but it has only been implemented across <1% of the species GYE range. The challenges of complex climate effects and land allocation constraints on WBP management raises questions regarding the efficacy of restoration efforts for WBP in GYE. We evaluate six ecological mechanisms by which WBP may remain viable under climate change: climate microrefugia, climate tolerances, release from competition, favorable fire regimes, seed production prior to beetle-induced mortality, and blister-rust resistant trees. These mechanisms suggest that WBP viability may be higher than previously expected under climate change. Additional research is warranted on these mechanisms, which may provide a basis for increased management effectiveness. This review is used as a basis for deriving recommendations for other subalpine species threatened by climate change.",2016,Forestry,Review,climate change; Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem; resource management; policy; whitebark pine,web_of_science,Yes,,,,,,

Here we evaluate whether differences between projections based on comparable high emission pathways of a seven-member general circulation model CMIP3 versus CMIP5 ensemble change our understanding of the expected hydrologic impacts. This work focuses on the important snowmelt-dominated mountain runoff generating regions of the western United States (WUS; Upper Colorado River Basin (UCRB), Columbia River Basin (CRB), and Sierra Nevada (SN) Basins). Significant declines in snowmelt, and shifts in streamflow timing owing to warmer, wetter CMIP5 projections match or exceed those based on CMIP3 throughout the WUS. CMIP3- and CMIP5-based projections, while generally in agreement about hydroclimatic changes, differ in some important aspects for key regions. The most important is the UCRB, where CMIP5-based projections suggest increases in future streamflows. Comparable hydrologic projections result from similar underlying climate signals in CMIP3 and CMIP5 output for the CRB and SN, suggesting that previous work completed in these basins based on CMIP3 projections is likely still useful.

Therefore, the response of mountain snow hydrology to changes in air temperature and precipitation was examined by simulating a perturbed climate in Reynolds Mountain East (RME), a headwater catchment with a cool mountain climate in Idaho, USA. The cold regions hydrological model was used to calculate snow accumulation, wind redistribution by blowing snow, interception by forest canopies, sublimation and melt for 25 seasons in RME. The uncalibrated simulations of the highly redistributed snow water equivalent compared well to measurements. Results showed that with concomitant occurrence of warming (5 degrees C) and precipitation change (+/- 20%) in RME, the peak seasonal snow accumulation decreased by 84-90%, snowmelt decreased 51-79%, rainfall to total precipitation ratio increased from 30% to 78%, and overwinter blowing snow transport and sublimation losses from intercepted snow, the snow surface and blowing snow decreased dramatically. Warming causes an increase in inter-water year snowcover variability but a decrease in spatial snow accumulation variability. When warming exceeded 1 degrees C and a precipitation increased by less than 20%, the peak snow accumulation declined dramatically. The results contrast with those from further north along the North American Cordillera in Yukon, Canada, where the impacts of similar warming on alpine snow can be partly compensated for by concomitant increases in precipitation of less than 20%.

Hoary marmots (Marmota caligata) range throughout much of the mountainous Pacific Northwest (PNW) and Rocky Mountains while the closely related Olympic and Vancouver Island marmots (M. olympus and M. vancouverensis, respectively) are restricted to small isolated regions of the PNW. The endemic Vancouver Island marmot is currently classified as Critically Endangered and the Olympic marmot has recently experienced dramatic population declines. Previous phylogenetic studies of PNW marmot species have had limited power as they focused on resolving interspecific relationships, implicitly assumed an absence of gene flow among currently recognized species, included relatively few individuals, and relied heavily or entirely on mitochondrial DNA. We sequenced 2 mitochondrial and 4 nuclear markers from 167 hoary, 4 Vancouver Island, and 5 Olympic marmots in order to investigate phylogenetic relationships and historic gene flow among these species. We recovered 2 monophyletic (and predominantly allopatric) mitochondrial clades of hoary marmots that are not sister groups. Instead, Vancouver Island marmots formed a monophyletic mitochondrial sister clade to 1 of the hoary marmot clades. Nuclear loci did not recover the 2 mitochondrial clades of hoary marmots and suggest that Vancouver Island marmots may have experienced mitochondrial introgression from coastal mainland hoary marmots. Additionally, our nuclear results suggest possible gene flow between hoary and Olympic marmots despite different chromosomal formulas. Rather than resolving what has previously been considered a straightforward 3-taxon phylogenetic question, our findings suggest a complicated history of rapid divergence of the 3 species followed by intermittent and possibly ongoing gene flow between hoary marmots and both Olympic and Vancouver Island marmots. These results therefore have significant implications for the conservation of the latter 2 species, both of which are conservation concerns.",NA,NA,Article,alpine mammal; hoary marmot; Olympic marmot; Pacific Northwest; phylogenetics; Pleistocene refugia; Vancouver Island marmot,web_of_science,Yes,,,,,,

This interdisciplinary framework couples end users' data needs with observed, biophysical changes at local to regional scales.

Changes to water resources and wildfire risk were the highest areas of concern among resource professionals. Guided by the survey results, 15 biophysical indicator datasets were summarized that included direct climate metrics (e.g., air temperature) and indicators only partially influenced by climate (e.g., wildfire). Quantitative changes in indicators were determined using time series analysis from 1975 to 2010. Indicators displayed trends of varying likelihood over the analysis period, including increasing growing-season length, increasing annual temperature, increasing forest area burned, changing mountain bluebird and lilac phenology, increasing precipitation intensity, earlier center of timing of streamflow, and decreased 1 April snowpack; changes in volumetric streamflow, salmon migration dates, and stream temperature displayed the least likelihood.

Understanding these controls can be especially useful to construct robust predictions of how a species range may change in response to climate change or the extent to which a non-native species may spread in novel environments. Here, we link spatially intensive observations with mechanistic models to illustrate how physiology determines the upstream extent of the aquatic ectotherm smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) in two headwater rivers. Our results demonstrate that as temperatures become increasingly cold across a downstream to upstream gradient, food consumption in age 0 bass becomes increasingly constrained, and as a result, these fish become growth limited. Sufficient first summer growth of age 0 bass is essential for overwinter survival because young bass must persist from energy reserves accumulated during the summer, and those reserves are determined by body size. Our field data reveal the upstream extent of adult bass reproduction corresponds to a point in the downstream/upstream gradient where cold temperatures impair growth opportunities in young bass. This pattern was repeated in both study streams and explained why bass positioned nests twice as far upstream in the warm compared to the cold stream in the same basin. Placement of spawning nests by adult bass is likely subject to strong evolutionary selection in temperate systems: if bass spawn too far upstream, their young are unlikely to grow large enough to survive the winter. Consumption and growth in older bass (age 3-4) was far less sensitive to temperature. Based on these data, we suggest that temperature-sensitive age 0 bass constrain the upstream distribution limits of bass within temperate streams. In this study, we investigated how temperature-dependent physiology changed through the life history of a species and, in doing so, identified a climate-sensitive life-history stage that likely sets the distributional limits of all other life-history stages. We anticipate the framework developed here could be employed to identify how similar stage-specific environmental sensitivity determines distribution in many other ectothermic species.",NA,NA,Article,bioenergetic modelling; ectotherm; mechanistic species distribution modelling; Micropterus dolomieu; non-native species; smallmouth bass,web_of_science,Yes,,,,,,

Although ecological selection pressures have been theorized to play a key role in the stabilization of homoploid hybrid lineages, surprisingly few detailed quantitative studies compare the realized ecological niches of hybrids and their progenitors. In this study, we compare twenty bioclimatic variables (Worldclim) at representative occurrence sites of Abies grandis, Abies concolor, and two classes of their natural hybrids, which are variably intergradient between their progenitors, to assess the potential role of ecological selection in the evolution of the observed morphological patterns of introgression. We find that both hybrid classes occupy distinct habitats that are variably intermediate between those associated with A. grandis and A. concolor for a majority of environmental variables, but with lower precipitation in the summertime in the southern Cascade, Siskiyou, and Sierra Nevada Mountains than associated with either progenitor. We hypothesize that moisture stress and high levels of solar insolation in the summertime associated with hybrid populations have played an important role in the observed patterns of introgression of key traits: leaf angle, specific leaf area, and abundance of adaxial stomates. Phenotypic plasticity in two of these traits may allow hybrids to adapt to an environment with a higher degree of variability in moisture stress.

With spatial resolution often in the tens of kilometers, however, even RCM output will likely fail to resolve local topography that may be climatically significant in high-relief basins. Here we develop and apply an approach for downscaling RCM output using local topographic lapse rates (empirically-estimated spatially and seasonally variable changes in climate variables with elevation). We calculate monthly local topographic lapse rates from the 800-m Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) dataset, which is based on regressions of observed climate against topographic variables. We then use these lapse rates to elevationally correct two sources of regional climate-model output: (1) the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR), a retrospective dataset produced from a regional forecasting model constrained by observations, and (2) a range of baseline climate scenarios from the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP), which is produced by a series of RCMs driven by GCMs. By running a calibrated and validated hydrologic model, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), using observed station data and elevationally-adjusted NARR and NARCCAP output, we are able to estimate the sensitivity of hydrologic modeling to the source of the input climate data.

A well-established hydrological model, the University of British Columbia (UBC) watershed model, is selected and applied in five different river basins located in Canada, Cyprus, and Pakistan. Catchments from cold, temperate, continental, and semiarid climate zones are included to demonstrate the procedures developed. Two methodologies for streamflow modelling are proposed and analysed. The first method uses the UBC watershed model with a universal set of parameters for water allocation and flow routing, and precipitation gradients estimated from the available annual precipitation data as well as from regional information on the distribution of orographic precipitation. This method is proposed for watersheds without streamflow gauge data and limited meteorological station data. The second hybrid method proposes the coupling of UBC watershed model with artificial neural networks (ANNs) and is intended for use in poorly gauged watersheds which have limited streamflow measurements. The two proposed methods have been applied to five mountainous watersheds with largely varying climatic, physiographic, and hydrological characteristics. The evaluation of the applied methods is based on the combination of graphical results, statistical evaluation metrics, and normalized goodness-of-fit statistics. The results show that the first method satisfactorily simulates the observed hydrograph assuming that the basins are ungauged.

Five study sites were located in mature forest stands along an elevation gradient from the Pacific coast to the west slope of the Cascade Mountains (similar to 1200 m) in Oregon, USA. Maximum daily air temperature (T) and W were similar in relative importance to tree growth at four of the five sites. W was substantially more important at one site. Growth rate increased with T to an optimum (T-opt) and decreased with higher T. At the two drier sites T and W affected growth interactively in that T-opt decreased with decreasing W. We conclude that both T and W affect growth and that T consistently limits growth at three of the five sites and at all sites in years with above average summer temperature.

Environmental classification is a first step towards quantifying these tradeoffs by creating the framework necessary for analysing the effects of flow variability on riverine biota. Our study presents a spatially explicit hydrogeomorphic classification of streams and rivers in Washington State, USA and investigates how projected climate change is likely to affect flow regimes in the future. We calculated 99 hydrologic metrics from 15?years of continuous daily discharge data for 64 gauges with negligible upstream impact, which were entered into a Bayesian mixture model to classify flow regimes into seven major classes described by their dominant flow source as follows: groundwater (GW), rainfall (RF), rain-with-snow (RS), snow-and-rain (SandR), snow-with-rain (SR), snowmelt (SM) and ultra-snowmelt (US). The largest class sizes were represented by the transitional RS and SandR classes (14 and 12 gauges, respectively), which are ubiquitous in temperate, mountainous landscapes found in Washington. We used a recursive partitioning algorithm and random forests to predict flow class based on a suite of environmental and climate variables. Overall classification success was 75%, and the model was used to predict normative flow classes at the reach scale for the entire state. Application of future climate change scenarios to the model inputs indicated shifts of varying magnitude from snow-dominated to rain-dominated flow classes. Lastly, a geomorphic classification was developed using a digital elevation model (DEM) and climatic data to assign stream segments as either dominantly able or unable to migrate, which was cross-tabulated with the flow types to produce a 14-tier hydrogeomorphic classification. The hydrogeomorphic classification provides a framework upon which empirical flow alterationecological response relationships can subsequently be developed using ecological information collected throughout the region.

World-wide extinctions of amphibians are at the forefront of the biodiversity crisis, with climate change figuring prominently as a potential driver of continued amphibian decline. As in other taxa, changes in both the mean and variability of climate conditions may affect amphibian populations in complex, unpredictable ways. In western North America, climate models predict a reduced duration and extent of mountain snowpack and increased variability in precipitation, which may have consequences for amphibians inhabiting montane ecosystems. 2. We used Bayesian capturerecapture methods to estimate survival and transition probabilities in a high-elevation population of the Columbia spotted frog (Rana luteiventris) over 10 years and related these rates to interannual variation in peak snowpack. Then, we forecasted frog population growth and viability under a range of scenarios with varying levels of change in mean and variance in snowpack. 3. Over a range of future scenarios, changes in mean snowpack had a greater effect on viability than changes in the variance of snowpack, with forecasts largely predicting an increase in population viability. Population models based on snowpack during our study period predicted a declining population. 4. Although mean conditions were more important for viability than variance, for a given mean snowpack depth, increases in variability could change a population from increasing to decreasing. Therefore, the influence of changing climate variability on populations should be accounted for in predictive models. The Bayesian modelling framework allows for the explicit characterization of uncertainty in parameter estimates and ecological forecasts, and thus provides a natural approach for examining relative contributions of mean and variability in climatic variables to population dynamics. 5. Longevity and heterogeneous habitat may contribute to the potential for this amphibian species to be resilient to increased climatic variation, and shorter-lived species inhabiting homogeneous ecosystems may be more susceptible to increased variability in climate conditions.",2012,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Zoology,Article,capture-recapture analysis; climate change; ecological forecasting; population viability analysis; Rana luteiventris; snow-water equivalence,web_of_science,Yes,,,,,,

A large proportion of the landscape falls into one of several categories of protected lands. However, protected lands in the region are primarily higher elevation forest and mountain habitats. Little is known about how the network of protected lands may maintain connectivity for a broad spectrum of species expressing different habitat requirements and dispersal abilities. Location The study was conducted across the states of Montana and northern Idaho, USA, comprising an area of 30.2 million hectares. Methods We used resistant kernel modelling to map the extent of the study area predicted to be connected by dispersal for each of 35 species groups with different ecological associations. We evaluated the effect of vagility on protected area sufficiency by varying dispersal ability across three levels for each species group. We evaluated the degree of vulnerability of each of the 105 hypothetical species (35 species groups x 3 dispersal abilities) in terms of the extent of the total study area predicted to be connected by dispersal. We defined nine categories of risk as the combination of species vulnerability because of the extent of connected habitat and the degree to which that habitat was protected. Results We found high variation in the vulnerability of species because of the extent of connected habitat, and the extent to which connected habitat overlapped protected lands. Species associated with high elevations and species associated with lower elevations were predicted to have limited extent of connected habitat. Species associated with high elevations were predicted to have the vast majority of their connected habitat protected by federal Forest Service and National Park Service lands. In contrast, species associated with lower elevations were poorly protected by the existing network of protected lands. Main conclusions Low elevation and non-forest habitats are at highest risk of human-induced habitat loss and fragmentation in the study area. Conservation efforts in the region may be most effective if they focus on expanding the network of lower elevation protected lands in such a way that maximizes connectivity across the landscape.",2012,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Article,Connectivity; dispersal threshold; gap analysis; protected lands,web_of_science,Yes,,,,,,

Recent methods to improve both the resolution and accuracy of interpolation models have focused on the development of ""up-sampling"" algorithms based on local lapse rate adjustments to the original interpolated surfaces. Lapse rates can be derived from statistical models (e.g., elevation-based polynomial regression equations) or dynamical models (e.g., vertical temperature profiles from numerical weather prediction (NWP) models). This study compares a widely used statistical up-sampling algorithm, ClimateBC, with two NWP reanalysis products, the National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Corporation for Atmospheric Research, Reanalysis 1 (NCEP1) and the more modern European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis Interim (ERA-Interim). Thirty-year climate normals for maximum and minimum temperatures were calculated using statistical up-sampling and NWP lapse rate adjustments to existing PRISM-based climate normals at a subset of stations in BC. Specifically, up-sampling model evaluation was performed using 1951-80 climate normals from an independent set of 54 surface stations (1 m to 2347 m) which were not included in the PRISM interpolation or assimilated into the NWP reanalysis products. All models performed similarly for minimum temperature, which showed only a slight improvement over PRISM. For maximum temperature, ClimateBC, NCEP1 and ERA-Interim all performed significantly better than PRISM, in particular during spring and summer. The ERA-Interim reanalysis outperformed NCEP1 in almost all months.

We studied the current state and potential causes of fragmentation in grizzly bears over approximately 1,000,000 km(2) of western Canada, the northern United States (US), and southeast Alaska. We compiled much of our data from projects undertaken with a variety of research objectives including population estimation and trend, landscape fragmentation, habitat selection, vital rates, and response to human development. Our primary analytical techniques stemmed from genetic analysis of 3,134 bears, supplemented with radiotelemetry data from 792 bears. We used 15 locus microsatellite data coupled with measures of genetic distance, isolation-by-distance (IBD) analysis, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), linear multiple regression, multi-factorial correspondence analysis (to identify population divisions or fractures with no a priori assumption of group membership), and population-assignment methods to detect individual migrants between immediately adjacent areas. These data corroborated observations of inter-area movements from our telemetry database. In northern areas, we found a spatial genetic pattern of IBD, although there was evidence of natural fragmentation from the rugged heavily glaciated coast mountains of British Columbia (BC) and the Yukon. These results contrasted with the spatial pattern of fragmentation in more southern parts of their distribution. Near the Canada-US border area, we found extensive fragmentation that corresponded to settled mountain valleys and major highways. Genetic distances across developed valleys were elevated relative to those across undeveloped valleys in central and northern BC. In disturbed areas, most inter-area movements detected were made by male bears, with few female migrants identified. Northsouth movements within mountain ranges (Mts) and across BC Highway 3 were more common than eastwest movements across settled mountain valleys separating Mts. Our results suggest that relatively distinct subpopulations exist in this region, including the Cabinet, Selkirk South, and the decades-isolated Yellowstone populations. Current movement rates do not appear sufficient to consider the subpopulations we identify along the Canada-US border as 1 inter-breeding unit. Although we detected enough male movement to mediate gene flow, the current low rate of female movement detected among areas is insufficient to provide a demographic rescue effect between areas in the immediate future (0-15 yr). In Alberta, we found fragmentation corresponded to major eastwest highways (Highways 3, 11, 16, and 43) and most inter-area movements were made by males. Gene flow and movement rates between Alberta and BC were highest across the Continental Divide south of Highway 1 and north of Highway 16. In the central region between Highways 1 and 11, we found evidence of natural fragmentation associated with the extensive glaciers and icefields along the Continental Divide. The discontinuities that we identified would form appropriate boundaries for management units. We related sex-specific movement rates between adjacent areas to several metrics of human use (highway traffic, settlement, and human-caused mortality) to understand the causes of fragmentation. This analysis used data from 1,508 bears sampled over a 161,500-km(2) area in southeastern BC, western Alberta, northern Idaho, and northern Montana during 1979-2007. This area was bisected by numerous humantransportation and settlement corridors of varying intensity and complexity. We used multiple linear regression and ANCOVA to document the responses of female and male bears to disturbance. Males and females both demonstrated reduced movement rates with increasing settlement and traffic. However, females reduced their movement rates dramatically when settlement increased to >20% of the fracture zone. At this same threshold, male movement declined more gradually, in response to increased traffic and further settlement. In highly settled areas (>50%), both sexes had a similar reduction in movements in response to traffic, settlement, and mortality. We documented several small bear populations with male-only immigration, highlighting the importance of investigating sex-specific movements. Without female connectivity, small populations are not viable over the long term. The persistence of this regional female fragmented metapopulation likely will require strategic connectivity management. We therefore recommend enhancing female connectivity among fractured areas by securing linkage-zone habitat appropriate for female dispersal, and ensuring current large source subpopulations remain intact. The fragmentation we documented may also affect other species with similar ecological characteristics: sparse densities, slow reproduction, short male-biased dispersal, and a susceptibility to human-caused mortality and habitat degradation. Therefore, regional inter-jurisdictional efforts to manage broad landscapes for inter-area movement will likely benefit a broad spectrum of species and natural processes, particularly in light of climate change.

At each location we derived monthly indices representative of anticyclonicity using NCEP/NCAR 700 hPa reanalysis pressure fields. The number of anticyclonic days minus cyclonic days (A-C) is positively correlated with temperature anomalies at exposed convex sites and in the north of the domain where the free atmosphere controls temperature, anticyclonic months being warmer. In topographic concavities, and in the south of the domain where the influence of upper air ridges and troughs is muted, the relationship is much weaker. We use the gradient of the A-C index-temperature relationship to represent a coupling index, highest at exposed free-air locations. On a mean annual basis there are no strong relationships between temperature trend magnitude, elevation, topographic incision, or coupling index. However, in winter, warming is weaker at decoupled locations, especially when snow cover is present. Where snow is absent in winter, and in fall, the relationship is reversed. Circulation changes (increased cyclonicity) can explain the disparity in warming between decoupled and exposed locations in fall and to a certain extent in winter (increased anticyclonicity), although winter results are also regionally sensitive. Thus, future climate change may be different (amplified or muted dependent on season and/or surface characteristics) in locations prone to surface decoupling, compared with locations exposed to the free atmosphere. Understanding such processes will aid downscaling of future climate change.",2011,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Article,NA,web_of_science,Yes,,,,,,

Most populations are currently declining, and some face extirpation. In southern Canada, caribou range has retreated considerably over the past century. The ultimate reason for their decline is habitat alterations by industrial activities. The proximate causes are predation and, to a lesser extent, overharvest. The most southerly populations of ""Mountain"" caribou are at imminent risk of extirpation. Mountain caribou are threatened by similar industrial activities as Boreal caribou, and face increasing harassment from motorized winter recreational activities. Most populations of ""Migratory Tundra"" caribou are currently declining. Although these caribou fluctuate in abundance over decades, changing harvest technologies, climate change, increasing industrial development and human presence in the North raise doubts over whether recent declines will be followed by recoveries. The Peary caribou (Rangifer tarandus pearyi J.A. Allen, 1902), a distinct subspecies endemic to Canada's High Arctic, has suffered drastic declines caused by severe weather, hunting and predation. It faces an increasing threat from climate change. While some questions remain about the reasons for the decline of Migratory Tundra caribou, research has clearly identified several threats to the persistence of ""Boreal"", Mountain, and Peary caribou.

We evaluated relationships among local climate variables, annual survival and fecundity, and population growth rates from a 9-year demographic study of Columbia spotted frogs (Rana luteiventris) in the Bitterroot Mountains of Montana. We documented an increase in survival and breeding probability as severity of winter decreased. Therefore, a warming climate with less severe winters is likely to promote population viability in this montane frog population. More generally, amphibians and other ectotherms inhabiting alpine or boreal habitats at or near their thermal ecological limits may benefit from the milder winters provided by a warming climate as long as suitable habitats remain intact.

Ruby",Downscaling hydroclimatic changes over the Western US based on CAM subgrid scheme and WRF regional climate simulations,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY,"This study examines two dynamical downscaling methods, a subgrid parameterization and a regional climate model, to compare their impacts on simulating orographic precipitation and surface hydrology in mountain regions. A global climate model was first applied at 1 degrees x 1.25 degrees grid resolution with a subgrid orographic precipitation scheme. The global simulations were then used to drive a regional climate model at 15-km grid resolution over the Western United States. By comparing the global and regional simulations for two 10-year periods, 1993-2003 and 2039-2049, this study assesses the two downscaling methods in the context of simulating both the present climate and climate change signals. and the implications of the relatively short simulation length to investigate differences in current and future climate simulated by the models are discussed. The model results show that improving the representation of surface topography through higher spatial resolution or a subgrid method has a large impact on the simulations. Both the subgrid scheme and the regional model significantly improved the simulation of snowpack in the mountains. The spatial distributions of precipitation and snowpack are generally consistent between the subgrid and regional simulations, since they were driven by the same large-scale circulation from the global simulations. However, because rain-shadow effects are not represented in the subgrid scheme, the regional simulations produced much more realistic spatial variability in precipitation and snowpack than the subgrid simulations in narrow mountain ranges. In the climate change experiments, both downscaling procedures preserved the large-scale patterns of temperature and precipitation changes in the global simulations. However, the regional simulations show larger changes in precipitation and snowpack along the coastal mountains than the subgrid simulations. This is attributed to the fact that the regional model explicitly simulates the interactions of atmospheric circulation and the underlying topography, so changes in wind directions with respect to the orientations of the mountains may lead to changes in orographic precipitation that cannot he explained by changes in atmospheric temperature and moisture alone. Hence differences between the precipitation changes simulated by the regional model and the subgrid method are larger in narrow mountains such as the Cascades and the Sierra Nevada because the subgrid method does not account for the influence of mountain orientations at the subgrid scale. As precipitation is an important driver of surface hydrological processes, differences between the precipitation changes simulated by the two methods lead to important differences in the surface hydrological processes under climate change.

Using PRISM climate and productivity data measured on a grid of 3356 plots, we developed a simultaneous autoregressive (SAR) model to estimate the impacts of climate change on potential productivity of Pacific Northwest (PNW) forests of the United States. Productivity, measured by projected potential mean annual increment (PMAI) at culmination, is explained by the interaction of annual temperature, precipitation, and precipitation in excess of evapotranspiration through the growing season. By utilizing information regarding spatial error in the SAR model, the resulting spatial bias is reduced thereby improving the accuracy of the resulting maps. The model, coupled with climate change output from four generalized circulation models, was used to predict the productivity impacts of four different scenarios derived from the fourth IPCC special report on emissions, representing different future economic and environmental states of the world, viz., scenario A1B, A2, B1 (low growth, high economic development and low energy usage), and COMMIT. In these scenarios, regional average temperature is expected to increase from 0.5 to 4.5 degrees C, while precipitation shows no clear trend over time. For the west and east side of the Cascade Mountains, respectively, PMAI increases: 7% and 20% under A1B scenario: 8% and 23% under scenario A2; 5% and 15% under scenario B1, and 2% and 5% under the COMMIT scenario. These projections should be viewed as potential changes in productivity, since they do not reflect the mitigating effects of any shifts in management or public policy.

This basic understanding is also providing a foundation for predicting and managing the consequences of climate change on ecosystems, including their resilience to disturbance, biotic diversity, and carbon and nutrient dynamics. To help address the challenges of climate change, future soil ecology research and management would benefit from a complex systems approach, where network and dynamics systems theory are used to predict plant community and ecosystem responses to disturbance. A reductionist approach to management that ignores networks and system dynamics, by contrast, is destined to contribute to ecological degradation as climate changes. In this paper, I describe mycorrhizal networks as models of biological networks in the interior Douglas-fir forests of British Columbia, and the role they play in carbon flux and regeneration dynamics following disturbance. I propose a conservationist approach for managing forest mycorrhizal networks and hub trees that can facilitate native plant migrations, limit exotic plant invasions, and bolster ecological resilience.

We used a diagnostic set of class and landscape spatial pattern metrics to compare current spatial patterns of test subwatersheds against the two sets of reference conditions. in a companion decision support model built with the EMDS modeling system, we considered the degree of departure in the subwatersheds, relative to the two sets of reference conditions along with two additional criteria (vulnerability to severe wildfire and timber harvest opportunity), to determine the relative priority of landscape restoration treatments, and the potential for timber harvest to underwrite the treatments. In the decision support model, the current spatial pattern conditions of physiognomic types, cover types, forest structural classes, and those of late-successional and old forest patches of the two subwatersheds were compared against the two sets of reference conditions. The degree of departure in spatial patterns of physiognomic conditions was moderate in both subwatersheds in the pre-management era and climate-change comparisons. The situation was similar for the cover-type departure analysis, but spatial patterns of cover types increased in similarity to the reference conditions in the western subwatershed under the climate-change scenario. Spatial patterns of structural conditions showed a high degree of departure in both subwatersheds when compared to either set of reference conditions, but similarity improved in the eastern subwatershed under the climate-change scenario. Spatial patterns of late-successional + old forest structure were strongly similar to the broad envelope of conditions represented by the pre-management era reference in the western and moderately similar in the eastern subwatershed, but declined in both subwatersheds when compared with the climate-change reference conditions. When the degree of departure in spatial patterns of all patch types was considered along with vulnerability to severe wildfire and timber harvest opportunity, the eastern subwatershed rated higher priority for landscape improvement using either set of reference conditions. We conclude by considering uncertainties inherent in the analysis approach, types of sensitivity analysis needed to investigate model performance, and broad implications for forest managers.

We used a combination of biophysically informed sampling ( to identify sample sites) and dendroclimatology ( to identify growth - climate relationships) along a climate gradient in northwestern United States mountain ecosystems from the western Olympic Peninsula, Washington to the eastern Rocky Mountain Front, Montana. We used a multi- scale sampling strategy that accounted for continentality, physiography, and topography as non- climatic factors that could in. uence climate and alter tree growth. We developed a network of 124 Douglas-. r tree- ring chronologies and explored growth - climate correlations across the sampled gradients. We considered two different spatial scales of monthly and seasonal climate variables as potential controlling factors on tree growth. Annual radial growth in 60 - 65% of the plots across the region is signi. cantly correlated with precipitation, drought, or water balance during the late summer prior to growth and the early summer the year of growth. In a few plots, growth is positively correlated with cool- season temperature or negatively correlated with snowpack. Water availability is therefore more commonly limiting to Douglas-. r growth than energy limitations on growing season length. The. rst principal component derived from the chronologies is signi. cantly correlated with independent drought reconstructions. The sensitivity of Douglas-. r to summer water balance de. cit ( potential evapotranspiration minus actual evapotranspiration) indicates that increases in April to September temperature without increases in summer precipitation or soil moisture reserves are likely to cause decreases in growth over much of the sampled area, especially east of the Cascade crest. In contrast, Douglas-. r may exhibit growth increases at some higher elevation sites where seasonal photosynthesis is currently limited by growing- season length or low growing- season temperature.

Understanding past changes and anticipating future changes under different potential management scenarios are fundamental to developing ecologically based fuel reduction or ecological restoration treatments. Some of the many changes that have occurred in these forests include shifts from historically frequent surface fire to no fire or to stand-replacing fire regimes, increases in tree density, increased abundance of fire-intolerant trees, decreases in understory productivity, hydrological alterations, and accelerated mortality of old trees. Although these changes are widespread, the magnitude and causes of changes may vary within and among landscapes. Agents of change, such as fire exclusion or livestock grazing, likely interacted and had multiple effects. For example, historical ranching operations may have altered both fire regimes and understory vegetation, and facilitated institutional fire exclusion through fragmentation and settlement. Evidence exists for large variation in presettlement characteristics and current condition of old growth across this broad forest region, although there are many examples of striking similarities on widely distant landscapes. Exotic species, climate change, unnatural stand-replacing wildfires, and other factors will likely continue to degrade or eradicate old growth in many areas. As a policy of fire exclusion is proving to be unsustainable, mechanical tree thinning, prescribed fire, or wildland fire use will likely be key options for forestalling continued eradication of old growth by severe crown fires. For many practical and societal reasons, the wildland-urban interface may afford some of the most immediate opportunities for re-establishing old growth typical of presettlement forests resistant to crown fires.",2007,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Article,ecological restoration; evolutionary environment; mixed conifer; management; Pinus jeffreyi; Pinus ponderosa; range of variability; Sequoia giganteum,web_of_science,Yes,,,,,,

Historic weather records were used to produce maps of the distribution of past climatically suitable habitats for mountain pine beetles in British Columbia. Overlays of annual mountain pine beetle occurrence on these maps were used to determine if the beetle has expanded its range in recent years due to changing climate. An examination of the distribution of climatically suitable habitats in 10-year increments derived from climate normals (1921-1950 to 1971-2000) clearly shows an increase in the range of benign habitats. Furthermore, an increase (at an increasing rate) in the number of infestations since 1970 in formerly climatically unsuitable habitats indicates that mountain pine beetle populations have expanded into these new areas.

Trends during the 20th century in annually averaged temperature (0.7degreesC-0.9degreesC) and precipitation (13%-38%) exceed the global averages. Largest warming rates occurred in the maritime zone and in winter and at lower elevations in all zones, and smallest warming rates occurred in autumn and in the Rockies. Largest increases in precipitation (upwards of 60% per century) were observed in the dry areas in northeast Washington and south central British Columbia. Increases in precipitation were largest in spring, but were also large in summer in the central and Rocky Mountain climatic zones. These trends have already had profound impacts on streamflow and on certain plant species in the region (Cayan et al. 2001), and other important impacts remain to be discovered.

We measured the influence of fire severity, defined as vegetation disturbance (using a satellite-derived vegetation disturbance index, VDI), landscape features that organize hydrologic flow pathways (relief and elongation ratios), and pre-fire vegetation type on the probability of the occurrence of post-fire gully rejuvenation (GR). We combined field surveys across 270 burned low-order catchments (112 occurrences of GR) and geospatial analysis to generate a probabilistic model through logistic regression. VDI alone discriminated well between catchments where GR did and did not occur (area under the curve=0.78, model accuracy=0.72). The strong effect of vegetation disturbance on GR suggests that vegetation exerts a primary influence on the occurrence of infiltration excess run-off and post-fire erosion and that major gully erosion will not occur until fire consumes aboveground biomass. Other topographic and local factors also influenced GR response, including catchment elongation, per cent pre-fire shrub, mid-slope riparian vegetation, armoured headwaters, firehose effects, and concentration of severe burn in source areas. These factors highlight the need to consider vegetation effects in concert with local topography and site conditions to understand the propensity for flow accumulation leading to GR. We present a process-based conceptual hydrologic model where vegetation loss from fire decreases rainfall attenuation and surface roughness, leading to accelerated flow accumulation and erosion; these effects are also influenced by interactions between fire severity and landscape structure. The VDI metric provides a continuous measure of vegetation disturbance and, when placed in a hydrologic context, may improve quantitative analysis of burned-area susceptibility to erosive rainfall, hazard prediction, ecological effects of fire, landform evolution, and sensitivity to climate change.

The two sites share remarkably similar vegetation, topography, and climate and differ only in bedrock permeability (one poorly permeable volcanic rock and the other more permeable sandstone). We found longer MTTs in the catchments with more permeable fractured and weathered sandstone bedrock than in the catchments with tight, volcanic bedrock (on average, 6.2 versus 1.8 years, respectively). At the permeable bedrock site, 67% of the variance in MTT across catchments scales was explained by drainage area, with no significant correlation to topographic characteristics. The poorly permeable site had opposite scaling relations, where MTT showed no correlation to drainage area but the ratio of median flow path length to median flow path gradient explained 91% of the variance in MTT across seven catchment scales. Despite these differences, hydrometric analyses, including flow duration and recession analysis, and storm response analysis, show that the two sites share relatively indistinguishable hydrodynamic behavior.

P.",Detectability of change in winter precipitation within mountain landscapes: Spatial patterns and uncertainty,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Detecting long-term change in seasonal precipitation using ground observations is dependent on the representativity of the point measurement to the surrounding landscape. In mountainous regions, representativity can be poor and lead to large uncertainties in precipitation estimates at high elevations or in areas where observations are sparse. If the uncertainty in the estimate is large compared to the long-term shifts in precipitation, then the change will likely go undetected. In this analysis, we examine the minimum detectable change across mountainous terrain in western Montana, USA. We ask the question: What is the minimum amount of change that is necessary to be detected using our best estimates of precipitation in complex terrain? We evaluate the spatial uncertainty in the precipitation estimates by conditioning historic regional climate model simulations to ground observations using Bayesian inference. By using this uncertainty as a null hypothesis, we test for detectability across the study region. To provide context for the detectability calculations, we look at a range of future scenarios from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) multimodel ensemble downscaled to 4 km resolution using the MACAv2-METDATA data set. When using the ensemble averages we find that approximately 65% of the significant increases in winter precipitation go undetected at midelevations. At high elevation, approximately 75% of significant increases in winter precipitation are undetectable. Areas where change can be detected are largely controlled by topographic features. Elevation and aspect are key characteristics that determine whether or not changes in winter precipitation can be detected. Furthermore, we find that undetected increases in winter precipitation at high elevation will likely remain as snow under climate change scenarios. Therefore, there is potential for these areas to offset snowpack loss at lower elevations and confound the effects of climate change on water resources.

We examined resting metabolic rate, surface activity, and den and ambient temperatures (T-a) of pikas in late summer (August 2011 and 2012) at 2 locations in the Rocky Mountains. Resting metabolic rate was calculated to be 2.02 mL O-2 . g(-1)h(-1), with a lower critical temperature (LCT) of 28.1 +/- 0.2 degrees C. No upper critical temperature (UCT) could be determined from our data; therefore, the estimated thermoneutral zone (TNZ) was 28.1 degrees C to at least 35.0 degrees C (upper experimental temperature). Pikas in this study showed the same bimodal above-talus activity patterns reported in previous studies. Den temperatures in Colorado were correlated with, but consistently lower than, current ambient temperatures. Wyoming den temperatures showed a weak correlation with T-a 20 min prior to the current den temperature.

However, floodplain habitat mosaics are subject to other important landscape-scale disturbance regimes. In the Rocky Mountains of the USA and Canada, fire also affects floodplain habitat patch composition. The floodplain exists at the intersection of disturbance regimes that shape the riverscape and those that shape the landscape. We extended the shifting habitat mosaic concept by examining the effects of multiple disturbance elements on habitat patch composition across the aquatic-terrestrial ecotone of the North Fork of the Flathead River, a free-flowing river in southeastern British Columbia, Canada, and northwestern Montana, USA. We used remotely sensed imagery, meteorological records, empirical and modeled rainfall-runoff data, extent and frequency of past wildfires, and anthropogenic landuse data for 1991-2013 to examine the relationships among hydrology, fire, landuse, geomorphic position, and floodplain habitat patch dynamics.

Stand-replacing wildfires create opportunities for establishment of tree-species cohorts and can catalyze rapid shifts in where species occur, facilitating unique opportunities for long-term study. We quantified effects of multiple ecological filters on a colonizing cohort of aspen (Populus tremuloides) that established from seed throughout burned lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia) forests after the 1988 fires in Yellowstone National Park (Wyoming, USA) to ask: (1) How have aspen presence, density, and size varied across the postfire landscape, and what filters explain these spatial and temporal patterns? (2) How does aspen above-and belowground biomass vary with postfire lodgepole-pine density? Aspen persisted to postfire year 25 in 58% of the plots in which aspen were present in postfire year 11 (n = 45), and mean stem density declined from 522 to 310 stems ha(-1). Mean aspen height doubled (from 29 to 59 cm) over this period. Ecological filters related to climate, competition, herbivory, and soils all differentially affected aspen presence, persistence, and size. Growing season temperature, inter-specific competition, and herbivory also changed through time, altering their effects on the colonizing cohort, and shifting where on the landscape aspen persistence and growth were ultimately favored. Eleven years postfire, aspen were favored at warmer, low elevations; ungulate browsing strongly constrained aspen heights; and competition was unimportant. By 25-years postfire, temperatures warmed nearly 1 degrees C, and aspen were more likely to persist at cooler, high elevations. Browsing pressure declined, as ungulate populations decreased during this time, but aspen height and basal diameters were constrained by dense, rapidly growing postfire conifers. Landscape mosaics of ecological filters shift over space and time and can facilitate or constrain the persistence and growth of colonizing species. Long-term study of post-disturbance colonizing cohorts uniquely reveal how species are responding to real-time environmental change in heterogeneous landscapes, which will help us better anticipate 21st century species distributions and abundances.

The climatic changes expected during the next decades - large increases in mean temperature, increased heat waves, and significant long-term regional drying in the western USA - will likely increase chronic forest stress and mortality. The aim of this research is to develop and apply a new forest vulnerability index (FVI) associated with drought and high temperatures across the Pacific Northwest region (PNW; Oregon and Washington) of the USA during the MODIS Aqua era (since 2003). Our technique incorporates the alterations to canopy water and energy exchange processes caused by drought and high temperatures with spatially continuous MODIS land surface temperature (LST) and evapotranspiration (ET), and with Parameter-elevation Relationships on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) precipitation (P) data. With P and ET, we calculate a monthly water balance variable for each individual pixel normalized by forest type group (FTG), and then difference the water balance with the corresponding normalized monthly meanLST to calculate a monthly forest stress index (FSI). We then extract the pixel-specific (800-m resolution) statistically significant temporal trends of the FSI from 2003 to 2012 by month (April to October). The FVI is the slope of the monthly FSI across years, such that there is a FVI for each month. Statistically significant positive slopes indicate interannual increases in stress leading to expected forest vulnerability (positive FVI) for a given month. Positive FVI values were concentrated in the months of August and September, with peak vulnerability occurring at different times for different FTGs. Overall, increased vulnerability rates were the highest in drier FTGs such as Ponderosa Pine, Juniper, and Lodgepole Pine. Western Larch and Fir/Spruce/Mountain Hemlock groups occupy moister sites but also had relatively high proportion of positive FVI values. The Douglas-fir group had the second largest total area of increased vulnerability due to its large areal extent in the study area. Based on an analysis using imagery viewed in Google Earth, we confirm that areas with increased vulnerability are associated with greater amounts of stress and mortality. The FVI is a new way to conceptualize and monitor forest vulnerability based on first-order principles and has the potential to be generalized to other geographical areas. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The major source of freshwater in the region originates from the melt of high-elevation snowpacks, about which little is currently known, including the proportion of the peak snowpack lost to sublimation. To better understand the hydrologic regime of this snow resource, a detailed field program was conducted during the 2007 snowmelt season. Specifically, peak annual snow distribution, ablation-season surface-energy exchange and mass balance were measured in a forested high-elevation catchment of the Okanagan Basin. During the snowmelt period, 1-4% of the peak annual snow-water equivalent (SWE) was lost to sublimation in open sites - averaging 0.4 mm d<sup xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">-1</sup>. Melt and sublimation rates increased significantly with elevation, and were observed to be higher and more variable in the open sites than under forest canopies.

A.",Effects of increased soil water availability on grassland ecosystem carbon dioxide fluxes.,Biogeochemistry,"There is considerable interest in how ecosystems will respond to changes in precipitation. Alterations in rain and snowfall are expected to influence the spatio-temporal patterns of plant and soil processes that are controlled by soil moisture, and potentially, the amount of carbon (C) exchanged between the atmosphere and ecosystems. Because grasslands cover over one third of the terrestrial landscape, understanding controls on grassland C processes will be important to forecast how changes in precipitation regimes will influence the global C cycle. In this study we examined how irrigation affects carbon dioxide (CO<sub xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">2</sub>) fluxes in five widely variable grasslands of Yellowstone National Park during a year of approximately average growing season precipitation. We irrigated plots every 2 weeks with 25% of the monthly 30-year average of precipitation resulting in plots receiving approximately 150% of the usual growing season water in the form of rain and supplemented irrigation. Ecosystem CO<sub xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">2</sub> fluxes were measured with a closed chamber-system once a month from May-September on irrigated and unirrigated plots in each grassland. Soil moisture was closely associated with CO<sub xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">2</sub> fluxes and shoot biomass, and was between 1.6% and 11.5% higher at the irrigated plots (values from wettest to driest grassland) during times of measurements. When examining the effect of irrigation throughout the growing season (May-September) across sites, we found that water additions increased ecosystem CO<sub xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">2</sub> fluxes at the two driest and the wettest sites, suggesting that these sites were water-limited during the climatically average precipitation conditions of the 2005 growing season. In contrast, no consistent responses to irrigation were detected at the two sites with intermediate soil moisture. Thus, the ecosystem CO<sub xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">2</sub> fluxes at those sites were not water-limited, when considering their responses to supplemental water throughout the whole season. In contrast, when we explored how the effect of irrigation varied temporally, we found that irrigation increased ecosystem CO<sub xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">2</sub> fluxes at all the sites late in the growing season (September). The spatial differences in the response of ecosystem CO<sub xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">2</sub> fluxes to irrigation likely can be explained by site specific differences in soil and vegetation properties. The temporal effects likely were due to delayed plant senescence that promoted plant and soil activity later into the year. Our results suggest that in Yellowstone National Park, above-normal amounts of soil moisture will only stimulate CO<sub xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">2</sub> fluxes across a portion of the ecosystem. Thus, depending on the topographic location, grassland CO<sub xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">2</sub> fluxes can be water-limited or not.

Currently, we have little understanding of how the importance of the storage effect varies among ecosystems. We tested for the three conditions of the storage effect in a sagebrush steppe plant community in Idaho (USA) by combining long-term observational data with statistical models. The four sagebrush steppe species that we studied satisfied the first two conditions of the storage effect: a long-lived life stage and species-specific responses to the environment. But the critical third condition, environment-competition covariance, was very weak in this community. While the direction of the covariance was consistent with a stabilizing effect of variability (stronger competition in more favorable years), its magnitude was small, reflecting low temporal variability in both competition and species responses to the environment. Consistent with this result, simulations of species population growth rates when rare showed that climate variability had no consistent stabilizing effect on coexistence. This case study provides an important reminder that species-specific responses to the environment are not sufficient for coexistence via the storage effect. Instead, the magnitude of temporal variability in species performance also plays an important role. Comparison of our results with those from a similar study in Kansas mixed prairie suggests that temporal variability in species performance may reflect both the strength of environmental variability as well as life history strategies.",2009,NA,Journal article,climate change; grasslands; plant communities; plant competition; prairies; steppes; temporal variation,cabdirect,Yes,,,,,,

Location: Data are from 10,653 georeferenced sites in Washington State, USA, along a longitudinal gradient from west of the crest of the Cascade Range to the beginnings of the western slope of the Rocky Mountains, and across two physiographic provinces, the Northern Cascades, characterized by steep, rugged topography, and the Okanogan Highlands, presenting moderate slopes and broad rounded summits. Methods: Tree data were drawn from the USDA Forest Service Area Ecology Program database, collected in mature, undisturbed stands. We compared simple climatic variables (annual temperature, growing-degree days, annual and seasonal precipitation) to biophysical variables (soil, hydrologic, and solar radiation) derived from climatic variables. Climatic and biophysical variables were taken from the output of climatological and hydrological simulation models and estimated for each plot in the tree database. Generalized linear models were used, for each of fourteen tree species, at multiple spatial extents, to estimate the probability of occurrence of that species as a function of climatic and biophysical predictors. Models were validated by a combination of bootstrapping and estimating receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Results: For the majority of species, we were able to fit variables representing both moisture and temperature gradients, and in all but a few cases these models identified a unimodal response of species occurrence to these gradients. In some cases the ecological/environmental niche of a species had been clearly captured by the model, whereas in others a longer gradient in the predictor variable(s) would be needed. Responses of most species were consistent across three spatial scales. Main conclusions: By identifying the ecological niches of multiple species, we can forecast their redistribution on the landscape in response to climatic change, evaluate the predictions of simulation models, and alert managers to particularly sensitive or vulnerable ecosystems and landscapes.",2003,NA,Journal article,climate change; ecosystems; forests; heat sums; hydrology; landscape; linear models; mountain areas; mountain forests; precipitation; simulation models; soil properties; solar radiation; spatial distribution; temperature,cabdirect,Yes,,,,,,

In this study, groundwater level data from U.S. Geological Survey Ground-Water Climate Response Network wells were used to analyze the relationship between selected drought indices and groundwater level fluctuation. The drought episodes included in this study were selected using climate division level drought indices. Indices included the Palmer Drought Severity Index, Palmer Hydrological Drought Index, and Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI-6, 9, 12, 24). Precipitation and the average temperature were also used. SPI-24 was found to correlate best with groundwater levels during drought. For 17 out of 32 wells, SPI-24 showed the best correlation amongst all of the indices. For 12 out of 32 wells, SPI-24 showed correlation coefficients of -0.6 or stronger; and for other wells, reasonably good correlation was demonstrated. The statistical significance of SPI-24 in predicting groundwater level was also tested. The correlation of average monthly groundwater levels with SPI-24 does not change much throughout the timeframe, for all of the studied wells. The duration of drought also had a significant correlation with the decline of groundwater levels.

The input variables for these models consist of lagged ENSO-data (represented by the Southern Oscillation Index, SOI) and 500 hPa height data clustered into macrocirculation patterns over the western United States, while the output is an estimate of monthly local precipitation at selected Arizona stations. To overcome the lack of SOI data under climate change, several scenarios are constructed by perturbing the historical SOI data in a design of experiments framework.

In this study, the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS, version 6.0) was used, involving a number of predefined LULC scenarios to address the important question regarding dams and their impoundments: How sensitive are the hydroclimatology and terrain features of a region in modulating the postdam response of climate feedbacks to EP? The study region covered the Owyhee Dam/Reservoir on the Owyhee River watershed (ORW), located in eastern Oregon. A systematic perturbation of the relative humidity in the initial and boundary condition of the model was carried out to simulate EP. Among the different LULC scenarios used in the simulation over the ORW, irrigation expansion in the postdam era resulted in an increase in EP up to 6% in the 72-h precipitation total. The contribution of the reservoir on EP added 8% to the 72-h total when compared to the predam LULC conditions. To address the science question, a previously completed investigation on the Folsom Dam [American River watershed (ARW)] in California was compared with the ORW findings on the basis of contrasting differences in hydroclimatology and terrain features. The results indicate that the postdam LULC change scenarios impact EP of ORW (Owyhee Dam) much greater than the EP of the ARW (Folsom Dam) because of its semiarid climate and flat terrain. EP was less sensitive to LULC changes on the windward side of the mountainous terrain of ARW as compared to the leeward side of the flat terrain of ORW.",2014,NA,Scholarly Journals,NA,proquest,Yes,,,,,,

To analyze the human perturbation on water resources consistently over large scales, a number of macro-scale hydrological models (MHMs) have been developed in recent decades. However, few models consider the interaction between terrestrial water fluxes, and human activities and associated water use, and even fewer models distinguish water use from surface water and groundwater resources. Here, we couple a global water demand model with a global hydrological model and dynamically simulate daily water withdrawal and consumptive water use over the period 1979-2010, using two re-analysis products: ERA-Interim and MERRA. We explicitly take into account the mutual feedback between supply and demand, and implement a newly developed water allocation scheme to distinguish surface water and groundwater use. Moreover, we include a new irrigation scheme, which works dynamically with a daily surface and soil water balance, and incorporate the newly available extensive Global Reservoir and Dams data set (GRanD). Simulated surface water and groundwater withdrawals generally show good agreement with reported national and subnational statistics. The results show a consistent increase in both surface water and groundwater use worldwide, with a more rapid increase in groundwater use since the 1990s. Human impacts on terrestrial water storage (TWS) signals are evident, altering the seasonal and interannual variability. This alteration is particularly large over heavily regulated basins such as the Colorado and the Columbia, and over the major irrigated basins such as the Mississippi, the Indus, and the Ganges. Including human water use and associated reservoir operations generally improves the correlation of simulated TWS anomalies with those of the GRACE observations.",2014,NA,Scholarly Journals,NA,proquest,Yes,,,,,,

Since the late 1800s, however, glaciers have thinned and retreated, mainly because of atmospheric warming. Glacier retreat in western Canada and other regions is exposing subfossil tree stumps, soils and plant detritus that, until recently, were beneath tens to hundreds of metres of ice. In addition, human artefacts and caribou dung are emerging from permanent snow patches many thousands of years after they were entombed. Dating of these materials indicates that many of these glaciers and snow patches are smaller today than at any time in the past several thousand years. This evidence, in turn, suggests that glacier recession in the 20th century is unprecedented during the past several millennia and that glaciers in western Canada have reached minimum extents only 150-300years after they achieved their maximum Holocene extents.

Despite this, there is a paucity of long MXD chronologies in the Northern Hemisphere, which limits large-scale tree-ring-based reconstructions of past temperature which are dominated by ring-width (RW) data - a weaker temperature proxy at inter-annual time-scales. This paucity likely results from the relative expense of measuring MXD and the lack of laboratories with the facilities to measure it. Herein, we test the ability of a relatively new, less expensive, tree-ring parameter, Blue Intensity (BI), to act as a surrogate parameter for MXD. BI was measured on Engelmann spruce samples from British Columbia where MXD had previously been measured to allow direct comparison between the two parameters. Signal strength analyses indicate that 8 MXD series were needed to acquire a robust mean chronology while BI needed 14. Utilising different detrending methods and parameter choices (RW+MXD vs RW+BI), a suite of reconstruction variants was developed. The explained variance from the regression modelling (1901-1995) of May-August maximum temperatures ranged from 52% to 55%. Validation tests over the earlier 1870-1900 period could not statistically distinguish between the different variants, although spectral analysis identified more lower frequency information extant in the MXD-based reconstructions - although this result was sensitive to the detrending method used. Ultimately, despite the MXD-based reconstruction explaining slightly more of the climatic variance, statistically robust reconstructions of past summer temperatures were also derived using BI. These results suggest that there is great potential in utilising BI for dendroclimatology in place of MXD data. However, more experimentation is needed to understand (1) how well BI can capture centennial and lower frequency information and (2) what biases may result from wood discolouration, either from species showing a distinct heartwood/sapwood boundary or from partly decayed sub-fossil samples.

However, the diversity of drought indices raises several issues: 1) which indices perform best and where; 2) does the incorporation of potential evapotranspiration (PET) in indices strengthen relationships, and how sensitive is the choice of PET methods to such results; 3) what additional value is added by using higher-spatial-resolution gridded climate layers; and 4) how have observed relationships changed through time. Standardized precipitation index, standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI), Palmer drought severity index, and water balance runoff (WBR) model output were correlated to water-year runoff for 21 unregulated drainage basins in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. SPEI and WBR with time scales encompassing the primary precipitation season maximized the explained variance in water-year runoff in most basins. Slightly stronger correlations were found using PET estimates from the Penman-Monteith method over the Thornthwaite method, particularly for time periods that incorporated the spring and summer months in basins that receive appreciable precipitation during the growing season. Indices computed using high-resolution climate surfaces explained over 10% more variability than metrics derived from coarser-resolution datasets. Increased correlation in the latter half of the study period was partially attributable to increased streamflow variability in recent decades as well as to improved climate data quality across the interior mountain watersheds.",2014,NA,Scholarly Journals,NA,proquest,Yes,,,,,,

The conceptual model is calibrated to a variety of existing observations, taken in watershed 10 (WS10) at the HJ Andrews Experimental Forest (HJA) in Oregon, USA, a long term ecological research (LTER) site with a long history of catchment-scale data collection. The modeling framework was designed to help document and evaluate an evolving understanding of catchment processing of water, nitrogen, and carbon that has developed over the many years of on-going research at the site. We use the dynamic model to capture the temporal variation in the N and C budgets and to evaluate how different components of the complex system may control the retention and release of N in this pristine forested landscape. Results indicate that the relative roles of multiple competing controls on N change seasonally, between periods of wet/dry and growth/senescence. The model represents a communication strategy to facilitate dialog between disciplinary experimentalists and modelers, to produce a more complete picture of nitrogen cycling in the region. We view this explicit development of complete, yet conceptually simplified models as a useful and important way to evaluate complex environmental dynamics.",2015,NA,Scholarly Journals,NA,proquest,Yes,,,,,,

Snow cover maps during spring snowmelt for 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2005, 2007, and 2009 were compared between MODIS Terra and Landsat TM/ETM+using least-squared regression. Strong spatial and temporal map agreement was found between MODIS Terra fractional snow cover and Landsat TM/ETM+snow-covered area, although map disagreement was observed for two validation dates. High-altitude cirrus cloud contamination during low snow conditions as well as late season transient snowfall resulted in map disagreement. MODIS Terra's spatial resolution limits retrieval of thin-patchy snow cover, especially during partially cloudy conditions. Landsat's image acquisition frequency can introduce difficulty when discriminating between transient and resident mountain snow cover. Furthermore, transient snowfall later in the snowmelt season, which is a stochastic accumulation event that does not usually persist beyond the daily timescale, will skew decadal snow-covered area variability if bi-monthly climate data record development is the objective. As a quality control step, ground-based daily snow telemetry snow-water-equivalent measurements can be used to verify transient snowfall events. Users of daily MODIS Terra fractional snow products should be aware that local solar illumination and sensor viewing geometry might influence fractional snow cover estimation in mountainous terrain. Cross-sensor interoperability has been confirmed between MODIS Terra and Landsat TM/ETM+when mapping snow from the visible/infrared spectrum. This relationship is strong and supports operational multi-sensor snow cover mapping, specifically climate data record development to expand cryosphere, climate, and hydrological science applications.

Averaged across the western United States, SWE generally was higher than long-term (1900-2008) average conditions during the periods 1900-25, 1944-55, and 1966-82; SWE was lower than long-term average conditions during the periods 1926-43, 1957-65, and 1984-2008. During the period 1900-2008, the temporal pattern in winter precipitation exhibited wetter-than-average and drier-than-average decadal-scale periods with no long-term increasing or decreasing trend. Winter temperature generally was below average from 1900 to the mid-1950s, close to average from the mid-1950s to the mid-1980s, and above average from the mid-1980s to 2008. In general, periods of higher-than-average SWE have been associated with higher precipitation and lower temperature. Since about 1980, western U.S. winter temperatures have been consistently higher than long-term average values, and the resultant lower-than-average SWE values have been only partially offset by periods of higher-than-average precipitation. The post-1980 lower-than-average SWE conditions in the western United States are unprecedented within the context of twentieth-century climate and estimated SWE.",2009,NA,Scholarly Journals,NA,proquest,Yes,,,,,,

Animated map sequences of temperature and precipitation, their average, intermonthly changes, and the local timing of annual maxima or minima provide a comprehensive spatiotemporal baseline of regional climate. The animated maps illustrate three scales of variation: 1) broadscale patterns related to the annual cycle of insolation and hemispheric-scale atmospheric circulation features; 2) mesoscale patterns related to location on the continent and the influence of specific regional circulation features like those associated with the North American monsoon; and 3) smaller-scale spatial variations, related to the mediation by local physiography of the influence of large-scale circulation. Although most western U.S. stations have temperature maxima in July, a delay occurs at stations along the West Coast and interior Washington, northern Idaho, and Montana. A seesaw pattern of precipitation maxima is evident between coastal areas (winter dominated) and the interior (summer dominated). Cluster analyses of the ratio of monthly-to-annual precipitation values for each station identify regions with similar annual cycles of precipitation. Regions of high spatial heterogeneity in the timing of when precipitation occurs include the northern Rocky Mountains, Utah, Arizona, and northwestern Montana. The superimposition of these three scales of spatial variability leads to steep gradients and, in some regions, considerable spatial heterogeneity in annual precipitation. The regional patterns of precipitation heterogeneity highlight vulnerability to drought, especially in regions of the interior west that do not have a dominant precipitation month or season.",2010,NA,Scholarly Journals,NA,proquest,Yes,,,,,,

Habitats are often connected by fluxes of energy and nutrients across their boundaries. For example, headwater streams are linked to surrounding riparian vegetation through invertebrate and leaf litter inputs, and there is evidence that consumers in downstream habitats are subsidised by resources flowing from headwater systems. However, the strength of these linkages and the manner in which potential headwater subsidies vary along climatic and disturbance gradients are unknown.2. We quantified the downstream transport of invertebrates, organic matter and inorganic sediment from 60 fishless headwater streams in the Wenatchee River Basin located on the eastern slope of the Cascade Range in Washington, U.S.A. Streams were classified into four groups (each n = 15) based on their position within two ecological subregions (wet and dry) and the extent of past timber harvest and road development (logged and unlogged).3. Time and ecoregion were significant for all response variables as transport varied across sampling periods, and dry ecoregion streams displayed significantly higher mean values. Logged sites also generally showed higher mean transport, but only inorganic sediment transport was significantly higher in logged sites. Both ecoregion and land-use interacted significantly with time depending on the response variable. Differences among stream categories were driven by relatively low levels of transport in unlogged drainages of the wet ecoregion. Interestingly, unlogged dry ecoregion streams showed comparable transport rates to logged sites in the wet ecoregion. Dominance by deciduous riparian vegetation in all but unlogged streams in the wet ecoregion is a primary hypothesised mechanism determining transport dynamics in our study streams.4. Understanding the quantity and variation of headwater subsidies across climate and disturbance gradients is needed to appreciate the significance of ecological linkages between headwaters and associated downstream habitats. This will enable the accurate assessment of resource management impacts on stream ecosystems. Predicting the consequences of natural and anthropogenic disturbances on headwater stream transport rates will require knowledge of how both local and regional factors influence these potential subsidies. Our results suggest that resources transported from headwater streams reflect both the meso-scale land-use surrounding these areas and the constraints imposed by the ecoregion in which they are embedded.",2010,"aquatic invertebrate , ecoregion , headwater stream , logging , subsidy",Scholarly Journals,"aquatic invertebrate , ecoregion , headwater stream , logging , subsidy",proquest,Yes,,,,,,

Evaluation of spatial and temporal variations of individual erosion processes can augment our understanding of factors controlling relief and geomorphic development of alpine settings. This study tests the application of detrital apatite (U-Th)/He thermochronology (AHe) to evaluate variable erosion in small, geologically complex catchments. Detrital grains from glacial and fluvial sediment in a single basin were dated and compared with a bedrock derived age-elevation relationship to estimate spatial variation in erosion over different climate conditions in the Teton Range, Wyoming. Controls and pitfalls related to apatite quality and yield were fully evaluated to assess this technique. Probability density functions comparing detrital age distributions identify variations in erosional patterns between glacial and fluvial systems and provide insight into how glacial, fluvial, and hillslope processes interact. Similar age distributions representing erosion patterns during glacial and interglacial times suggest the basin may be approaching steady-state. This also implies that glaciers are limited and no longer act as buzzsaws or produce relief. However, subtle differences in erosional efficiency do exist. The high frequency of apatite cooling ages from high altitudes represents either rapid denudation of peaks and ridges by mass wasting or an artifact of sample quality. A gap in detrital ages near the mean age, or mid-altitude, indicates the fluvial system is presently transport limited by overwhelming talus deposits. This study confirms that sediment sources can be traced in small basins with detrital AHe dating. It also demonstrates that careful consideration of mineral yield and quality is required, and uniform erosion assumptions needed to extract basin thermal history from detrital ages are not always valid.",2011,NA,Scholarly Journals,NA,proquest,Yes,,,,,,

Simulated daily streamflow and energy output from the watershed models were used to compute a range of statistics. With a side-by-side comparison of the statistical analyses for the 14 basins, regional climatic and hydrologic trends over the twenty-first century could be qualitatively identified. Low-flow statistics (95% exceedance, 7-day mean annual minimum, and summer mean monthly streamflow) decreased for almost all basins. Annual maximum daily streamflow also decreased in all the basins, except for all four basins in California and the Pacific Northwest. An analysis of the supply of available energy and water for the basins indicated that ratios of evaporation to precipitation and potential evapotranspiration to precipitation for most of the basins will increase. Probability density functions (PDFs) were developed to assess the uncertainty and multimodality in the impact of climate change on mean annual streamflow variability. Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests showed significant differences between the beginning and ending twenty-first-century PDFs for most of the basins, with the exception of four basins that are located in the western United States. Almost none of the basin PDFs were normally distributed, and two basins in the upper Midwest had PDFs that were extremely dispersed and skewed.

Such climatological information is potentially useful for several hydrologic applications, including estimation of real-time SWE grids and calibration and evaluation of SWE estimates obtained from remote sensing or through various snow models. Regional delineation for the mountainous regions of the western United States was done through cluster analysis in consideration of the characteristics of seasonal snow pack accumulation and ablation processes. Various geographic and meteorological parameters were further investigated through stepwise regression as potential predictors of monthly changes in climatological SWE in each delineated region. In-situ measurements of SWE, obtained from the Natural Resources Conservation Service's Snow Telemetry network for the period from 1980 to 2004, were used to calibrate regional equations. The spatial and temporal resolution of the analysis was based on the resolution of available meteorological data - 4km and 1month, respectively. For a monthly time step, the reliability of the SWE estimates did not significantly increase when the number of regions was more than five. The performance of the developed regional equations was evaluated via a jack-knife technique. The regional equations developed using monthly resolution and large regions provided reliable estimates for the majority of regions from October to March, but not in April, especially in the North Pacific and Southwest regions. Sub-regionalization, a finer time step for the analysis and/or inclusion of additional SWE predictor variables may increase the reliability of SWE climatological estimates for warmer months.",2011,NA,Scholarly Journals,NA,proquest,Yes,,,,,,

These recent outbreaks are thought to have been favoured by large-scale climatic shifts, and may foreshadow outbreaks of a similar magnitude in North American forests over the coming decades. The associated forest dieback could result in substantial shifts in evapotranspiration and albedo, thereby altering the local surface energy balance, and in turn regional temperature and climate. Here we quantify the impact of the Canadian pine beetle disturbance on the local summertime surface energy budget, using measurements of evapotranspiration, albedo and surface temperature, obtained primarily through remote sensing. We show that over the 170,000km super(2) of affected forest, the typical decrease in summertime evapotranspiration is 19%. Changes to the absorbed short-wave flux are negligible, in comparison. As a result, outgoing sensible and radiative heat fluxes increased by 8% and 1%, respectively, corresponding to a typical increase in surface temperature of 1 degree C. These changes are comparable to those observed for other types of disturbance, such as wildfire, and may have secondary consequences for climate, including modifications to circulation, cloud cover and precipitation.",2013,NA,Scholarly Journals,NA,proquest,Yes,,,,,,

Such changes are controlled, at least partially, by variations in snowpack. The CCE consists primarily of public lands, the majority of which is undeveloped or wilderness. Consequently, this region is well suited for an examination of long-term snowpack variation and associated ecosystem change. Data from nine SNOTEL sites provide an indication of the daily accumulation and ablation of snowpack over the period 1977-2001, as well as the relationship between precipitation, temperature and snowpack. 1 April data from 21 snow courses indicated the extent of regional snowpack variation and trends over the period 1950-2001, and 1 May data from three snow courses in Glacier National Park allow this record to be extended back to 1922. SNOTEL data suggest CCE snowpacks are larger and more persistent than in most regions of the western USA, and that water year precipitation is the primary control on 1 April snow water equivalent (SWE). Snow course data indicate that variations in both 1 April and 1 May mean SWE are closely tied to the Pacific decadal oscillation, an El Ni������o-southern oscillation-like interdecadal pattern of Pacific Ocean climate variability.

We used an elevational climate and tree species composition gradient in Rocky Mountain subalpine forest to quantify the sensitivity of all major ecosystem carbon stocks and fluxes to these factors.

Application of the proposed index to two basins indicates that the single parameter precipitation elasticity index may give a general relationship between precipitation and streamflow in some cases, but that it cannot reflect the complicated non-linear relationship among streamflow, precipitation and temperature. For example, for the Spokane River basin the climate elasticity of streamflow index varies from 2.4 to 0.2, for a precipitation increase of 20%, as temperature varies from 1������C lower to 1.8������C higher than the long term mean. Thus a 20% precipitation increase may result in a streamflow increase of 48% if the temperature is 1������C lower but only a 4% increase if the temperature is 1.8������C higher than the long-term mean. The proposed method can be applied to other basins to assess potential climate change effects on annual streamflow.

The linkage between these monthly indices and daily precipitation was investigated by perturbing logits of Markov chain transition probabilities and the mean of the mixed exponential distribution by linear functions of a time-lagged SOI and concurrent PDO. The combination of linear coefficients and lags that resulted in the maximum log-likelihood functions was identified, and the Akaike information criterion (AIC) was used to determine the best model. The SOI effect was consistent with previous studies in that negative SOI (El Ni������o) leads to more frequent precipitation and greater amounts of precipitation given a wet day in Nevada and the Southwest, with the opposite effect in the northwest. SOI and PDO interactions were most significant for the Nevada stations where a positive PDO increases both the probability of a wet day for three transition probabilities and also increases the mean of wet-day precipitation. The PDO had little effect for the monsoonal (Arizona and New Mexico) stations except for Hobbs, New Mexico, where a positive PDO would increase the mean depth on a wet day. The Washington stations showed an increase in the frequency and mean depth of precipitation given a positive SOI, but PDO had little effect. Identification of combined SOI-PDO effects allows more realistic simulations of daily precipitation and provides insight into the reliability of short records.",2008,NA,Journal article,climate change; precipitation; stochastic models,cabdirect,Yes,,,,,,

As a result, the forest consists of up to 494 species of vascular plants at any one site compared to 871 species at Mount Rainier, Washington State. For comparison, 2,993 taxa have been reported from British Columbia indicating the limited colonization that has occurred. European Man has added to these problems by increasing fire frequency and by extensive, repeated logging of large areas.

Changing climate creates risk as new terrain becomes climatically suitable for invasion. However, climate change may also create opportunities for ecosystem restoration on invaded lands that become climatically unsuitable for invasive species. Here, I develop a bioclimatic envelope model for cheatgrass (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Bromus tectorum</i>), a non-native invasive grass in the western US, based on its invaded distribution. The bioclimatic envelope model is based on the Mahalanobis distance using the climate variables that best constrain the species' distribution. Of the precipitation and temperature variables measured, the best predictors of cheatgrass are summer, annual, and spring precipitation, followed by winter temperature. I perform a sensitivity analysis on potential cheatgrass distributions using the projections of 10 commonly used atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs) for 2100. The AOGCM projections for precipitation vary considerably, increasing uncertainty in the assessment of invasion risk. Decreased precipitation, particularly in the summer, causes an expansion of suitable land area by up to 45%, elevating invasion risk in parts of Montana, Wyoming, Utah, and Colorado. Conversely, increased precipitation reduces habitat by as much as 70%, decreasing invasion risk. The strong influence of precipitation conditions on this species' distribution suggests that relying on temperature change alone to project future change in plant distributions may be inadequate. A sensitivity analysis provides a framework for identifying key climate variables that may limit invasion, and for assessing invasion risk and restoration opportunities with climate change.",2009,NA,Journal article,climate; climate change; ecosystems; effects; interactions; invasive species; models,cabdirect,Yes,,,,,,

However, although many species' ranges have shifted in historical times, many others have not, or have shifted only at the high-latitude or high-elevation limits, leading to range expansions rather than contractions. Given these idiosyncratic responses to climate warming, and their varied implications for species' vulnerability to climate change, a critical task is to understand why some species have not shifted their ranges, particularly at the equatorial or low-elevation limits, and whether such resilience will last as warming continues. Here we show that compensatory changes in demographic rates are buffering southern populations of two North American tundra plants against the negative effects of a warming climate, slowing their northward range shifts, but that this buffering is unlikely to continue indefinitely. Southern populations of both species showed lower survival and recruitment but higher growth of individual plants, possibly owing to longer, warmer growing seasons. Because of these and other compensatory changes, the population growth rates of southern populations are not at present lower than those of northern ones. However, continued warming may yet prove detrimental, as most demographic rates that improved in moderately warmer years declined in the warmest years, with the potential to drive future population declines. Our results emphasize the need for long-term, range-wide measurement of all population processes to detect demographic compensation and to identify nonlinear responses that may lead to sudden range shifts as climatic tipping points are exceeded.",2010,NA,Journal article,climate change; demography; geographical distribution; global warming; growth; life history; natural regeneration; population dynamics; recruitment; survival; tundra,cabdirect,Yes,,,,,,

Recent, large-scale outbreaks of mountain pine beetle have raised concerns for the viability of some white pine populations.

Basins were categorized by the percentage of snowmelt-derived runoff to enable the comparison of groups of streams with similar runoff characteristics and to quantify shifts in snowmelt-dominated regimes. Results indicate that streamflow has continued to shift to earlier in the water year, most notably for those basins with the largest snowmelt runoff component. However, an acceleration of these streamflow timing changes for the recent warm decades is not clearly indicated. Most coastal rain-dominated and some interior basins have experienced later timing. The timing changes are connected to area-wide warmer temperatures, especially in March and January, and to precipitation shifts that bear subregional signatures.

Model results generally indicate increased precipitation, but spring runoff volumes will decrease substantially, because the higher rain:snow ratio and shorter accumulation period will decrease snowpack volume. Overall, the results of this study indicate that the increased winter temperature resulting from anthropogenically-induced climate change, will result in shorter winters, reduced snowpack volume, and earlier spring snowmelt and runoff onset, resulting in substantial reductions in spring discharge.",2011,NA,Journal article,climate change; discharge; environmental impact; microclimate; mountain areas; precipitation; rain; runoff; simulation models; snow; spring; stream flow; temperature; watersheds,cabdirect,Yes,,,,,,

E.","Periglacial debris-flow initiation and susceptibility and glacier recession from imagery, airborne liDAR, and ground-based mapping.",Geosphere,"Climate changes in the Pacific Northwest, USA, may cause both retreat of alpine glaciers and increases in the frequency and magnitude of storms delivering rainfall at high elevations absent significant snowpack, and both of these changes may affect the frequency and severity of destructive debris flows initiating on the region's composite volcanoes. A better understanding of debris-flow susceptibility on these volcanoes' slopes is therefore warranted. Field mapping and remote sensing data, including airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR), were used to locate and characterize initiation sites of six debris flows that occurred during an ""atmospheric river"" event (warm wet storm) on Mount Rainier, Washington, in November 2006, and data from prior studies identified six more debris flows that occurred in 2001-2005. These 12 debris flows had initiation sources at the heads of 17 gullies distributed over seven distinct initiation zones near the termini of glaciers, and all debris-flow initiation sites were located within areas exposed by glacier retreat in the past century. Gully locations were identified by their steep walls and heads on a 1-m digital elevation model (DEM) from LiDAR data collected in 2007-2008. Gullies in which debris flows initiated were differentiated from numerous non-initiating gullies primarily by the greater upslope contributing areas of the former. Initiation mechanisms were inferred from pre- and post-2006 gully width measurements from aerial photos and the LiDAR DEM, respectively, field observations of gully banks, and elevation changes calculated from repeated LiDAR, and these data indicate that debris flows were initiated by distributed sources, including bank mass failures, related to erosion by overland flow of water. Using gully-head initiation sites for debris flows that occurred during 2001-2006, a data model was developed to explore the viability of the method for characterization of debris-flow initiation susceptibilities on Mount Rainier. The initiation sites were found to occupy a restricted part of the four-dimensional space defined by mean and standard deviation of simulated glacial meltwater flow, slope angle, and minimum distance to an area of recent (1994-2008) glacier retreat. The model identifies the heads of most gullies, including all sites of known debris-flow initiation, as high-susceptibility areas, but does not appear to differentiate between areas of varying gully-head density or between debris-flow and no-debris-flow gullies. The model and field data, despite limitations, do provide insight into debris-flow processes, as well as feasible methods for mapping and assessment of debris-flow susceptibilities on periglacial areas of the Cascade Range.",2012,NA,Journal article,climate change; glaciers; lidar; mapping; meltwater; overland flow; remote sensing; satellite imagery; susceptibility; water flow,cabdirect,Yes,,,,,,

To address these concerns, the objective of this study was to evaluate streamflow changes/sensitivity when temperatures increase. A hydrological model, the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model, was applied to simulate streamflow under thirty temperature increase scenarios (i.e., rising 0.1������C per step to 3������C). It was found that the annual mean streamflow decreased whenever temperatures increased in the SRB. Streamflow increases in winter and decreases in spring and summer but is barely affected by temperature in autumn. On a monthly basis, streamflow responses varied in response to rising temperatures. When temperature increased, the streamflow increase occurred from November to February, and it decreased from May to July. The analysis also discovered linear relationships between rising temperatures and streamflow changes throughout the year, with the exception of June and July, which revealed logarithmic correlations. Results obtained by daily streamflow analysis showed that center time occurred 10-30 d earlier when temperatures increased 2������C and 15-45 d earlier when temperatures increased 3������C. Finally, the Richards-Barker Index (R-B Index), a flashiness index, also increased with rising temperatures, and a higher R-B Index causes bank erosion problems.

The tests are conducted at six stations from the coastal, mountainous, and taiga region of British Columbia, Canada, whose climatic extremes are measured using the 27 Climate Indices of Extremes (ClimDEX; http://www.climdex.org/climdex/index.action) indices. All methods are calibrated from data prior to 1991, and tested against the two decades from 1991 to 2010. A three-step testing procedure is used to establish a given method as reliable for any given index. The first step analyzes the sensitivity of a method to actual index anomalies by correlating observed and NCEP-downscaled annual index values; then, whether the <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">distribution</i> of an index corresponds to observations is tested. Finally, this latter test is applied to a downscaled climate simulation. This gives a total of 486 single and 162 combined tests. The temperature-related indices pass about twice as many tests as the precipitation indices, and temporally more complex indices that involve consecutive days pass none of the combined tests. With respect to regions, there is some tendency of better performance at the coastal and mountaintop stations. With respect to methods, XDS performed best, on average, with 19% (48%) of passed combined (single) tests, followed by BCSD and QRNN with 10% (45%) and 10% (31%), respectively, ASD with 6% (23%), and TG with 4% (21%) of passed tests.

We incorporate climate information at the population level, yielding a model that is specific to both species and population. We use data from provenance tests from previous studies that comprised 236 populations from Idaho, Montana, and eastern Washington, USA. The most sensitive indicator of climate was the mean temperature of the coldest month. Population maximum HT and HT growth response to changes in climate were dependent on seed source climate. All populations had optimum HT growth when transferred to climates with warmer winters; those originating in sites with the warmest winters were taller across sites and had highest HT growth at transfer distances closest to zero; those from colder climates were shortest and had optimum HT growth when transferred the farthest. Although this differential response damped the height growth differences among populations, cold-climate populations still achieved their maximum growth at lower temperatures than warm-climate populations.

When carbon is removed from forests through harvest, a portion of the harvested carbon is stored in wood products, often for many decades. The United States Forest Service (USFS) and other agencies are interested in accurately accounting for carbon flux associated with harvested wood products (HWP) to meet greenhouse gas monitoring commitments and climate change adaptation and mitigation objectives. This paper uses the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) production accounting approach and the California Forest Project Protocol (CFPP) to estimate HWP carbon storage from 1906 to 2010 for the USFS Northern Region, which includes forests in northern Idaho, Montana, South Dakota, and eastern Washington. Results: Based on the IPCC approach, carbon stocks in the HWP pool were increasing at one million megagrams of carbon (MgC) per year in the mid 1960s, with peak cumulative storage of 28 million MgC occurring in 1995. Net positive flux into the HWP pool over this period is primarily attributable to high harvest levels in the mid twentieth century. Harvest levels declined after 1970, resulting in less carbon entering the HWP pool. Since 1995, emissions from HWP at solid waste disposal sites have exceeded additions from harvesting, resulting in a decline in the total amount of carbon stored in the HWP pool. The CFPP approach shows a similar trend, with 100-year average carbon storage for each annual Northern Region harvest peaking in 1969 at 937,900 MgC, and fluctuating between 84,000 and 150,000 MgC over the last decade. Conclusions: The Northern Region HWP pool is now in a period of negative net annual stock change because the decay of products harvested between 1906 and 2010 exceeds additions of carbon to the HWP pool through harvest. However, total forest carbon includes both HWP and ecosystem carbon, which may have increased over the study period. Though our emphasis is on the Northern Region, we provide a framework by which the IPCC and CFPP methods can be applied broadly at sub-national scales to other regions, land management units, or firms.",2012,NA,Journal article,air pollutants; air pollution; air quality; carbon; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; climate change; emission; greenhouse gases; nature reserves; photosynthesis; wood products,cabdirect,Yes,,,,,,

In this study, quantitative evidence based on empirical data is provided to support the key role of extrinsic, climate-induced thresholds in governing the spatial and temporal patterns of tree establishment in these high-elevation environments. Dendroecological techniques were used to reconstruct a 420-year history of regeneration dynamics within upper treeline ecotones along a latitudinal gradient (���������44-35������N) in the Rocky Mountains. Correlation analysis was used to assess the possible influence of minimum and maximum temperature indices and cool-season (November-April) precipitation on regional age-structure data. Regime-shift analysis was used to detect thresholds in tree establishment during the entire period of record (1580-2000), temperature variables significantly correlated with establishment during the 20th century, and cool-season precipitation. Tree establishment was significantly correlated with minimum temperature during the spring (March-May) and cool season. Regime-shift analysis identified an abrupt increase in regional tree establishment in 1950 (1950-1954 age class). Coincident with this period was a shift toward reduced cool-season precipitation. The alignment of these climate conditions apparently triggered an abrupt increase in establishment that was unprecedented during the period of record. Two main findings emerge from this research that underscore the critical role of climate in governing regeneration dynamics within upper treeline ecotones. (1) Regional climate variability is capable of exceeding bioclimatic thresholds, thereby initiating synchronous and abrupt changes in the spatial and temporal patterns of tree establishment at broad regional scales. (2) The importance of climate parameters exceeding critical threshold values and triggering a regime shift in tree establishment appears to be contingent on the alignment of favorable temperature and moisture regimes. This research suggests that threshold changes in the climate system can fundamentally alter regeneration dynamics within upper treeline ecotones and, through the use of regime-shift analysis, reveals important climate-vegetation linkages.",2012,NA,Journal article,age structure; climate; climate change; dendrochronology; ecology; ecosystems; ecotones; effects; growth rings; history; mountains; regeneration; techniques; treelines; trees; woody plants,cabdirect,Yes,,,,,,

The impact of relative humidity and wind speed is examined by comparing KBDI with the modified Fosberg Fire Weather Index (mFFWI). The present (1971-2000) and future (2041-2070) daily regional climate conditions were obtained by dynamical downscaling of the HadCM3 global projection using HRM3 regional climate model provided by the North America Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCP). It is shown that fire potential is expected to increase in the Southwest, Rocky Mountains, northern Great Plains, Southeast, and Pacific coast, mainly caused by future warming trends. Most pronounced increases occur in summer and autumn. Fire seasons will become longer in many regions. The future fire potential increase will be less pronounced in the northern Rocky Mountains due to the changes in humidity and wind. Present fire potential is found to have been increasing across continental U.S. in recent decades. The future KBDI increase in the central Plains and the South projected using the HadCM3-HRM3 climate change scenario is smaller than the increases using the climate change scenarios from most of other NARCCAP model combinations.

With rapid climate change expected in the coming decades, ecologists have predicted that species ranges will shift large distances in elevation and latitude. However, most range shift assessments are based on coarse-scale climate models that ignore fine-scale heterogeneity and could fail to capture important range shift dynamics. Moreover, if climate varies dramatically over short distances, some populations of certain species may only need to migrate tens of meters between microhabitats to track their climate as opposed to hundreds of meters upward or hundreds of kilometers poleward. To address these issues, we measured climate variables that are likely important determinants of plant species distributions and abundances (snow disappearance date and soil temperature) at coarse and fine scales at Mount Rainier National Park in Washington State, USA. Coarse-scale differences across the landscape such as large changes in elevation had expected effects on climatic variables, with later snow disappearance dates and lower temperatures at higher elevations. However, locations separated by small distances (���������20 m), but differing by vegetation structure or topographic position, often experienced differences in snow disappearance date and soil temperature as great as locations separated by large distances (&gt;1 km). Tree canopy gaps and topographic depressions experienced later snow disappearance dates than corresponding locations under intact canopy and on ridges. Additionally, locations under vegetation and on topographic ridges experienced lower maximum and higher minimum soil temperatures.

Analyses of changes in climate, physical, and lower trophic level biological factors provide substantial evidence that climate conditions directly and indirectly influence the abundance and productivity of North American Atlantic salmon populations. A major decline in salmon abundance after 1990 was preceded by a series of changes across multiple levels of the ecosystem, and a subsequent population change in 1997, primarily related to salmon productivity, followed an unusually low NAO event. Pairwise correlations further demonstrate that climate and physical conditions are associated with changes in plankton communities and prey availability, which are ultimately linked to Atlantic salmon populations.

Because sedges typically have weak interactions with mycorrhizal fungi relative to grasses, lowered abundances of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi or other root-inhabiting fungi could underlie warming-induced shifts in plant species composition.

A.",Validation and sensitivity test of the distributed hydrology soil-vegetation model (DHSVM) in a forested mountain watershed.,Hydrological Processes,"Hydrologic models are often calibrated and validated with streamflow from a limited number of sites, whereas assessment of model performance with internal watershed data can be used to constrain the parameterization of physically based models to verify that specific hydrologic processes are being reasonably simulated. This is particularly important for improving the simulation accuracy of models used to evaluate potential hydrologic responses to land use and climate change. The distributed hydrology soil-vegetation model (DHSVM) was parameterized for the Mica Creek Experimental Watershed in northern Idaho. Performance was assessed based on measured streamflow from nested and paired watersheds, snowpack dynamics, soil moisture, and transpiration estimated from sap flux. In general, DHSVM effectively simulated snowpack dynamics, soil water content, and the streamflow regime. Streamflow simulation for seven subcatchments had model efficiencies ranging between 0.63 and 0.79. Model efficiency of snowpack simulation at a SNOTEL site was 0.95. Some minor discrepancies between simulated and measured values suggested that some processes, such as snow redistribution, were not represented by the model or were insufficiently parameterized for local conditions. A sensitivity analysis indicated that soil porosity, leaf area index, and minimum stomatal resistance were among the most influential parameters that affected variations in the simulated hydrological regime.

Although the fire seasonality is commonly determined using burned area and fire frequency, it could also be quantified using biomass consumption estimates that directly represent biomass loss (a combination of the area burned and the fuel loading). Therefore, in this study a data set of long-term biomass consumed was derived from geostationary satellite data to explore the interannual variation in the fire seasonality and the possible impacts of climate change and land management practices across the Contiguous United States (CONUS). Specifically, daily biomass consumed data were derived using the fire radiative power retrieved from Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites series with a pixel size of 4-10 km from 1995 to 2011. Annual fire seasonality metrics including the fire season duration, the timing of the start, peak, and end of the fire season, and interannual variation and trends were derived from the 17 year biomass consumed record. These metrics were associated with climatic factors to examine drivers and mediators of fire seasonality. The results indicate that biomass consumed significantly increased at a rate of 2.87 Tg/yr; however, the derived fire season duration exhibited a shortening trend in various states over the western CONUS and no significant trend in most other regions. This suggests that the frequency of extreme fire events has increased, which is perhaps associated with an observed increase of extreme weather conditions. Further, both the start and the end of the fire season exhibited an early shift (1.5-5 d/yr) in various eastern states although a late shift occurred in Arizona and Oregon. The interannual variation and trend in the fire seasonality was more strongly related to temperature in the western CONUS and to precipitation in the southeast. The Palmer Drought Severity Index was found to effectively reflect interannual variations in total biomass consumed although it was poorly correlated to the fire seasonality metrics. The results indicate that across the CONUS, the spatial patterns of the start, peak, and end of the fire season shift regularly in various regions in response to latitudinal gradients of temperature variation.",2014,NA,Journal article,biomass; climate change; climatic factors; forest fires; land management; precipitation; remote sensing; seasonality; temperature; trends; weather; wildfires,cabdirect,Yes,,,,,,

We assess the model for predicting climate-related variation in stream temperature by comparing observed and predicted historical stream temperature changes. Analysis of covariance confirms that observed and predicted changes in stream temperatures respond similarly to historical changes in air temperature. When applied to spatially-downscaled future air temperature projections (A2 emission scenario), the model predicts mean warming of 2.2������C for the conterminous USA by 2100. Stream temperatures are most responsive to climate changes in the Cascade and Appalachian Mountains and least responsive in the southeastern USA. We then use random forests to conduct an empirical sensitivity analysis to identify those stream features most strongly associated with both observed historical and predicted future changes in summer stream temperatures. Larger changes in stream temperature are associated with warmer future air temperatures, greater air temperature changes, and larger watershed areas. Smaller changes in stream temperature are predicted for streams with high initial rates of heat loss associated with longwave radiation and evaporation, and greater base-flow index values.

With spatial resolution often in the tens of kilometers, however, even RCM output will likely fail to resolve local topography that may be climatically significant in high-relief basins. Here we develop and apply an approach for downscaling RCM output using local topographic lapse rates (empirically-estimated spatially and seasonally variable changes in climate variables with elevation). We calculate monthly local topographic lapse rates from the 800-m Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) dataset, which is based on regressions of observed climate against topographic variables. We then use these lapse rates to elevationally correct two sources of regional climate-model output: (1) the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR), a retrospective dataset produced from a regional forecasting model constrained by observations, and (2) a range of baseline climate scenarios from the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP), which is produced by a series of RCMs driven by GCMs. By running a calibrated and validated hydrologic model, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), using observed station data and elevationally-adjusted NARR and NARCCAP output, we are able to estimate the sensitivity of hydrologic modeling to the source of the input climate data.

Stream temperature is an important indicator of stream ecosystem health and is affected by catchment-scale climate and hydrological processes, morphology, and riparian vegetation. To properly manage affected systems and achieve ecosystem sustainability, it is important to understand the relative impact of these factors. In this study, we predict relative impacts of different stressors using an integrated catchment-scale ecohydrological model that simulates hydrological processes, stream temperature, and fish growth. This type of model offers a suitable measure of ecosystem services because it provides information about the reproductive capability of fish under different conditions. We applied the model to Silver Creek, Idaho, a stream highly valued for its world-renowned trout fishery. The simulations indicated that intensive water use by agriculture and climate change are both major contributors to habitat degradation in the study area. Agricultural practices that increase water use efficiency and mitigate drainage runoff are feasible and can have positive impacts on the ecosystem. All of the mitigation strategies simulated reduced stream temperatures to varying degrees; however, not all resulted in increases in fish growth.

However less is known about how information functions as a barrier, and to what degree it prevents adaptation compared to other perceived barriers. In addition, the role of institutional context in mediating the demand for information in the context of adaptation has been less well studied. This paper helps to clarify the role that information plays in adaptation planning for two sectors of public employees working at similar scales, in similar locations, with similar challenges. We conducted surveys and semi-structured interviews to investigate the demand for information in support of adaptation implementation and planning from US federal public lands managers and municipal officials in the US interior West. We found that federal managers and municipal officials both consulted information frequently for decision making, and while both groups indicated that lack of information at relevant scales was a barrier to adaptation planning, this was seen as a much stronger barrier for federal managers than for communities. Uncertainty of information was raised as an issue, but results were mixed on whether or not this acted as a strong barrier. While peer-reviewed publications were seen as the ""best available science,"" and correlated with adaptation planning, they were not accessed directly as frequently as other sources of information, including colleagues, the internet and reports.

We conducted a two-year field experiment to test the effect of warming, competition, and seed source on cheatgrass performance across an elevation gradient in northern Utah. We hypothesized that warming would increase cheatgrass performance, but that warming effects would be limited by competing vegetation and by local adaptation of cheatgrass seed sources. The warming treatment relied on open top chambers, we removed vegetation to assess the effect of competition from neighboring vegetation, and we reciprocally sowed cheatgrass seed sources from the three study sites. We quantified performance with per capita growth rate and its components (emergence, survival, and fecundity). The main effect of the warming treatment was significant and positive only at high elevation, where warming triggered a three- to six-fold increase in population growth rate. At the lower elevation sites, main effects of warming were always positive but not significant. Interactions between warming and seed source or competition were inconsistent across sites and years. As expected, competition from resident vegetation had strong and consistent negative effects on cheatgrass population growth rate, but it significantly limited warming effects only at the mid-elevation site in one year, presumably by decreasing soil water availability. High elevation seed sources performed best at all sites. Our results indicate that in northern Utah, warming has the potential to increase cheatgrass densities in years with normal to high precipitation, especially at high elevations, regardless of cheatgrass seed source.

Here we address the congruence among these three main approaches by comparing the degree to which tundra plant community composition changes (i) in response to in situ experimental warming, (ii) with interannual variability in summer temperature within sites, and (iii) over spatial gradients in summer temperature. We analyzed changes in plant community composition from repeat sampling (85 plant communities in 28 regions) and experimental warming studies (28 experiments in 14 regions) throughout arctic and alpine North America and Europe. Increases in the relative abundance of species with a warmer thermal niche were observed in response to warmer summer temperatures using all three methods; however, effect sizes were greater over broad-scale spatial gradients relative to either temporal variability in summer temperature within a site or summer temperature increases induced by experimental warming. The effect sizes for change over time within a site and with experimental warming were nearly identical. These results support the view that inferences based on space-for-time substitution overestimate the magnitude of responses to contemporary climate warming, because spatial gradients reflect long-term processes. In contrast, in situ experimental warming and monitoring approaches yield consistent estimates of the magnitude of response of plant communities to climate warming.",2015,NA,Journal article,climate; climate change; global warming; monitoring; plant communities; summer; temperature; temporal variation; yield components; palaeoecology; ecology,cabdirect,Yes,,,,,,

The assessment employed observations of sensitivity and response to climatic variability, downscaled climate projections, literature reviews, current management policies and practices, expert knowledge, and stakeholder engagement. Primary pathways for climate impacts focused on projected increases in extreme high flows and flooding, elevated winter soil moisture and landslide hazards, and loss of snowpack. The biggest impacts to roads and trails are expected from temperature-induced changes in hydrologic regimes that enhance autumn flooding and reduce spring snowpack. Projected higher winter soil moisture caused by changes in seasonal precipitation and snow accumulation could reduce slope stability. Earlier snowmelt may lengthen the snow-free season for visitor use and agency operations. Infrastructure age, design, maintenance, location, use, and limited redundancy along with funding policies and management, influence the sensitivities of the transportation system. Vulnerabilities were identified based on when and where these sensitivities to changes in climate may emerge. Adaptation strategies and tactics identified to address these vulnerabilities included: upgrading stream crossing and drainage design, changing use and maintenance, relocating or closing roads and trails, modifying funding policies, and expanding pubic engagement. Many adaptation options are ""no regrets"" approaches to changes in climate projected for the 2040s and 2080s that can be applied to other resource sectors and mountainous regions.",2015,NA,Journal article,assessment; autumn; climate; climate change; drainage; effects; flooding; forests; funding; hazards; impact; landslides; literature; moisture; mountain areas; national forests; National Parks; parks; policy; precipitation; projections; research; roads; seasonal variation; slope; slopes; snow; snow cover; soil water; stability; stakeholders; trails; variation; winter,cabdirect,Yes,,,,,,

Their setting is fire-prone, they have been altered by land-uses, and fire severity may be increasing. However, where fires were excluded, increased fire could also be hypothesized as restorative of historical fire. These competing hypotheses are not well tested, as reference data prior to widespread land-use expansion were insufficient. Moreover, fire-climate projections were lacking for these forests. Here, I used new reference data and records of high-severity fire from 1984-2012 across all dry forests (25.5 million ha) of the western USA to test these hypotheses. I also approximated projected effects of climatic change on high-severity fire in dry forests by applying existing projections. This analysis showed the rate of recent high-severity fire in dry forests is within the range of historical rates, or is too low, overall across dry forests and individually in 42 of 43 analysis regions. Significant upward trends were lacking overall from 1984-2012 for area burned and fraction burned at high severity. Upward trends in area burned at high severity were found in only 4 of 43 analysis regions. Projections for A.D. 2046-2065 showed high-severity fire would generally be still operating at, or have been restored to historical rates, although high projections suggest high-severity fire rotations that are too short could ensue in 6 of 43 regions. Programs to generally reduce fire severity in dry forests are not supported and have significant adverse ecological impacts, including reducing habitat for native species dependent on early-successional burned patches and decreasing landscape heterogeneity that confers resilience to climatic change. Some adverse ecological effects of high-severity fires are concerns.

Although water systems are complex, a need exists for a generalized representation of these systems to identify important components and linkages to guide scientific inquiry and aid water management. We developed an integrated Structure-Actor-Water framework (iSAW) to facilitate the understanding of and transitions to sustainable water systems. Our goal was to produce an interdisciplinary framework for water resources research that could address management challenges across scales (e.g., plot to region) and domains (e.g., water supply and quality, transitioning, and urban landscapes). The framework was designed to be generalizable across all human-environment systems, yet with sufficient detail and flexibility to be customized to specific cases. iSAW includes three major components: structure (natural, built, and social), actors (individual and organizational), and water (quality and quantity). Key linkages among these components include: (1) ecological/hydrologic processes, (2) ecosystem/geomorphic feedbacks, (3) planning, design, and policy, (4) perceptions, information, and experience, (5) resource access and risk, and (6) operational water use and management. We illustrate the flexibility and utility of the iSAW framework by applying it to two research and management problems: understanding urban water supply and demand in a changing climate and expanding use of green storm water infrastructure in a semi-arid environment.

C.; Woods, S.",Influences of vegetation disturbance on hydrogeomorphic response following wildfire.,Hydrological Processes,"Quantifying the linkages between vegetation disturbance by fire and the changes in hydrologic processes leading to post-fire erosional response remains a challenge. We measured the influence of fire severity, defined as vegetation disturbance (using a satellite-derived vegetation disturbance index, VDI), landscape features that organize hydrologic flow pathways (relief and elongation ratios), and pre-fire vegetation type on the probability of the occurrence of post-fire gully rejuvenation (GR). We combined field surveys across 270 burned low-order catchments (112 occurrences of GR) and geospatial analysis to generate a probabilistic model through logistic regression. VDI alone discriminated well between catchments where GR did and did not occur (area under the curve=0.78, model accuracy=0.72). The strong effect of vegetation disturbance on GR suggests that vegetation exerts a primary influence on the occurrence of infiltration excess run-off and post-fire erosion and that major gully erosion will not occur until fire consumes aboveground biomass. Other topographic and local factors also influenced GR response, including catchment elongation, per cent pre-fire shrub, mid-slope riparian vegetation, armoured headwaters, firehose effects, and concentration of severe burn in source areas. These factors highlight the need to consider vegetation effects in concert with local topography and site conditions to understand the propensity for flow accumulation leading to GR. We present a process-based conceptual hydrologic model where vegetation loss from fire decreases rainfall attenuation and surface roughness, leading to accelerated flow accumulation and erosion; these effects are also influenced by interactions between fire severity and landscape structure. The VDI metric provides a continuous measure of vegetation disturbance and, when placed in a hydrologic context, may improve quantitative analysis of burned-area susceptibility to erosive rainfall, hazard prediction, ecological effects of fire, landform evolution, and sensitivity to climate change.",2016,NA,Journal article,biomass; catchment hydrology; climate change; ecological disturbance; fire effects; forest fires; forests; gully erosion; hazards; infiltration; landscape; mathematical models; mountain areas; mountain forests; rain; relief; remote sensing; riparian vegetation; runoff; shrubs; stand characteristics; stand structure; surface roughness; topography; vegetation; vegetation types; watersheds; wildfires; woody plants,cabdirect,Yes,,,,,,

To better understand how shifts in both precipitation and semi-arid vegetation cover alter above-ground hydrological processes, we assessed how rain interception differs between snow and rain surface water input; how western juniper alters snowpack dynamics; and how these above-ground processes differ across western juniper, mountain big sagebrush and low sagebrush plant communities. We collected continuous surface water input with four large lysimeters, interspace and below-canopy snow depth data and conducted periodic snow surveys for two consecutive water years (2013 and 2014). The ratio of interspace to below-canopy surface water input was greater for snow relative to rain events, averaging 79.4% and 54.8%, respectively. The greater surface water input ratio for snow is in part due to increased deposition of redistributed snow under the canopy. We simulated above-ground energy and water fluxes in western juniper, low sagebrush and mountain big sagebrush for two 8-year periods under current and projected mid-21st century warmer temperatures with the Simultaneous Heat and Water (SHAW) model.

Here we examine the effect of bedrock permeability on MTT and MTT scaling relations by comparing 15 nested research catchments in western Oregon; half within the HJ Andrews Experimental Forest and half at the site of the Alsea Watershed Study. The two sites share remarkably similar vegetation, topography, and climate and differ only in bedrock permeability (one poorly permeable volcanic rock and the other more permeable sandstone). We found longer MTTs in the catchments with more permeable fractured and weathered sandstone bedrock than in the catchments with tight, volcanic bedrock (on average, 6.2 versus 1.8 years, respectively). At the permeable bedrock site, 67% of the variance in MTT across catchments scales was explained by drainage area, with no significant correlation to topographic characteristics. The poorly permeable site had opposite scaling relations, where MTT showed no correlation to drainage area but the ratio of median flow path length to median flow path gradient explained 91% of the variance in MTT across seven catchment scales. Despite these differences, hydrometric analyses, including flow duration and recession analysis, and storm response analysis, show that the two sites share relatively indistinguishable hydrodynamic behavior.

Such disturbance-catalyzed shifts are by nature stochastic, offering few opportunities to test these predictions. We capitalized on a landmark event exemplary of recent large disturbances - the 1988 wildfires in Yellowstone National Park (USA) - to investigate long-term (24-yr) regeneration dynamics in Douglas-fir (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Pseudotsuga menziesii</i> var. <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">glauca</i>) forests, which compose the lower treeline yet have received little study. We tested the hypothesis that, under current conditions (warmest decades in last 6000 yr), dry lower-margin stands are less apt to attain self-replacement than adjacent, but more mesic, stands farther from the ecotone. Mesic sites characterized by dense forests prefire regenerated robustly regardless of burn severity, even in large high-severity patches, whereas dry sites did so only if nearby seed sources survived (i.e., small patch size or moderate burn severity). Regeneration continued over two decades, peaking between ���������5 and 15 yr, with mesic stands continuing regenerating beyond 15 yr to a greater degree than dry stands. Self-replacement of stands by 24 yr postfire was nearly universal in mesic stands, variable but common in dry stands not adjacent to the lower ecotone, and uncommon in dry stands near the ecotone - particularly if burned at high severity. Whether the lack of regeneration in ecotonal stands is categorically directional with warming climate or part of a long-term cycle is unresolved, but we estimate that the 1988 fires converted &gt;4000 ha of lower-montane forest to grass/sage steppe for at least several decades, possibly indefinitely given current trends in climate.

The EW chronologies correlate more strongly and consistently with SWE records in regions where the growth relationship with SWE is negative. The LW chronologies, and particularly the Adjusted LW chronologies, exhibit a greater number of positive correlations with the set of SWE records.

D.",Regional diversity reverses the negative impacts of an alien predator on local species-poor communities.,Ecology,"Species diversity is often an implicit source of biological insurance for communities against the impacts of novel perturbations, such as the introduction of an invasive species. High environmental heterogeneity (e.g., a mountainous gradient) is expected to beget greater regional species diversity and variation in functional traits related to environmental tolerances. Thus, heterogeneous metacommunities are expected to provide more tolerant colonists that buffer stressed local communities in the absence of dispersal limitation. We tested the hypothesis that importation of a regional zooplankton pool assembled from a diverse array of lakes and ponds lessens the impacts of a novel predator on local species-poor alpine communities by increasing response diversity (i.e., diversity of tolerances to environmental change) as mediated by variation in functional traits related to predator evasion. We also tested whether impacts varied with temperature, as warming may modify (e.g., dampen or amplify) invasion effects.

Although the introduced predator suppressed local species richness and community biomass, colonization by several montane zooplankters reversed these negative effects, resulting in increased species diversity and production. Invasion resistance was unaffected by higher temperatures, which failed to elicit any significance impacts on the community. We discovered that the smaller body sizes of imported species drove functional overcompensation (i.e., increased production) in invaded communities. The observed ecological surprise showed how regionally sourced biodiversity from a highly heterogeneous landscape can offset, and even reverse, the local negative impacts of an invasive species. Further, prey body size was found to be a key species trait mediating the ecological impacts of the aquatic invasive predator.

A 21-day microcosm experiment that manipulated terrestrial DOM was used to determine the effect of DOM on zooplankton:phytoplankton biomass ratios (z:p). We predicted that if DOM additions increase the amount of fixed carbon available for higher trophic levels through stimulation of the microbial loop and hence zooplankton, the z:p will increase. However, if DOM additions increase other nutrients besides fixed carbon, we predict stable or decreasing z:p due to nutrient stimulation of phytoplankton that subsequently enhances zooplankton. The effects of experimental additions of terrestrially derived DOM on zooplankton, phytoplankton, z:p and zooplankton net grazing were assessed in microcosms (sealed bags) incubated in the epilimnion (shallow; 1.5 m) and hypolimnion (deep; 8.0 m) strata of an alpine lake. DOM addition treatments (DOM+) had a 6.0- to 7.5-fold increase in phytoplankton biomass relative to controls, but only a 1.3- to 1.5-fold increase in zooplankton biomass, on day 21 of the experiment. The z:p was, thus, lower in the DOM+ treatments (ratios: 2.3 deep and 4.4 shallow) than in the control treatments (ratios: 13.4 deep and 17.5 shallow), providing evidence that DOM additions provide nutrient subsidies besides fixed carbon that stimulate phytoplankton biomass accumulation. The increase in zooplankton biomass during the experiment was similar in magnitude to the total amount of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the DOM added in the sealed bags at the beginning of the experiment, which suggests zooplankton biomass stimulation due to increased phytoplankton biomass, and not from DOM through the microbial loop, which would have greater trophic transfer losses. The consumer net grazing effect in the DOM+ treatments was reduced by 2.8-fold in the shallow stratum and by 2.9-fold in the deep stratum relative to the control treatments, indicating that zooplankton were unable to exert strong top-down control on the primary producers. The role of nutrients needs to be considered when examining the response of pelagic ecosystems to inputs of terrestrial DOM, especially in lakes with lower DOC concentrations.",2017,NA,Journal article,aquatic organisms; aquatic plants; biomass; lakes; phytoplankton; plankton; trophic levels; zooplankton,cabdirect,Yes,,,,,,

Agee","Annual and decadal climate forcing of historical fire regimes in the interior Pacific Northwest, USA",The Holocene,"<ca> Anticipating the consequences of climatic change for fire requires understanding of the causes of variation in historical fire regimes. We assessed the influence of annual and decadal variation in climate on fire regimes of ponderosa pine-dominated forests in eastern Oregon and Washington using existing, annually dated tree-ring reconstructions (1687-1994). In four watersheds, we compared the extent of low-severity fires (total area burned each year) to precipitation and the Southern Oscillation Index, a measure of variation in El Ni<96>o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which affects weather in this region. At the annual scale, large fires burned during dry years and El Ni<96>o years (low SOI) in all watersheds while small fires burned regardless of variation in these climate parameters. Large fires also burned during relatively wet years and La Ni<96>a years (high SOI) in one watershed, indicating that local factors can override regional climate controls in some locations. Climate from previous years did not influence current year's fire extent. The influence of ENSO on fire regimes in this region has not previously been demonstrated at these multicentury, regional scales. At the decadal scale, fire extent varied with precipitation, perhaps in response to variation in such climate features as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. Several decades of low fire extent in the watersheds during the early 1800s was synchronous with a lack of fire at other sites in North and South America, probably in response to a change in the global climate that included a lessening in the frequency and/or intensity of ENSO events.",2002,NA,Scholarly Journals,NA,proquest,Yes,,,,,,

Part II: Mesoscale ENSO Anomalies,Journal of Climate,"The hydroclimate of the western United States is influenced by strong interannual variability of atmospheric circulation, much of which is associated with the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Precipitation anomalies during ENSO often show opposite and spatially coherent dry and wet patterns in the Northwest and California or vice versa. The role of orography in establishing mesoscale ENSO anomalies in the western United States is examined based on observed precipitation and temperature data at 1/8 degree spatial resolution and a regional climate simulation at 40-km spatial resolution. Results show that during El Nino or La Nina winters, strong precipitation anomalies are found in northern California, along the southern California coast, and in the northwest mountains such as the Olympic Mountains, the Cascades, and the northern Rockies. These spatial features, which are strongly affected by topography, are surprisingly well reproduced by the regional climate simulation. double prime spatial feature investigated further is the positive-negative-positive precipitation anomaly found during El Nino years in the Olympic Mountains, and on the west side and east side of the Cascades in both observations and regional simulation. Observed streamflows of river basins located in those areas are found to be consistent with the precipitation anomalies. The spatial distribution of the precipitation anomalies is investigated by relating flow direction and moisture to the orientation of mountains and orographic precipitation. On the west side of the north-south-oriented Cascade Range, the increase in atmospheric moisture is not enough to compensate for the loss of orographic precipitation associated with a change in flow direction toward the southwest during El Nino years. In California, both the increase in atmospheric moisture and shift in wind direction toward the southwest enhance precipitation along the Sierra, which is oriented northwest to southeast. The spatial signature of the interactions between large-scale circulation and topography may provide useful information for seasonal predictions or climate change detection.",2003,orography,Scholarly Journals,orography,proquest,Yes,,,,,,

In order to allow for a detailed comparison of the estimated precipitation with observations, the simulated precipitation is taken from the NCEP-NCAR reanalysis, which nearly perfectly represents the historic pressure, temperature, and humidity, but calculates precipitation according to the model physics and parameterizations.Three statistical downscaling methods are investigated: (i) local rescaling of the simulated precipitation, and two newly developed methods, namely, (ii) downscaling using singular value decomposition (SVD) with simulated precipitation as the predictor, and (iii) local rescaling with a dynamical correction. Both local scaling methods are straightforward to apply to GCMs that are used for climate change experiments and seasonal forecasts, since they only need control runs for model fitting. The SVD method requires for model fitting special reanalysis-type GCM runs nudged toward observations from a historical period (selection of analogs from the GCM chosen to optimally match the historical weather states might achieve similar results). The precipitation-based methods are compared with conventional statistical downscaling using SVD with various large-scale predictors such as geopotential height, temperature, and humidity.The skill of the different methods for reconstructing historical wintertime precipitation (1958-94) over Oregon and Washington is tested on various spatial scales as small as 50 km and on temporal scales from months to decades. All methods using precipitation as a predictor perform considerably better than the conventional downscaling. The best results using conventional methods are obtained with geopotential height at 1000 hPa or humidity at 850 hPa as predictors. In these cases correlations of monthly observed and reconstructed precipitation on the 50-km scale range from 0.43 to 0.65. The inclusion of several predictor fields does not improve the reconstructions, since they are all highly correlated. Local rescaling of simulated precipitation yields much higher correlations between 0.7 and 0.9, with the exception of the rain shadow of the Cascade Mountains in the Columbia Basin (eastern Washington). When the simulated precipitation is used as a predictor in SVD-based downscaling correlations also reach 0.7 in eastern Washington. Dynamical correction improves the local scaling considerably in the rain shadow and yields correlations almost as high as with the SVD method. Its combination of high skill and ease to use make it particularly attractive for GCM precipitation downscaling.",2003,NA,Scholarly Journals,NA,proquest,Yes,,,,,,

Cook",Twentieth-Century Sea Surface Temperature Patterns in the Pacific during Decadal Moisture Regimes over the United States,Earth Interactions,"<ca> Three great moisture anomalies were observed during the twentieth century over the western United States: a pluvial from 1905 to 1917, the Dust Bowl drought (1929-40), and the Southwestern drought of 1946-56. A composite analysis of the concurrent Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) field is used to infer the atmospheric circulation that may have been associated with these objectively defined decadal dry and wet periods. The early-twentieth-century pluvial occurred during a 13-yr SST regime with unusually cold water in the northern and northwestern North Pacific and in the eastern North Pacific. This pattern would favor a ""Pineapple Express-like"" mean storm track into the west. Warm ENSO-like conditions also observed during the pluvial would have favored an enhanced subtropical jet stream into the southwestern United States. The 11-yr Dust Bowl drought occurred during a poorly defined Pacific SST regime, although unusually cold water was present in the far western North Pacific. Weak warm SST conditions were also noted in the extreme northeastern North Pacific. This cold west-warm east SST pattern, although weak for the full 11-yr interval, may have contributed to positive atmospheric geopotential heights over the western and central United States during the Dust Bowl drought. Cooler SSTs in the eastern equatorial Pacific during some of the Dust Bowl years (e.g., 1934, 1935, 1938, and 1939) suggest a possible La Ni<96>a influence. La Ni<96>a conditions definitely seemed to have contributed to the 1950s drought, but the most anomalous SSTs for the 11-yr average were observed in the west-central North Pacific. The overall Pacific SST field during the 1946-56 drought was consistent with the cool phase of the Pacific decadal oscillation, and the warm SSTs in the west-central North Pacific would have favored a trough over the central North Pacific and a ridge over western North America in the upper-tropospheric flow.

This groundwork study is presented as a precedent to distributed simulation modeling of surface hydrologic flows in large river basins. Correlation analysis is used as a screening method to classify river basins into categories based on major controls on discharge, for example, climate, land use, and dams. Comparisons of paired station records at upstream and downstream discharge locations within each major river basin suggest that the discharge signals represented in upstream discharge records are sustained in the downstream station records for nearly two-thirds of the drainage basins selected. River basins that showed the strongest localized climate control over historical discharge records, in terms of correlations with net basinwide precipitation rates, are located mainly in the seasonally warm temperate and tropical latitude zones, as opposed to river basins located mainly in the higher latitude zones (above 45 degrees N). Ocean climate indices such as the Nino1+2 and Nino3+4 correlate highly with historical interannual patterns in monthly river discharge for only four of the selected discharge station records, namely, on the Amazon, Congo (Zaire), Columbia, and Colorado (Arizona) Rivers. Historical patterns of cropland development and irrigated areas may explain the weak climate correlations with interannual patterns in monthly river discharge rates for at least one-third of the major river drainages selected from the historical discharge dataset.

Sloan",Transient Future Climate over the Western United States Using a Regional Climate Model,Earth Interactions,"<ca> Regional climate models (RCMs) have improved our understanding of the effects of global climate change on specific regions. The need for realistic forcing has led to the use of fully coupled global climate models (GCMs) to produce boundary conditions for RCMs. The advantages of using fully coupled GCM output is that the global-scale interactions of all components of the climate system (ocean, sea ice, land surface, and atmosphere) are considered. This study uses an RCM, driven by a fully coupled GCM, to examine the climate of a region centered over California for the time periods 1980-99 and 2080-99. Statistically significant increases in mean monthly temperatures by up to 7<a1>C are found for the entire state. Large changes in precipitation occur in northern California in February (increase of up to 4 mm day-1 or 30%) and March (decrease of up to 3 mm day-1 or 25%). However, in most months, precipitation changes between the cases were not statistically significant. Statistically significant decreases in snow accumulation of over 100 mm (50%) occur in some months. Temperature increases lead to decreases in snow accumulation that impact the hydrologic budget by shifting spring and summer runoff into the winter months, reinforcing results of other studies that used different models and driving conditions.

Graumlich","Long-Duration Drought Variability and Impacts on Ecosystem Services: A Case Study from Glacier National Park, Montana",Earth Interactions,"<ca> Instrumental climate records suggest that summer precipitation and winter snowpack in Glacier National Park (Glacier NP), Montana, vary significantly over decadal to multidecadal time scales. Because instrumental records for the region are limited to the twentieth century, knowledge of the range of variability associated with these moisture anomalies and their impacts on ecosystems and physical processes are limited. The authors developed a reconstruction of summer (June-August) moisture variability spanning a.d. 1540-2000 from a multispecies network of tree-ring chronologies in Glacier NP. Decadal-scale drought and pluvial regimes were defined as any event lasting 10 yr or greater, and the significance of each potential regime was assessed using intervention analysis. Intervention analysis prevents single intervening years of average or opposing moisture conditions from ending what was otherwise a sustained moisture regime. The reconstruction shows numerous decadal-scale shifts between persistent drought and wet events prior to the instrumental period (before a.d. 1900). Notable wet events include a series of three long-duration, high-magnitude pluvial regimes spanning the end of the Little Ice Age (a.d. 1770-1840). Though the late-nineteenth century was marked by a series of &gt;10 yr droughts, the single most severe dry event occurred in the early-twentieth century (a.d. 1917-41). These decadal-scale dry and wet events, in conjunction with periods of high and low snowpack, have served as a driver of ecosystem processes such as forest fires and glacial dynamics in the Glacier NP region. Using a suite of paleoproxy reconstructions and information from previous studies examining the relationship between climate variability and natural processes, the authors explore how such persistent moisture anomalies affect the delivery of vital goods and services provided by Glacier NP and surrounding areas. These analyses show that regional water resources and tourism are particularly vulnerable to persistent moisture anomalies in the Glacier NP area. Many of these same decadal-scale wet and dry events were also seen among a wider network of hydroclimatic reconstructions along a north-south transect of the Rocky Mountains. Such natural climate variability can, in turn, have enormous impacts on the sustainable provision of natural resources over wide areas. Overall, these results highlight the susceptibility of goods and services provided by protected areas like Glacier NP to natural climate variability, and show that this susceptibility will likely be compounded by the effects of future human-induced climate change.

In addition to the changes in the amounts of precipitation and temperature usually assumed in hydrological climate change studies, the following parameters were considered; the effect of climate on the spatial distribution of precipitation with elevation, and on cloud cover, glaciers, vegetation distribution, vegetation biomass production, and plant physiology. The mean annual temperature in the two watersheds could increase by more than 3���������������C and the annual basin-wide precipitation could increase by 7.5% in Upper Campbell watershed and by ��������� 17% in the Illecillewaet watershed.

Two methods of climate scenario generation were compared: delta change and statistical downscaling. The delta change method uses differences between simulated current and future climate conditions from the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research (HadCM2) General Circulation Model (GCM) added to observed time series of climate variables. A statistical downscaling (SDS) model was developed for each basin using station data and output from the National Center for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) reanalysis regridded to the scale of HadCM2. The SDS model was then used to simulate local climate variables using HadCM2 output for current and future conditions. Surface climate variables from each scenario were used in a precipitation-runoff model. Results show that, in the basins tested, a precipitation-runoff model can simulate realistic runoff series for current conditions using statistically down-scaled NCEP output. But, use of downscaled HadCM2 output for current or future climate assessments are questionable because the GCM does not produce accurate estimates of the surface variables needed for runoff in these regions. Given the uncertainties in the GCMs ability to simulate current conditions based on either the delta change or downscaling approaches, future climate assessments based on either of these approaches must be treated with caution.",2000,NA,Journal article,atmosphere; circulation; climate; climate change; models; mountains; precipitation; research; runoff; time series,cabdirect,Yes,,,,,,

Response function analyses were used to compare climate-growth relationships among 12 sites, four elevations on three different mountains. Response function analysis attributes 42-55% of the inter-annual variation in growth to climate. Growth was positively correlated with November precipitation prior to the growing season on all 12 sites, suggesting that November precipitation was critical for increased root growth, increased nutrient availability through decomposition, building snowpack, or non-growing season photosynthesis and carbon storage. Growth was positively correlated with previous October, January, June, and July precipitation at more than one site. Temperature was not correlated with growth on any sites. Climate models predict that the Pacific Northwest will experience warmer and wetter winters and drier summers in the future. Growth-climate correlations suggest that the short-term growth response of ponderosa pine was most sensitive to non-growing season precipitation. Therefore, predicting ponderosa pine's response to projected climatic change was problematic, with wetter falls increasing growth and drier summers decreasing growth.

In two of three years, trees on cooler microsites broke bud 2 to 4 days earlier than those on warmer microsites, despite receiving less heat forcing from March to May each year.

The PRISM mapping system used in this study has greatly improved the spatial mapping of precipitation and increased the reliability of estimates of precipitation in the broad areas between precipitation measurement stations. Further, the development and use of regional L-Moments has greatly improved the reliability of precipitation magnitude-frequency estimates, particularly for the rarer and more extreme storms.

We also test the hypothesis of a diversification rate shift within NAm Psoraleeae using topological and temporal methods. We investigate the impact of climate change on diversification in this group by (1) testing the hypothesis that a shift from mesic to xeric habitats acted as a key innovation and (2) investigating diversification rate shifts along geologic time, discussing the impact of Quaternary climate oscillations on diversification. Results: NAm Psoraleeae represents a recent, rapid radiation with several genera originating during the Pleistocene, 1 to 2 million years ago. A shift in diversification rate is supported by both methods with a 2.67-fold increase suggested around 2 million years ago followed by a 8.73-fold decrease 440,000 years ago. The hypothesis that a climate regime shift from mesic to xeric habitats drove increased diversification in affected taxa was not supported. Timing of the diversification rate increase supports the hypothesis that glaciation-induced climate changes during the Quaternary influenced diversification of the group. Nonrandom spatial diversification also exists, with greater species richness in the American Southwest. Conclusion: This study outlines NAm Psoraleeae as a model example of a recent, rapid radiation.

G.",Controls on the temporal and spatial variability of soil moisture in a mountainous landscape: the signature of snow and complex terrain.,Hydrology and Earth System Sciences,"The controls on the spatial distribution of soil moisture include static and dynamic variables. The superposition of static and dynamic controls can lead to different soil moisture patterns for a given catchment during wetting, draining, and drying periods. These relationships can be further complicated in snow-dominated mountain regions where soil water input by precipitation is largely dictated by the spatial variability of snow accumulation and melt. In this study, we assess controls on spatial and temporal soil moisture variability in a small (0.02 km<sup xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">2</sup>), snow-dominated, semi-arid catchment by evaluating spatial correlations between soil moisture and site characteristics through different hydrologic seasons. We assess the relative importance of snow with respect to other catchment properties on the spatial variability of soil moisture and track the temporal persistence of those controls. Spatial distribution of snow, distance from divide, soil texture, and soil depth exerted significant control on the spatial variability of moisture content throughout most of the hydrologic year. These relationships were strongest during the wettest period and degraded during the dry period. As the catchment cycled through wet and dry periods, the relative spatial variability of soil moisture tended to remain unchanged. We suggest that the static properties in complex terrain (slope, aspect, soils) impose first order controls on the spatial variability of snow and resulting soil moisture patterns, and that the interaction of dynamic (timing of water input) and static influences propagate that relative constant spatial variability through most of the hydrologic year. The results demonstrate that snow exerts significant influence on how water is retained within mid-elevation semi-arid catchments and suggest that reductions in annual snowpacks associated with changing climate regimes may strongly influence spatial and temporal soil moisture patterns and catchment physical and biological processes.",2009,NA,Journal article,characteristics; climate; climate change; drying; evaluation; interactions; moisture; moisture content; persistence; properties; seasons; semiarid zones; slope; snow; soil; soil depth; soil texture; soil water; spatial distribution; spatial variation; wetting,cabdirect,Yes,,,,,,

A global climate model was first applied at 1������ ������ 1.25������ grid resolution with a subgrid orographic precipitation scheme. The global simulations were then used to drive a regional climate model at 15-km grid resolution over the Western United States. By comparing the global and regional simulations for two 10-year periods, 1993-2003 and 2039-2049, this study assesses the two downscaling methods in the context of simulating both the present climate and climate change signals, and the implications of the relatively short simulation length to investigate differences in current and future climate simulated by the models are discussed. The model results show that improving the representation of surface topography through higher spatial resolution or a subgrid method has a large impact on the simulations. Both the subgrid scheme and the regional model significantly improved the simulation of snowpack in the mountains. The spatial distributions of precipitation and snowpack are generally consistent between the subgrid and regional simulations, since they were driven by the same large-scale circulation from the global simulations. However, because rain-shadow effects are not represented in the subgrid scheme, the regional simulations produced much more realistic spatial variability in precipitation and snowpack than the subgrid simulations in narrow mountain ranges. In the climate change experiments, both downscaling procedures preserved the large-scale patterns of temperature and precipitation changes in the global simulations. However, the regional simulations show larger changes in precipitation and snowpack along the coastal mountains than the subgrid simulations. This is attributed to the fact that the regional model explicitly simulates the interactions of atmospheric circulation and the underlying topography, so changes in wind directions with respect to the orientations of the mountains may lead to changes in orographic precipitation that cannot be explained by changes in atmospheric temperature and moisture alone. Hence differences between the precipitation changes simulated by the regional model and the subgrid method are larger in narrow mountains such as the Cascades and the Sierra Nevada because the subgrid method does not account for the influence of mountain orientations at the subgrid scale. As precipitation is an important driver of surface hydrological processes, differences between the precipitation changes simulated by the two methods lead to important differences in the surface hydrological processes under climate change.",2010,NA,Journal article,atmosphere; circulation; climate; climate change; hydrology; interactions; meteorology; models; moisture; mountains; precipitation; prediction; signals; simulation; spatial variation; temperature; topography; wind,cabdirect,Yes,,,,,,

Tree mortality caused by natural disturbances has always been a part of wild and managed forests, but climate change is accentuating the uncertainty around such losses. Policy responses to accelerate overall timber harvesting levels to prevent further tree mortality and to aggressively salvage value from dead wood before it deteriorates can be disruptive and even counter-productive in the long run. Current alternatives are to strategically redirect existing timber harvesting quotas to the most vulnerable areas, minimize overall uplifts in cutting activity, prolong the period over which harvested timber can be processed, avoid the harvesting of mixed species stands or those with good advance regeneration, employ more partial cutting or ""selective logging"" techniques, and relax standards for acceptable species and inter-tree spacing during post-disturbance stand recovery. At the same time, careful attention to species composition and evolving landscape risk profiles may facilitate adaptation to anticipated climate change and reduce vulnerability to future disturbances. Harvest levels must be set conservatively over the full planning horizon if it is important to assure continuity of the timber supply with few disruptions to regional socio-economics and less stress to ecosystems. Broader lessons in sustainability include the option to emphasize persistence, continuity and flexibility over the long term, though at the expense of maximized production and full resource utilization in the short term.",2010,NA,Journal article,dead wood; ecological disturbance; forest management; forest pests; forest policy; forests; harvesting; insect pests; mortality; outbreaks; plant pests; salvage felling and logging; selective felling; sustainability,cabdirect,Yes,,,,,,

Results: Trees established during two broad, but distinct periods (late 1800s, then at much greater density in the mid-1900s).

3368,NA,"Mori, A. S.",Climatic variability regulates the occurrence and extent of large fires in the subalpine forests of the Canadian Rockies.,Ecosphere,"Drought occurrence and wildfire activity in subalpine forests in Kootenay National Park (KNP) of the Canadian Rockies are studied by focusing on the interannual and multi-decadal variations in climate patterns of the Pacific Ocean. The question addressed is whether broad-scale climate patterns can regulate both large fire occurrence and fire-free periods causing fuel buildups. This study compared years of large wildfire outbreaks for the subalpine forests of KNP during the last three centuries using indices of climate patterns of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and El Ni������o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). PDO and ENSO were correlated with drought and fire occurrence in KNP. A positive PDO-positive ENSO combination created extreme drought conducive to crown fires, indicating that the occurrence of high-severity wildfires in these generally moist/cool forests is strongly determined by climatic anomalies. Large fire activity is chiefly modulated by PDO compared to ENSO, because a negative PDO phase greatly decreased fire activity in the mid-twentieth century. Although this fire-free period is seemingly matched with a fire-suppression period, it may be attributable to a negative PDO, which increased precipitation in the region. This mid-century fire gap contributed to the accumulation of old forests serving as loaded fuels within the landscape and ultimately led to occurrences of crown fires as the PDO shifted to the positive phase. Thus, in addition to the fundamental importance of interannual variations in the Pacific that initiates a current-year severe drought, multi-decadal scale climate variability also influences the extent and severity of subsequent fires by modulating pre-fire landscape conditions. For fire management in subalpine areas of the Rockies, although drought occurrence is a primary concern and there are still uncertainties in the detailed changes in fire risk through the successional process, it is worth paying attention to fuel-loads of older forests in the landscape, which may lead to extensive large fires. Because the climatic teleconnection pattern is one of the main drivers of crown fire occurrence in the region in terms of creating current summer drought, and also for constructing a landscape structure prone to larger fires, more of a focus on short to long-term variations in the climate for wildfire management is needed in high-elevation forested landscapes.",2011,NA,Journal article,climate change; drought; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; forest fires; forests; global warming; old-growth forests; precipitation; subalpine forests; uncertainty; wildfires,cabdirect,Yes,,,,,,

Current data suggest that many alpine species will be lost to changes in habitat wrought by climate, particularly increases in average temperatures. For many wetlands, particularly in the central and southern interior of the province, the basic issue is simple - the incoming water is decreasing and the outgoing water (evaporation) is increasing. The authors illustrate three approaches to projecting trends in wetland habitat, elaborating on the ""drying index"" approach, in which they have most confidence. For wetland species, they say management will struggle with the concept of a real-world triage-allocating conservation efforts where they are most likely to succeed and have the most benefit.

We sought to determine whether wood microsites (i.e., nurse logs), which are regeneration sites in Pacific Northwest subalpine forests, promoted regeneration at timberline-alpine meadow borders. To determine the ecological role of wood microsites, we examined mechanisms forming wood microsites; compared density, survival, and percent nitrogen content of seedlings growing on wood microsites to adjacent soil substrates; and compared substrate moisture, temperature, and percent nitrogen content. Wood microsites, at 13 of 14 randomly selected sites, were characterized by highly decayed downed wood (&gt;75% decay class five) originating from tree fall (66%), snow avalanches (17%), forest fires (15%), and by human cutting (2%).

A.",Biodiversity indicators show climate change will alter vegetation in parks and protected areas.,Diversity,"While multifaceted, a chief aim when designating parks and protected areas is to support the preservation of biological diversity, in part, through representing and conserving the full range of landscape conditions observed throughout a representative area. Parks and protected areas are, however, typically developed using a static interpretation of current biodiversity and landscape conditions. The observed and potential climate change impacts to biodiversity have created a need to also contemplate how parks and protected areas will respond to climate change and how these areas will represent the future range of landscape conditions. To assess change in biodiversity, broad-scale ecosystem information can be sourced from indirect remotely sensed indicators. Quantifying biodiversity through indirect indicators allows characterization of inter-relationships between climate and biodiversity. Such characterizations support the assessment of possible implications of climatic change, as the indicators can be generated using modeled forecasts of future climatic conditions. In this paper we model and map impacts of climate change on British Columbia's parks and protected areas by quantifying change in a number of remotely sensed indicators of biodiversity. These indicators are based on the measured amount of incoming solar energy used by vegetation and map the overall annual energy utilization, variability (seasonality), and latent or baseline energy. We compare current conditions represented by parks and protected areas, to those forecasted in the year 2065. Our results indicate that parks and protected areas are forecasted to become more productive and less seasonal, due to increased vegetation productivity in higher elevation environments. While increased vegetation productivity may be beneficial for biodiversity overall, these changes will be particularly problematic for sensitive and specialist species. Future gaps in vegetation conditions protected by parks and protected areas are observed in the eastern edge of the Rocky Mountains and the central interior region of British Columbia. Protected areas along the Coast Mountains, Vancouver Island highlands, and the Rocky Mountains show the greatest levels of change in the biodiversity indicators, including decreasing seasonality, with the Mountain Hemlock ecozone most at risk. Examples of large parks that are predicted to experience rapid change in vegetation characteristics include Strathcona, Garabaldi, and Kitlope.

To facilitate the use of this decision support framework, we mapped scenarios of future stream flow and temperature in the Pacific Northwest region and reviewed literature on habitat restoration actions to determine whether they ameliorate a climate change effect or increase life history diversity and salmon resilience.

Considering projected increases in air temperature and changes in precipitation in the coming century, accurate assessment of suitable thermal habitats in freshwater systems is critical for predicting aquatic species' responses to changes in climate and for guiding adaptation strategies. We use a hydrologic model coupled with a stream temperature model and downscaled general circulation model outputs to explore the spatially and temporally varying changes in stream temperature for the late 21st century at the subbasin and ecological province scale for the Columbia River basin (CRB). On average, stream temperatures are projected to increase 3.5������C for the spring, 5.2������C for the summer, 2.7������C for the fall, and 1.6������C for the winter. While results indicate changes in stream temperature are correlated with changes in air temperature, our results also capture the important, and often ignored, influence of hydrological processes on changes in stream temperature. Decreases in future snowcover will result in increased thermal sensitivity within regions that were previously buffered by the cooling effect of flow originating as snowmelt. Other hydrological components, such as precipitation, surface runoff, lateral soil water flow, and groundwater inflow, are negatively correlated to increases in stream temperature depending on the ecological province and season. At the ecological province scale, the largest increase in annual stream temperature was within the Mountain Snake ecological province, which is characterized by migratory coldwater fish species. Stream temperature changes varied seasonally with the largest projected stream temperature increases occurring during the spring and summer for all ecological provinces. Our results indicate that stream temperatures are driven by local processes and ultimately require a physically explicit modeling approach to accurately characterize the habitat regulating the distribution and diversity of aquatic taxa.",2014,NA,Journal article,air; air temperature; aquatic animals; aquatic organisms; assessment; characterization; circulation; climate; climate change; cooling; diversity; fresh water; groundwater; habitats; hydrology; models; persistence; projections; rivers; runoff; soil water; spatial variation; summer; temperature; variation; water flow; watersheds; winter,cabdirect,Yes,,,,,,

We quantified the response of invertebrates and basal food resources in 6 wilderness streams in central Idaho USA for 8 years pre-fire and 5 years post-fire. We found that a shift in climate toward increased temperature and reduced peaks in snow-melt runoff moderated the effects of wildfire on basal food resources and altered invertebrate community structure and annual variation. Taxon richness significantly increased over the 13-year study period at all sites regardless of fire. Post-fire changes were accompanied by an increase in the relative abundances of chironomid midges and <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Baetis</i> mayflies, which generally are regarded as disturbance-adapted taxa. Ordination analysis of invertebrate community biomass showed that both unburned and burned streams differed between pre- and post-fire years and combined, our results suggest that the effects of climate ameliorated the effects of fire. We found significant correlations between community structure and climatic variables of precipitation, temperature, and discharge in all streams. Our findings support previous studies that attribute a large part of negative fire effects on stream ecosystems to major increases in runoff from sparsely vegetated uplands and attendant restructuring of channels and substrata. However, we found during a period of climate warming and reduction in snow-melt runoff, these adverse effects were suppressed resulting in increases in basal food resources and invertebrate density and biomass following fire.

Nevertheless, few studies have measured how climatic variation influences genetic diversity within populations or how genetic diversity is distributed across space relative to future climatic stress. Here, we tested whether patterns of genetic diversity (allelic richness) were related to climatic variation and habitat features in 130 bull trout (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Salvelinus confluentus</i>) populations from 24 watersheds (i.e., ���������4-7th order river subbasins) across the Columbia River Basin, USA. We then determined whether bull trout genetic diversity was related to climate vulnerability at the watershed scale, which we quantified on the basis of exposure to future climatic conditions (projected scenarios for the 2040s) and existing habitat complexity. We found a strong gradient in genetic diversity in bull trout populations across the Columbia River Basin, where populations located in the most upstream headwater areas had the greatest genetic diversity. After accounting for spatial patterns with linear mixed models, allelic richness in bull trout populations was positively related to habitat patch size and complexity, and negatively related to maximum summer temperature and the frequency of winter flooding. These relationships strongly suggest that climatic variation influences evolutionary processes in this threatened species and that genetic diversity will likely decrease due to future climate change.

These zones support trees and shrubs whose life stages are adapted to specific habitat types and consequently forest composition and successional stage reflect the underlying hydrogeomorphic processes and history. In this study we investigated woodland vegetation composition, successional stage and habitat properties, and compared these with physically-based indicators of hydraulic processes. We thus sought to develop a hydrogeomorphic model to evaluate riparian woodland condition based on the spatial mosaic of successional phases of the floodplain forest. The study investigated free-flowing and dam-impacted reaches of the Kootenai and Flathead Rivers, in Idaho and Montana, USA and British Columbia, Canada. The analyses revealed strong correspondence between vegetation assessments and metrics of fluvial processes indicating morphodynamics (erosion and shear stress), inundation and depth to groundwater. The results indicated that common successional stages generally occupied similar hydraulic environments along the different river segments. Comparison of the spatial patterns between the free-flowing and regulated reaches revealed greater deviation from the natural condition for the braided channel segment than for the meandering segment.

Forest communities are expected to lose cold-adapted trees near their low latitude/elevation range limits, while warm-adapted trees should increase in abundance near their high latitude/elevation limits (i.e., 'thermophilization'). However, slow-growing and long-lived trees, paired with climatic sensitivities that differ by species could add complexity to these predictions. To address these possibilities, we use demographic data collected from Mount Rainier National Park to examine: (1) the likelihood of rapid population growth or decline near range limits; (2) differences in climatic sensitivities between tree species at juvenile and adult stages; and (3) whether forest communities have already changed in response to recent warming. Our results suggest focal species are unlikely to shift their ranges rapidly with warming because recruit densities are low and time to reproductive maturity slow near upper range limits, while survival of adult trees is high near lower range limits. Additionally, focal tree species differ in the magnitude and strength of responses at seed and adult stages to climatic factors likely to be altered by warming. Consistent with these findings, shifts in forest community composition over the last 35 years were small, and not consistent with thermophilization predictions. In all, results imply that climate change will only have small, but unpredictable impacts on forest composition in the near-term.

As such, these characteristics can inform thinking on refugia. The published floras or approximations for 42 mountain ranges in the three major mountain systems (Sierra-Cascades, Rocky Mountains and Great Basin ranges) across the western USA and southwestern Canada were analysed. The similarity is higher among the ranges of the Rockies while equally low among the ranges of the Sierra-Cascades and Great Basin. Mantel correlations of similarity with geographic distance are also higher for the Rocky Mountains. Endemism is relatively high, but is highest in the Sierra-Cascades (due to the Sierra Nevada as the single largest range) and lowest in the Great Basin, where assemblages are allochthonous. These differences indicate that the geologic substrates of the Cascade volcanoes, which are much younger than any others, play a role in addition to geographic isolation in community assembly. The pattern of similarity and endemism indicates that the ranges of the Cascades will not function well as stepping stones and the endemic species that they harbor may need more protection than those of the Rocky Mountains.

The extreme climates in those environments also preclude invasions by most non-native species, so identifying especially cold habitats capable of absorbing future climate change while still supporting native populations would highlight important refugia. By coupling crowd-sourced biological datasets with high-resolution stream temperature scenarios, we delineate network refugia across &gt;250 000 stream km in the Northern Rocky Mountains for two native salmonids - bull trout (BT) and cutthroat trout (CT). Under both moderate and extreme climate change scenarios, refugia with high probabilities of trout population occupancy (&gt;0.9) were predicted to exist (33-68 BT refugia; 917-1425 CT refugia).

Forecasts of refuge locations could enable protection of key watersheds and provide a foundation for climate smart planning of conservation networks.

We assessed future projected changes in temperature and precipitation, shifts in major vegetation types, and vertebrate species turnover for the protected areas of the Pacific Northwestern region of North America. In general, the degree of projected change in the three metrics followed a longitudinal gradient from the Pacific coast inland toward the continental interior.

These outbreaks have led to spirited scientific, public, and policy debates about consequential increases in fire risk, especially in the wildland-urban interface (WUI), where homes and communities are at particular risk from wildfires. At the same time, large wildfires have become more frequent across this region. Widespread expectations that outbreaks increase extent, severity, and/or frequency of wildfires are based partly on visible and dramatic changes in foliar moisture content and other fuel properties following outbreaks, as well as associated modeling projections. A competing explanation is that increasing wildfires are driven primarily by climatic extremes, which are becoming more common with climate change. However, the relative importance of bark beetle outbreaks vs. climate on fire occurrence has not been empirically examined across very large areas and remains poorly understood. The most extensive outbreaks of tree-killing insects across the western United States have been of mountain pine beetle (MPB; <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Dendroctonus ponderosae</i>), which have killed trees over &gt;650,000 km<sup xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">2</sup>, mostly in forests dominated by lodgepole pine (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Pinus contorta</i>).

Here crossbills and pine are engaged in a coevolutionary arms race. Although most of the seeds remain secured within the cones for decades until the heat of a stand-replacing fire causes the cone scales to separate, seeds become accessible to crossbills slowly as cones weather and gaps form between some of the scales. However, hot days (���������32������C), especially four or more hot days, seem to mimic the effect of fire, apparently causing the immediate release of a fraction of the seeds. Such events caused a 20% annual decline in crossbills that lasted up to 4 years and an 80% decline in the population between 2003 and 2011. This is an example of a novel trophic mismatch between a consumer and its resource caused by a shift in the phenology of the resource arising from climate change.

However, the extent of and gaps in such knowledge have not been systematically investigated for mountain areas. This paper analyzes the status of knowledge from natural science disciplines and research needs relevant to the national and subnational climate adaptation policies of 1 US state (Washington) and 7 countries (Austria, Bhutan, Colombia, Germany, Nepal, Peru, and Switzerland), in particular the elements of those policies focused on mountain areas. In addition, we asked key individuals involved in drafting those policies to answer a short questionnaire. We found that research needs mainly concern impact and vulnerability assessments at regional and local levels, integrated assessments, and improved climate and socioeconomic data. These needs are often related to the challenges to data coverage and model performance in mountainous areas. In these areas, the base data are often riddled with gaps and uncertainties, making it particularly difficult to formulate adaptation strategies. In countries where data coverage is less of an issue, there is a tendency to explore quantitative forms of impact and vulnerability assessments. We highlight how the knowledge embedded in natural science disciplines is not always useful to address complex vulnerabilities in coupled human and natural systems and briefly refer to alternative pathways to adaptation in the form of no-regret, flexible, and adaptive management solutions.

In addition to altering the timing and magnitude of streamflow, climate change can affect the energy available to transport sediment, as well as the availability of sediment to be transported. These hydrologic changes are sensitive to local climate, which is largely controlled by topography, but climate models cannot resolve processes at these scales. Here, I investigate impacts of climate change on streamflow and suspended-sediment transport for three snowmelt-dominated rivers in the interior Pacific Northwest - the Tucannon River in Washington and the South Fork Coeur d'Alene and Red rivers in Idaho - using downscaled climate simulations from regional climate models (a range of three models plus an ensemble average) to drive a basin-scale hydrologic model. The results indicate that climate change is likely to amplify the annual cycle of river discharge, producing higher winter discharge (increases in ensemble mean January discharge ranging from 4.1% to 34.4% for the three rivers), an earlier spring snowmelt peak (by approximately one month), and lower summer discharge (decreases in ensemble mean July discharge ranging from 5.2% to 47.2%), relative to a late 20th-century baseline. The magnitude of the largest simulated flood under the ensemble-average climate change scenario increases by 0.6-41.6% across the three rivers.

Two key mechanisms underpinning hypotheses are: (1) reduced seed availability in large stand-replacing burn patches, and (2) reduced seedling establishment/survival after post-fire drought. We tested for regional evidence consistent with these mechanisms in an extensive fire-prone forest biome by assessing post-fire tree seedling establishment, a key indicator of forest resilience. Location: Subalpine forests, US Rocky Mountains. Methods: We analysed post-fire tree seedling establishment from 184 field plots where stand-replacing forest fires were followed by varying post-fire climate conditions. Generalized linear mixed models tested how establishment rates varied with post-fire drought severity and distance to seed source (among other relevant factors) for tree species with contrasting post-fire regeneration adaptations. Results Total post-fire tree seedling establishment (all species combined) declined sharply with greater post-fire drought severity and with greater distance to seed sources (i.e. the interior of burn patches).

We sought to increase the understanding of climate influences on mountain pine beetle outbreaks in whitebark pine forests, which are less well understood than in lodgepole pine, by quantifying climate-beetle relationships, analyzing climate influences during the recent outbreak, and estimating the suitability of future climate for beetle outbreaks. We developed a statistical model of the probability of whitebark pine mortality in the GYE that included temperature effects on beetle development and survival, precipitation effects on host tree condition, beetle population size, and stand characteristics. Estimated probability of whitebark pine mortality increased with higher winter minimum temperature, indicating greater beetle winter survival; higher fall temperature, indicating synchronous beetle emergence; lower two-year summer precipitation, indicating increased potential for host tree stress; increasing beetle populations; stand age; and increasing percent composition of whitebark pine within a stand. The recent outbreak occurred during a period of higher-than-normal regional winter temperatures, suitable fall temperatures, and low summer precipitation. In contrast to lodgepole pine systems, area with mortality was linked to precipitation variability even at high beetle populations. Projections from climate models indicate future climate conditions will likely provide favorable conditions for beetle outbreaks within nearly all current whitebark pine habitat in the GYE by the middle of this century. Therefore, when surviving and regenerating trees reach ages suitable for beetle attack, there is strong potential for continued whitebark pine mortality due to mountain pine beetle.",2016,NA,Journal article,climate; climate change; coniferous forests; ecology; ecosystems; effects; endangered species; forest pests; forests; fungal diseases; models; mortality; national parks; outbreaks; pathogens; pines; plant pathogenic fungi; plant pathogens; precipitation; regeneration; relationships; rust diseases; stand age; stand characteristics; summer; survival; temperature,cabdirect,Yes,,,,,,

The model simulates seasonal and annual water balance components including evaporation, transpiration, storage changes, deep drainage, and trends in streamflow. Independent measurements were used to parameterize the model, including forest transpiration, stomatal feedback to vapour pressure, forest properties (height, leaf area index, and biomass), soil properties, soil moisture, snow depth, and snow water equivalent. No calibrations were applied to fit the simulated streamflow to observations. The model reasonably simulated the annual runoff variations during the evaluation period from water year 2004 to 2009, which verified the ability of SHAW to simulate the water budget in this small watershed. The simulations indicated that inter-annual variations in streamflow were driven by variations in precipitation and soil water storage.

Although the disturbance products (tracking the conversion from forest to non-forest type) derived using the Landsat Time Series Stack-Vegetation Change Tracker (LTSS-VCT) algorithm have been validated extensively for mapping forest disturbances across the United States, the ability of this approach to characterize long-term post-disturbance recovery (the conversion from non-forest to forest) has yet to be assessed. In this study, the LTSS-VCT approach was applied to examine long-term (up to 24 years) post-disturbance forest spectral recovery following stand-clearing disturbances (fire and harvests) in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE). Using high spatial resolution images from Google Earth, we validated the detectable forest recovery status mapped by VCT by year 2011. Validation results show that the VCT was able to map long-term post-disturbance forest recovery with overall accuracy of ���������80% for different disturbance types and forest types in the GYE. Harvested areas in the GYE have higher percentages of forest recovery than burned areas by year 2011, and National Forests land generally has higher recovery rates compared with National Parks. The results also indicate that forest recovery is highly related with forest type, elevation and environmental variables such as soil type. Findings from this study can provide valuable insights for ecosystem modeling that aim to predict future carbon dynamics by integrating fine scale forest recovery conditions in GYE, in the face of climate change.

Whitebark is susceptible to multiple threats - climate change, white pine blister rust, mountain pine beetle, and fire exclusion - and it is suffering significant mortality range-wide, prompting the tree to be listed as 'globally endangered' by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and 'endangered' by the Canadian government. Conservation collections (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">in situ</i> and <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">ex situ</i>) are being initiated to preserve the genetic legacy of the species. Reliable, transferrable, and highly variable genetic markers are essential for quantifying the genetic profiles of seed collections relative to natural stands, and ensuring the completeness of conservation collections. We evaluated the use of hybridization-based target capture to enrich specific genomic regions from the 27 GB genome of whitebark pine, and to evaluate genetic variation across loci, trees, and geography. Probes were designed to capture 7,849 distinct genes, and screening was performed on 48 trees. Despite the inclusion of repetitive elements in the probe pool, the resulting dataset provided information on 4,452 genes and 32% of targeted positions (528,873 bp), and we were able to identify 12,390 segregating sites from 47 trees. Variations reveal strong geographic trends in heterozygosity and allelic richness, with trees from the southern Cascade and Sierra Range showing the greatest distinctiveness and differentiation.

3384,NA,"Campbell, J. L.; Shinneman, D. J.",Potential influence of wildfire in modulating climate-induced forest redistribution in a central Rocky Mountain landscape.,Ecological Processes,"Introduction: Climate change is expected to impose significant tension on the geographic distribution of tree species. Yet, tree species range shifts may be delayed by their long life spans, capacity to withstand long periods of physiological stress, and dispersal limitations. Wildfire could theoretically break this biological inertia by killing forest canopies and facilitating species redistribution under changing climate. We investigated the capacity of wildfire to modulate climate-induced tree redistribution across a montane landscape in the central Rocky Mountains under three climate scenarios (contemporary and two warmer future climates) and three wildfire scenarios (representing historical, suppressed, and future fire regimes). Methods: Distributions of four common tree species were projected over 90 years by pairing a climate niche model with a forest landscape simulation model that simulates species dispersal, establishment, and mortality under alternative disturbance regimes and climate scenarios. Results: Three species (Douglas-fir, lodgepole pine, subalpine fir) declined in abundance over time, due to climate-driven contraction in area suitable for establishment, while one species (ponderosa pine) was unable to exploit climate-driven expansion of area suitable for establishment. Increased fire frequency accelerated declines in area occupied by Douglas-fir, lodgepole pine, and subalpine fir, and it maintained local abundance but not range expansion of ponderosa pine. Conclusions: Wildfire may play a larger role in eliminating these conifer species along trailing edges of their distributions than facilitating establishment along leading edges, in part due to dispersal limitations and interspecific competition, and future populations may increasingly depend on persistence in locations unfavorable for their establishment.",2017,NA,Journal article,climate; climate change; fire frequency; forest fires; forests; geographical distribution; landscape; Rocky Mountains; wildfires,cabdirect,Yes,,,,,,

Dominant zooplankton taxa in three other temporary ponds and six permanent ponds were similar. Rotifer densities typically were lower in temporary ponds relative to those in permanent ponds, although Brachionus urceolaris was abundant shortly before the temporary ponds dried. Large volume loss was associated with large declines in total abundances of crustacean populations. Daphnia rosea was not present in temporary ponds following fall recharge. In deep-permanent ponds, copepods had slower developmental rates, smaller temporal changes in total abundances of crustacean populations and two additional large-bodied crustacean taxa were present relative to the characteristics of crustacean communities in shallow-permanent ponds.

The watersheds are the Upper Campbell and the Illecillewaet watersheds located in British Columbia. The first is a maritime watershed located on the eastern slopes of the Vancouver Island mountains; the second is located in the Selkirk Mountains in Eastern British Columbia. The Canadian Climate Centre General Circulation model has been used for the prediction of potential effects of climate change on meteorological parameters. In addition to the changes in the amounts of precipitation and temperature usually assumed in hydrologic climate change studies, other meteorological and climatic parameters also considered are the effect of climate on the spatial distribution of precipitation with elevation, as well as on cloud cover, glaciers, vegetation distribution, vegetation biomass production, and plant physiology. The results showed that the mean annual temperature in the two watersheds could increase by more than 3 degree C and the annual basinwide precipitation could increase by 7.5% in the Upper Campbell watershed and by about 17% in the Illecillewaet watershed. The higher temperatures changed some snowfall to rainfall and the extra precipitation was mainly in the form of rain. The increase of the CO sub(2) concentration caused stomata closure that reduced evapotranspiration. This effect was compensated by increased biomass in the Upper Campbell watershed, but not in the Illecillewaet watershed. These changes produced higher flows in winter and smaller flows in summer. The largest change in the hydrograph shape was in the Illecillewaet watershed where the mean annual maximum daily flow decreased by about 13% and its frequency was reduced. On the other hand, the mean annual runoff increased by 21%. In contrast, although the shape of the simulated annual hydrograph of the Upper Campbell watershed was not affected, magnitude and frequency of the annual maximum precipitation increased. Also, the mean annual runoff in the Upper Campbell watershed increased by 7.5%.

Andrews (Oregon), Coweeta (North Carolina), Hubbard Brook (New Hampshire), and Luquillo (Puerto Rico). Over 600 basin-years of daily streamflow records were examined from 18 basins that have not experienced human disturbances since at least the 1930s and in some cases much longer periods. This study used statistical methods to systematically evaluate the relationship between precipitation and streamflow at a range of spatial and temporal scales, and draw inferences from these relationships about the hydrologic behavior of the basins. Basins in this study had fundamentally different abilities to store and release moisture at a range of time and space scales. These different hydrologic regimes are the result of different types of forest canopies, snow, and soils in the study basins. Through their influences on interception and transpiration, forest canopies appear to play a very important role in the hydrologic regimes at Andrews and Luquillo, but at Coweeta and Hubbard Brook, the current deciduous forest plays a more limited although seasonally important role. Because of the timing of melt and its interaction with soils, seasonal snowpacks at Hubbard Brook and Andrews have quite different effects upon streamflow and vegetation water use. A variety of water flowpath types in soil, from macropore flow to long flowpaths in deep soils or fractured bedrock, appear to operate at the four sites. Hydrologic regimes may help predict the temporal scales of biogeochemical cycling and stream ecological processes, as well as the magnitude and timing of hydrologic response to disturbance and climate change in headwater basins.",2001,"Puerto Rico , Rainfall-runoff Relationships , USA, New Hampshire , USA, North Carolina , USA, Oregon",Scholarly Journals,"Puerto Rico , Rainfall-runoff Relationships , USA, New Hampshire , USA, North Carolina , USA, Oregon",proquest,Yes,,,,,,

We used dendroecological methods to study the effects of climatic variability on radial growth of a subalpine conifer, mountain hemlock (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Tsuga mertensiana</i>). Tree-ring chronologies were developed for 31 sites, spanning the latitudinal and elevational ranges of mountain hemlock in the Pacific Northwest. Factor analysis was used to identify common patterns of interannual growth variability among the chronologies, and correlation and regression analyses were used to identify climatic factors associated with that variability. Factor analysis identified three common growth patterns, representing groups of sites with different climate-growth relationships. At high-elevation and midrange sites in Washington and northern Oregon, growth was negatively correlated with spring snowpack depth, and positively correlated with growth-year summer temperature and the winter Pacific Decadal Oscillation index (PDO). In southern Oregon, growth was negatively correlated with spring snowpack depth and previous summer temperature, and positively correlated with previous summer precipitation. At the low-elevation sites, growth was mostly insensitive to annual climatic variability but displayed sensitivity to decadal variability in the PDO opposite to that found at high-elevation sites. Mountain hemlock growth appears to be limited by late snowmelt, short growing seasons, and cool summer temperatures throughout much of its range in the Pacific Northwest. Earlier snowmelt, higher summer temperatures, and lower summer precipitation in southern Oregon produce conditions under which growth is limited by summer temperature and/or soil water availability.

Trends during the 20th century in annually averaged temperature (0.7 degree C-0.9 degree C) and precipitation (13%-38%) exceed the global averages. Largest warming rates occurred in the maritime zone and in winter and at lower elevations in all zones, and smallest warming rates occurred in autumn and in the Rockies. Largest increases in precipitation (upwards of 60% per century) were observed in the dry areas in northeast Washington and south central British Columbia. Increases in precipitation were largest in spring, but were also large in summer in the central and Rocky Mountain climatic zones. These trends have already had profound impacts on streamflow and on certain plant species in the region (Cayan et al. 2001), and other important impacts remain to be discovered.

Part II: Mesoscale ENSO anomalies.,Journal of Climate,"The hydroclimate of the western United States is influenced by strong interannual variability of atmospheric circulation, much of which is associated with the El Ni������o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Precipitation anomalies during ENSO often show opposite and spatially coherent dry and wet patterns in the Northwest and California or vice versa. The role of orography in establishing mesoscale ENSO anomalies in the western United States is examined based on observed precipitation and temperature data at 1/8������ spatial resolution and a regional climate simulation at 40-km spatial resolution. Results show that during El Ni������o or La Ni������a winters, strong precipitation anomalies are found in northern California, along the southern California coast, and in the northwest mountains such as the Olympic Mountains, the Cascades, and the northern Rockies. These spatial features, which are strongly affected by topography, are surprisingly well reproduced by the regional climate simulation. A spatial feature investigated further is the positive-negative-positive precipitation anomaly found during El Ni������o years in the Olympic Mountains, and on the west side and east side of the Cascades in both observations and regional simulation. Observed streamflows of river basins located in those areas are found to be consistent with the precipitation anomalies. The spatial distribution of the precipitation anomalies is investigated by relating flow direction and moisture to the orientation of mountains and orographic precipitation. On the west side of the north-south-oriented Cascade Range, the increase in atmospheric moisture is not enough to compensate for the loss of orographic precipitation associated with a change in flow direction toward the southwest during El Ni������o years. In California, both the increase in atmospheric moisture and shift in wind direction toward the southwest enhance precipitation along the Sierra, which is oriented northwest to southeast.

Leading rotated principal component (RPC) scores of a gridded tree-ring reconstruction of the PDSI from 1525 to 1975 are significantly correlated with indices representing large-scale climate variations from the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. RPC1 (31%) is related to the influence of North Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) variations, indexed by the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). RPC2 (24%) is apparently related to North Atlantic SST variations, indexed by the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO). RPC3 (19%) is moderately correlated with a smoothed version of the Southern Oscillation Index. Consistent with recent studies of instrumental data, RPC1 (PDO) and RPC2 (AMO) explain a large part of the multidecadal hydrologic variability of the interior western United States. Western U.S. PDSI variability exhibits significant pentadecadal (and longer) oscillations in the epochs from circa 1525 to 1650 and 1850 to 1975, while bidecadal oscillations are prevalent in the middle epoch from circa 1650 to 1850. The changes in spectral characteristics of western U.S. PDSI were related to similar changes in the PDO (and therefore in RPC1). In contrast, RPC2 had a regular periodicity of 51 years for the past ���������500 years.

At local scales, aspen loss has been attributed to fire exclusion, ungulate herbivory, and climate change. Understanding the links between biophysical setting and aspen presence, growth, and dynamics is necessary to develop a large-scale perspective on aspen dynamics.

Palmer's Drought Severity Index (PDSI) is strongly related to burned area at both regional and subregional scales. In the southern Interior West, PDSI is most strongly related to yearly burned area during warm-phase AMO, while for the same period no significant relationships exist between PDSI and burned area in the central Interior West. During cool-phase PDO, interannual climate has little influence on burned area in either the northern or the central Interior West. The opposite is true for the southern Interior West and the eastern slope of the Colorado Rockies using the Southern Oscillation Index and PDSI, respectively. The western slope of the Colorado Rockies is the only climate division or region in which burned area is not related to preceding PDSI. During warm-phase PDO, current PDSI explains 67% of the interannual variance in burned area on the western slope.

All GCM simulations were extracted from the standardized set of runs created for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Analysis of model runs for the 20th century (20c3m) simulations revealed that the direct output of wind statistics from these models is of relatively poor quality compared with observations at airport weather stations within each state. When the GCM output was statistically downscaled, the resulting estimates of current climate wind statistics are substantially better. Furthermore, in looking at the GCM wind statistics for two IPCC future climate scenarios from the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES A1B and A2), there was significant disagreement in the direct model output from the four GCMs. When statistical downscaling was applied to the future climate simulations, a more coherent story unfolded related to the likely impact of climate change on the region's wind power resource. Specifically, the results suggest that summertime wind speeds in the Northwest may decrease by 5-10%, while wintertime wind speeds may decrease by relatively little, or possibly increase slightly. When these wind statistics are projected to typical turbine hub heights and nominal wind turbine power curves are applied, the impact of the climate change scenarios on wind power may be as high as a 40% reduction in summertime generation potential.",2008,NA,Journal article,climate; climate change; energy; renewable energy; simulation models; wind; wind power; wind speed,cabdirect,Yes,,,,,,

Harvest rates in non-federal large-diameter forests (LDF) either decreased or remained stable at relatively high rates following the NWFP, meaning that harvest reductions on federal forests, which cover half of the region, resulted in a significant regional drop in the loss of LDF to harvest. However, increased losses of LDF to fire outweighed reductions in LDF harvest across large areas of the region.

Previous studies have shown that the snow hydrology of the western United States has changed in the second half of the twentieth century. Such changes manifest themselves in the form of more rain and less snow, in reductions in the snow water contents, and in earlier snowmelt and associated advances in streamflow ""center"" timing (the day in the ""water-year"" on average when half the water-year flow at a point has passed). However, with one exception over a more limited domain, no other study has attempted to formally attribute these changes to anthropogenic increases of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Using the observations together with a set of global climate model simulations and a hydrologic model (applied to three major hydrological regions of the western United States - the California region, the upper Colorado River basin, and the Columbia River basin), it is found that the observed trends toward earlier ""center"" timing of snowmelt-driven streamflows in the western United States since 1950 are detectably different from natural variability (significant at the <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">p</i>&lt;0.05 level). Furthermore, the nonnatural parts of these changes can be attributed confidently to climate changes induced by anthropogenic greenhouse gases, aerosols, ozone, and land use.

For different species, current evidence supports establishment of the disjunction via an inland glacial refugium, via recent dispersal from the coast, or via a combination of both. In this study, the modern distributions of the coastal-disjunct vascular plants are analysed with respect to modern climate to examine how refugia and/or dispersal limitation control regional patterns in species richness. Location: North-west North America. Methods: The distributions of nine tree and 58 understorey species with a coastal-disjunct pattern were compiled on a 50-km grid. The relationship between species richness and an estimate of available moisture was calculated separately for formerly glaciated and unglaciated portions of the coastal and inland regions. Growth habit and dispersal mode were assessed as possible explanatory variables for species distributions. Results: Species richness shows a strong relationship to climate in coastal-unglaciated areas but no relationship to climate in inland-glaciated areas. In inland-glaciated areas, richness is <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">c.</i> 70% lower than that expected from climate. Species with animal-dispersed seeds occupy a larger portion of coastal and inland regions than species with less dispersal potential. Main conclusions: Modern patterns of diversity are consistent with both refugia and dispersal processes in establishing the coastal-disjunct pattern. The inland glacial refugium is marked by locally high diversity and several co-distributed endemics. In the inland-glaciated area, dispersal limitation has constrained diversity despite the nearby refugia. Onset of mesic climate within only the last 3000 years and the low dispersal capacity of many species in the refugium may explain this pattern.

We test the effect of combining modern pollen samples from multiple depositional environments on various pollen-based climate reconstruction methods using modern pollen samples from British Columbia, Canada and adjacent Washington, Montana, Idaho and Oregon states. This dataset includes samples from a number of depositional environments including soil and lacustrine sediments. Combining lacustrine and terrestrial (soil) samples increases root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP) for reconstructions of summer growing degree days when weighted-averaging partial-least-squares (WAPLS), weighted-averaging (WA) and the non-metric-multidimensional-scaling/generalized-additive-models (NMDS/GAM) are used but reduces RMSEP for randomForest, the modern analogue technique (MAT) and the Mixed method, although a slight increase occurs for MAT at the highest sample size. Summer precipitation reconstructions using MAT, randomForest and NMDS/GAM suffer from increased RMSEP when both lacustrine and terrestrial samples are used, but WA, WAPLS and the Mixed method show declines in RMSEP. These results indicate that researchers interested in using pollen databases to reconstruct climate variables need to consider the depositional environments of samples within the analytical dataset since pooled datasets can increase model error for some climate variables.

Presence and absence of the species and genetic variation within the species were projected into future climates provided by three General Circulation Models and two scenarios. Although the projections described pronounced impacts on the species and its populations, concurrence among the six projections pinpointed areas where the probability would be high that the future climate would be suitable for western larch. Concurrence among projections also was used to locate those sources of seed that should be best attuned genetically to future climates.

Part of the recent warming in the western United States has been attributed to anthropogenic climate change. This research seeks to answer the basic question of how declining streamflow, increasing temperatures, and fluctuation in precipitation have impacted water resource allocation in the Snake River Plain over the past 35 years (1971-2005). Understanding how changes in climatic attributes have historically impacted water allocation should help water managers better understand how projected climate change may influence allocation. Annual and monthly diversion trends from 62 locations in the Snake River Plain were compared to temperature and precipitation trends at 10 climate stations across the basin. We found a strong trend of declining annual surface water diversions across the study area. Of the 62 diversion points examined, 45 have highly significant decreasing annual diversion trends, while an additional 8 have significant decreasing trends. Despite the annual decline in surface water diversions, April diversions have increased at more than half of the diversion points, with 15 locations showing highly significant trends and an additional 17 showing significant increasing diversion trends. A comparison of diversions to the Surface Water Supply Index indicates that the decline in midseason and late season diversions is mostly caused by decreasing supply in the study period, while a comparison of diversions to Palmer's <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Z</i> index and the Standardized Precipitation Index indicates that early season diversions are highly correlated to early season moisture anomalies.",2011,NA,Journal article,climate; climate change; drought; flow; human activity; indexes; moisture; precipitation; research; rivers; soil water; stream flow; streams; surface water; temperature; variation; water allocation; water resources; water supply; watersheds,cabdirect,Yes,,,,,,

Recent work has shown a link between wolverine (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Gulo gulo</i>) habitat and persistent spring snow cover through 15 May, the approximate end of the wolverine's reproductive denning period. We modeled the distribution of snow cover within the Columbia, Upper Missouri, and Upper Colorado River Basins using a downscaled ensemble climate model. The ensemble model was based on the arithmetic mean of 10 global climate models (GCMs) that best fit historical climate trends and patterns within these three basins. Snow cover was estimated from resulting downscaled temperature and precipitation patterns using a hydrologic model. We bracketed our ensemble model predictions by analyzing warm (miroc 3.2) and cool (pcm1) downscaled GCMs. Because Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-based snow cover relationships were analyzed at much finer grain than downscaled GCM output, we conducted a second analysis based on MODIS-based snow cover that persisted through 29 May, simulating the onset of spring two weeks earlier in the year. Based on the downscaled ensemble model, 67% of predicted spring snow cover will persist within the study area through 2030-2059, and 37% through 2070-2099. Estimated snow cover for the ensemble model during the period 2070-2099 was similar to persistent MODIS snow cover through 29 May.

The importance of winter snow accumulation to upland ecosystems is not as clearly defined. This study investigates the relative contribution of winter precipitation to upland spring and summer soil moisture storage and availability in a semi-arid mountainous watershed. At this site, coarse soil textures and shallow soil depths limit soil storage capacity to 6-16 cm. Winter precipitation exceeds soil storage capacity by 2.5 times. Accordingly, soil moisture profiles at most locations in the watershed reach field capacity in early winter. With soil storage near capacity, water released by snowmelt primarily contributes to deep drainage and makes a limited contribution to the soil moisture reservoir. Water that is retained by the soil after the snowpack melts is lost to evapotranspiration in as little as 10 days. In contrast, spring precipitation extends moist soil conditions by up to 90 days into the warm season, when ecological water demand is highest. These field observations suggest that changes in spring precipitation, not winter snowpack, may have the greater impact on upland ecosystems in this environment. Furthermore, because winter precipitation is in excess compared to the soil storage capacity, soil moisture availability may be fairly insensitive to climate change-induced transitions from snow to rain.",2011,NA,Journal article,climate change; ecosystems; precipitation; snow; soil depth; soil texture; soil water content; upland areas; vegetation; water availability,cabdirect,Yes,,,,,,

Hydrologic model calibration in glacier-fed catchments is difficult because errors in modelling snow accumulation can be offset by compensating errors in glacier melt. This problem is particularly severe in catchments with modest glacier cover, where goodness-of-fit statistics such as the Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency may not be highly sensitive to the streamflow variance associated with glacier melt. While glacier mass balance measurements can be used to aid model calibration, they are absent for most catchments. We introduce the use of glacier volume change determined from repeated glacier mapping in a guided GLUE (generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation) procedure to calibrate a hydrologic model. This approach is applied to the Mica basin in the Canadian portion of the Columbia River Basin using the HBV-EC hydrologic model. Use of glacier volume change in the calibration procedure effectively reduced parameter uncertainty and helped to ensure that the model was accurately predicting glacier mass balance as well as streamflow. The seasonal and interannual variations in glacier melt contributions were assessed by running the calibrated model with historic glacier cover and also after converting all glacierized areas to alpine land cover in the model setup. Sensitivity of modelled streamflow to historic changes in glacier cover and to projected glacier changes for a climate warming scenario was assessed by comparing simulations using static glacier cover to simulations that accommodated dynamic changes in glacier area. Although glaciers in the Mica basin only cover 5% of the watershed, glacier ice melt contributes up to 25% and 35% of streamflow in August and September, respectively. The mean annual contribution of ice melt to total streamflow varied between 3 and 9% and averaged 6%. Glacier ice melt is particularly important during warm, dry summers following winters with low snow accumulation and early snowpack depletion. Although the sensitivity of streamflow to historic glacier area changes is small and within parameter uncertainties, our results suggest that glacier area changes have to be accounted for in future projections of late summer streamflow.

Climate change studies based on species distribution models (SDMs) have been criticized because they extend correlational relationships beyond the observed data. Here, we compared conventional climate-based SDMs against ecohydrological SDMs that include information from process-based simulations of water balance. We examined the current and future distribution of <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Artemisia tridentata</i> (big sagebrush) representing sagebrush ecosystems, which are widespread in semiarid western North America. For each approach, we calculated ensemble models from nine SDM methods and tested accuracy of each SDM with a null distribution. Climatic conditions included current conditions for 1970-1999 and two IPCC projections B1 and A2 for 2070-2099. Ecohydrological conditions were assessed by simulating soil water balance with SOILWAT, a daily time-step, multiple layer, mechanistic, soil water model. Under current conditions, both climatic and ecohydrological SDM approaches produced comparable sagebrush distributions. Overall, sagebrush distribution is forecasted to decrease, with larger decreases under the A2 than under the B1 scenario and strong decreases in the southern part of the range. Increases were forecasted in the northern parts and at higher elevations. Both SDM approaches produced accurate predictions. However, the ecohydrological SDM approach was slightly less accurate than climatic SDMs (-1% in AUC, -4% in Kappa and TSS) and predicted a higher number of habitat patches than observed in the input data. Future predictions of ecohydrological SDMs included an increased number of habitat patches whereas climatic SDMs predicted a decrease. This difference is important for understanding landscape-scale patterns of sagebrush ecosystems and management of sagebrush obligate species for future conditions. Several mechanisms can explain the diverging forecasts; however, we need better insights into the consequences of different datasets for SDMs and how these affect our understanding of future trajectories.",2012,NA,Journal article,hydrology; models; soil water balance,cabdirect,Yes,,,,,,

There is strong evidence that climate change has contributed to the extent and severity of recent outbreaks. Scientists are interested in quantifying relationships between bark beetle population dynamics and trends in climate. Process models that simulate climate suitability for mountain pine beetle outbreaks have advanced our understanding of beetle population dynamics; however, there are few studies that have assessed their accuracy across multiple outbreaks or at larger spatial scales. This study used the observed number of trees killed by mountain pine beetles per square kilometer in Oregon and Washington, USA, over the past three decades to quantify and assess the influence of climate and weather variables on beetle activity over longer time periods and larger scales than previously studied. Influences of temperature and precipitation in addition to process model output variables were assessed at annual and climatological time scales. The statistical analysis showed that new attacks are more likely to occur at locations with climatological mean August temperatures &gt;15������C.

During the last century in the western United States, significant reductions in snowpack and earlier snowmelt have led to an increase in the fraction of annual streamflow during winter and a decline in the summer. Previous work has identified elevation as it relates to snowpack dynamics as the primary control on streamflow sensitivity to warming. But along with changes in the timing of snowpack accumulation and melt, summer streamflows are also sensitive to intrinsic, geologically mediated differences in the efficiency of landscapes in transforming recharge (either as rain or snow) into discharge; we term this latter factor drainage efficiency. Here we explore the conjunction of drainage efficiency and snowpack dynamics in interpreting retrospective trends in summer streamflow during 1950-2010 using daily streamflow from 81 watersheds across the western United States.

This conjunctive analysis indicates that summer streamflows in watersheds that drain slowly from deep groundwater and receive precipitation as snow are most sensitive to climate warming. During the spring, however, watersheds that drain rapidly and receive precipitation as snow are most sensitive to climate warming. Our results indicate that not all trends in western United States are associated with changes in snowpack dynamics; we observe declining streamflow in late fall and winter in rain-dominated watersheds as well.

In the Lemhi Basin, Idaho (U.S.A.), water diversion causes changes in streamflow, and climate change will further affect streamflow and temperature.

We examined the potential effects of water diversion and climate change on juvenile Chinook salmon (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Oncorhynchus tshawytscha</i>), a species listed as threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA). To examine the effects for juvenile survival, we created a model relating 19 years of juvenile survival data to streamflow and temperature and found spring streamflow and summer temperature were good predictors of juvenile survival. We used these models to project juvenile survival for 15 diversion and climate-change scenarios. Projected survival was 42-58% lower when streamflows were diverted than when streamflows were undiverted. For diverted streamflows, 2040 climate-change scenarios (ECHO-G and CGCM3.1 T47) resulted in an additional 11-39% decrease in survival. We also created models relating habitat carrying capacity to streamflow and made projections for diversion and climate-change scenarios. Habitat carrying capacity estimated for diverted streamflows was 17-58% lower than for undiverted streamflows.

This dilemma may be pronounced at range peripheries where rates of change are accelerated and ongoing invasions often are perceived as threats to local ecosystems. We provide an example from City of Rocks National Reserve (CIRO) in southern Idaho, positioned at the northern range periphery of pinyon-juniper (P-J) woodland. Reserve managers are concerned about P-J woodland encroachment into adjacent sagebrush steppe, but the rates and biophysical variability of encroachment are not well documented and management options are not well understood. We quantified the rate and extent of woodland change between 1950 and 2009 based on a random sample of aerial photo interpretation plots distributed across biophysical gradients. Our study revealed that woodland cover remained at approximately 20% of the study area over the 59-year period. In the absence of disturbance, P-J woodlands exhibited the highest rate of increase among vegetation types at 0.37% yr<sup xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">-1</sup>. Overall, late-successional P-J stands increased in area by over 100% through the process of densification (infilling). However, wildfires during the period resulted in a net decrease of woody evergreen vegetation, particularly among early and mid-successional P-J stands. Elevated wildfire risk associated with expanding novel annual grasslands and drought is likely to continue to be a fundamental driver of change in CIRO woodlands. Because P-J woodlands contribute to regional biodiversity and may contract at trailing edges with global warming, CIRO may become important to P-J woodland conservation in the future.

We applied these results to output from the variable infiltration capacity hydrologic model, which predicted hydrology under a baseline scenario (+0������C) and a range of warming scenarios expected with climate change (+1, +2 or +3������C). When compared to the baseline, the results indicated that earlier peakflows predicted under warming scenarios may lead to earlier initiation of biofilm growth. This may increase biofilm AFDM during the summer by up to 103% (������29) in the +3������C scenario. Moreover, interannual variability of AFDM was predicted to increase up to 300%.

Because hydrologic change may alter the temporal dynamics of biofilm growth, it may affect the seasonal dynamics of biofilm quality (i.e. chl-<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">a</i>-to-AFDM ratio). The results indicated that hydrologic shifts may increase biofilm quality during the spring, but may decrease it during the summer. Thus, we provide evidence that predicted hydrologic shifts in snowmelt-dominated streams may alter the quantity and quality of an important basal resource.

Simulations were evaluated using point-based measurements of SWE, precipitation, and temperature that showed Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency coefficients of 0.83, 0.97, and 0.80, respectively. Spatial accuracy was shown to be 82% using snow cover extent from the Landsat Thematic Mapper.

Temperature increases are the primary driver of diminished snowpack accumulation, however variability in precipitation produce discernible changes in the timing and volumetric storage of snowpack. The results of this study are regionally relevant as melt water from the MRB's snowpack provides critical water supply for agriculture, ecosystems, and municipalities throughout the region especially in summer when water demand is high.

This large-scale implementation of the LAS method consisted of 8673 km of flight lines, along which 4653 geo-tagged, oblique aerial photos were captured at the catchment level (a subset of 12-digit USGS hydrologic units) and geographic information system (GIS) processed. The Mountain Pine Beetle-caused Mortality Rating System, a landscape-scale classification system designed specifically to measure the cumulative effects of recent and older MPB attacks on whitebark pine, was used to classify mortality with a rating from 0 to 6 based on the amount of red (recent attack) and gray (old attack) trees visible. The approach achieved a photo inventory of 79% of the GYE whitebark pine distribution. For the remaining 21%, mortality levels were estimated based on an interpolated surface. Results that combine the photo-inventoried and interpolated mortality indicate that nearly half (46%) of the GYE whitebark pine distribution showed severe mortality (3-4 or 5.3-5.4 rating), 36% showed moderate mortality (2-2.9 rating), 13% showed low mortality (1-1.9 rating), and 5% showed trace levels of mortality (0-0.9). These results reveal that the proliferation of MPB in the subalpine zone of the GYE due to climate warming has led to whitebark pine mortality that is more severe and widespread than indicated from either previous modeling research or USDA Forest Service Aerial Detection surveys. Sixteen of the 22 major mountain ranges of the GYE have experienced widespread moderate-to-severe mortality. The majority of catchments in the other six mountain ranges show low-to-moderate mortality.

Recent studies have illustrated that changes in the snow/rainfall apportionments and snow accumulation and melt patterns may occur as a consequence of changes in climate in the region. In order to understand how these changes may affect the snow regimes of the region, the current characteristics of the snow accumulation and melt patterns must be identified. Here we characterize the snow water equivalent (SWE) curve formed by the daily SWE values at 766 snow pillow stations in the Western United States, focusing on several metrics of the yearly SWE curves and the relationships between the different metrics. The metrics are the initial snow accumulation and snow disappearance dates, the peak snow accumulation and date of peak, the length of the snow accumulation season, the length of the snowmelt season, and the snow accumulation and snowmelt slopes. Three snow regimes emerge from these results: a maritime, an intermountain, and a continental regime. The maritime regime is characterized by higher maximum snow accumulations reaching 300 cm and shorter accumulation periods of less than 220 days. Conversely, the continental regime is characterized by lower maximum accumulations below 200 cm and longer accumulation periods reaching over 260 days. The intermountain regime lies in between. The regions that show the characteristics of the maritime regime include the Cascade Mountains, the Klamath Mountains, and the Sierra Nevada Mountains. The intermountain regime includes the Eastern Cascades slopes and foothills, the Blue Mountains, Northern and Central basins and ranges, the Columbia Mountains/Northern Rockies, the Idaho Batholith, and the Canadian Rockies. Lastly, the continental regime includes the Middle and Southern Rockies, and the Wasatch and Uinta Mountains.

Results: Differences between occurrence probabilities for seedlings and adults were greatest for montane, as opposed to subalpine, species and along range margins, especially in the southern and western portions of the study area. Climate envelope boundaries of seedlings differed from adult trees most frequently in montane species and often suggested range contractions or range shifts, as opposed to range expansion.

Regional context, notably the spatial complexity of climatic gradients, may influence species migration potential. While high-elevation species may benefit from steep climate gradients in mountain regions, their persistence may be threatened by limited suitable habitat as land area decreases with elevation. To untangle these apparently contradictory predictions for mountainous regions, we evaluated the climatic suitability of four coniferous forest tree species of the western United States based on species distribution modeling (SDM) and examined changes in climatically suitable areas under predicted climate change. We used forest structural information relating to tree species dominance, productivity, and demography from an extensive forest inventory system to assess the strength of inferences made with a SDM approach. We found that tree species dominance, productivity, and recruitment were highest where climatic suitability (i.e., probability of species occurrence under certain climate conditions) was high, supporting the use of predicted climatic suitability in examining species risk to climate change. By predicting changes in climatic suitability over the next century, we found that climatic suitability will likely decline, both in areas currently occupied by each tree species and in nearby unoccupied areas to which species might migrate in the future. These trends were most dramatic for high elevation species. Climatic changes predicted over the next century will dramatically reduce climatically suitable areas for high-elevation tree species while a lower elevation species, <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Pinus ponderosa</i>, will be well positioned to shift upslope across the region.

Outbreaks of the western spruce budworm often occur synchronously over broad regions and lead to widespread loss of leaf area and decrease in growth rates in affected stands. In spite of the ecological and economic significance of this defoliator, the mechanisms controlling this species' population dynamics are still not fully understood. We used dendrochronological methods to reconstruct three centuries of western spruce budworm outbreaks at thirteen sites along a transect running from central Oregon to western Montana and compared the outbreak reconstructions with regional drought history. The reconstructions reveal repeated western spruce budworm outbreaks that sometimes persisted more than a decade and were significantly synchronous among sites. Synchrony was higher in the second half of the record, possibly due to changes in forest composition and structure brought about by land use practices. Across stands and regions, there was a moderately strong relationship between initiation of synchronous outbreaks and periods of transitional climate conditions in which moisture availability was below average prior to outbreak initiation, but above average in the first few years of an outbreak. There was a weak relationship between cessation of outbreaks and one or more years of high moisture availability. Outbreaks tended to occur near the end of droughts. The association between climatic variability and outbreak dynamics observed across this transect indicates that climate is an important driver of western spruce budworm outbreaks. Other factors that we did not test, but that may influence outbreak dynamics include stand structure, forest composition, predation, and phenological synchrony between larvae and host trees. Future changes in western spruce budworm outbreak dynamics will be determined by a combination of changing climate, interactions with other disturbance agents, and changing forest composition and structure.

To simulate the hydrological processes in the watershed, the physically based hydrological model WaSiM (Water Balance Simulation Model) is applied.

The impacts of the wildfires are evident in observed runoff data. They also result in a distinct decrease in model efficiency if not considered via an adapted model parameterization, taking into account the modified land cover characteristics for the burned area.

To address this knowledge gap, we superimposed areas burned on areas infested by MPBs for the three peak years of wildfire activity since 2002 across the western United States. Here, we show that the observed effect of MPB infestation on the area burned in years of extreme fire appears negligible at broad spatial extents. Contrary to the expectation of increased wildfire activity in recently infested red-stage stands, we found no difference between observed area and expected area burned in red-stage or subsequent gray-stage stands during three peak years of wildfire activity, which account for 46% of area burned during the 2002-2013 period. Although MPB infestation and fire activity both independently increased in conjunction with recent warming, our results demonstrate that the annual area burned in the western United States has not increased in direct response to bark beetle activity.

However, climate-fire research has primarily focused on understanding drivers of fire frequency and area burned, largely due to scale mismatches and limited data availability. Recent datasets, however, allow for the investigation of climate influences on ecological patch metrics across broad regions independent of area burned and at finer scale. One area of particular interest is the distribution of fire refugia within wildfire perimeters. Although much recent research emphasis has been placed on high-severity patches within wildfires, unburned and low-severity patches provide critical remnant habitat and serve as seed sources to initiate colonization and succession in recently burned landscapes. These patches of persistence also may yield insights into approaches for developing fire-resilient landscapes by forest managers and communities seeking to reduce wildfire hazard. Here, we present results showing no decline in proportion of persistent patches in three study areas surrounding National Parks in the western United States, even as research and anecdotal information suggests that fires have become larger and more severe. We also show climate linkages to metrics of persistence that echo previous findings in climate-fire research, and we introduce a framework for addressing global change impacts on forest pattern more broadly. Specifically, we discuss the interactions of multiple drivers at landscape scales and the need to disaggregate relative influences using mixed methods that can address both social and ecological phenomenon.",2015,NA,Journal article; Conference paper,climate; climate change; environmental impact; forest fires; landscape; national parks; wildfires,cabdirect,Yes,,,,,,

In the first, the top 150 precipitation events at stations located within six regions in the IMW were identified, and then back trajectories were initiated at 6-h intervals on those days at the four Climate Forecast System Reanalysis grid points nearest the stations. The second method identified the leading patterns of integrated water vapor transport (IVT) using the three leading empirical orthogonal functions of IVT over land that were first normalized by the local standard deviation. The top 1% of the associated 6-hourly time series was used to construct composites of IVT, atmospheric circulation, and precipitation. The results from both methods indicate that moisture originating from the Pacific that leads to extreme precipitation in the IMW during winter takes distinct pathways and is influenced by gaps in the Cascades (Oregon-Washington), the Sierra Nevada (California), and Peninsular Ranges (from Southern California through Baja California). The moisture transported along these routes appears to be the primary source for heavy precipitation for the mountain ranges in the IMW.

Variability in snow cover within mountainous regions of the Pacific Northwest, USA is attributable to a combination of anthropogenic climate change and climate oscillations. However, snow covered areas can be heterogeneous and patchy, requiring more detailed mapping of snow trends to understand their potential influences on montane forests. We used standard daily MODIS snow products (MOD10A1.5) to investigate the 15-year record (2000-2014) of snow cover in the predominant forest ecotone of the Oregon Western Cascades. We modeled the ecotone using field data from the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest, and only considered forested MODIS Terra pixels located within the mapped ecotone of a five-county region. Three snow cover metrics were developed using both binary and fractional snow cover data: mean ecotone snow cover percent, number of snow covered days during the melt season, and day of snow disappearance. Snow cover and depletion dates exhibited large interannual variability and no significant linear trends. This variability is likely influenced by the preceding wintertime states of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the El Ni������o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which tend to covary. We improve and generalize existing methods for power analysis of trend estimation and quantify the number of uninterrupted observations of the snow metrics that would be needed to distinguish trends of different magnitudes from noise variance, taking possible autocorrelation into account.

Although some fire regime characteristics (e.g., area burned and fire season length) are relatively well-studied in the context of a changing climate, fire severity has received less attention. In this study, we used observed data from 1984 to 2012 for the western United States (US) to build a statistical model of fire severity as a function of climate.

As such, our predictions are best interpreted as a <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">potential</i> reduction in fire severity, a potential that may not be realized due human-induced disequilibrium between plant communities and climate. Consequently, to realize the reductions in fire severity predicted in this study, land managers in the western US could facilitate the transition of plant communities towards a state of equilibrium with the emerging climate through means such as active restoration treatments (e.g., mechanical thinning and prescribed fire) and passive restoration strategies like managed natural fire (under suitable weather conditions). Resisting changes in vegetation composition and fuel load via activities such as aggressive fire suppression will amplify disequilibrium conditions and will likely result in increased fire severity in future decades because fuel loads will increase as the climate warms and fire danger becomes more extreme.

We expected these vegetation types to burn proportionally less than the entire ecoregion, reflecting higher fuel moisture and longer historical fire rotations. In four of eight ecoregions, the proportion of area burned in subalpine parkland (3%-8%) was greater than the proportion of area burned in the entire ecoregion (2%-7%). In contrast, in all but one ecoregion, a small proportion (���������4%) of the alpine vegetation burned.

Here we present a conceptual framework for incorporating spatial variability in natural resource vulnerability to climate change in a regional-scale assessment. The framework was implemented in the first regional-scale vulnerability assessment conducted by the US Forest Service. During this assessment, five subregional workshops were held to capture variability in vulnerability and to develop adaptation tactics. At each workshop, participants answered a questionnaire to: (1) identify species, resources, or other information missing from the regional assessment, and (2) describe subregional vulnerability to climate change. Workshop participants divided into six resource groups; here we focus on wildlife resources. Participants identified information missing from the regional assessment and multiple instances of subregional variability in climate change vulnerability. We provide recommendations for improving the process of capturing subregional variability in a regional vulnerability assessment. We propose a revised conceptual framework structured around pathways of climate influence, each with separate rankings for exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. These revisions allow for a quantitative ranking of species, pathways, exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity across subregions. Rankings can be used to direct the development and implementation of future regional research and monitoring programs.

At the first-order watershed scale, changes in evaporative demand, transpiration, and runoff will also occur. Previous modelling studies of the effect of increased carbon dioxide on the water budgets of watersheds have been single-factor exercises where a single parameter representing stomatal conductance was reached and the results noted. A comprehensive ecosystem model (SPURS, Simulation of Production and Utilization of Rangelands) was used to examine the consequences of changes in precipitation, temperature and carbon dioxide-induced plant function characteristics on small-basin runoff. Three watersheds in Colorado, Idaho and Arizona, USA were studied. It was concluded that for arid and semi-arid watersheds of the western United States, there would be little change or an actual decrease in surface runoff because of the increased carbon dioxide and climatic change. This was due to the decrease in precipitation imposed on the model simulations. Implementing stomatal closure on the model did not increase runoff from the watersheds when temperatures were increased and precipitation decreased.",1994,NA,Journal article,arid zones; climate; climate change; models; runoff; soil water balance,cabdirect,Yes,,,,,,

Paleoecological and contemporary ecological data in forest ecosystems provided model parameterization and validation at broad spatial and temporal scales for tree growth, tree regeneration and treeline movement. For subalpine tree species, winter precipitation has a strong negative correlation with growth; this relationship is stronger at higher elevations and west-side sites (which have more precipitation). Temperature affects tree growth at some locations with respect to length of growing season (spring) and severity of drought at drier sites (summer). Furthermore, variable but predictable climate-growth relationships across elevation gradients suggest that tree species respond differently to climate at different locations, making a uniform response of these species to future climatic change unlikely. Multi-decadal variability in climate also affects ecosystem processes. Mountain hemlock growth at high-elevation sites is negatively correlated with winter snow depth and positively correlated with the winter Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) index. At low elevations, the reverse is true. Glacier mass balance and fire severity are also linked to PDO. Rapid establishment of trees in subalpine ecosystems during this century is increasing forest cover and reducing meadow cover at many subalpine locations in the western U.S.A. and precipitation (snow depth) is a critical variable regulating conifer expansion. Lastly, modeling potential future ecosystem conditions suggests that increased climatic variability will result in increasing forest fire size and frequency, and reduced net primary productivity in drier, east-side forest ecosystems. As additional empirical data and modeling output become available, we will improve our ability to predict the effects of climatic change across a broad range of climates and mountain ecosystems in the northwestern U.S.A.",2003,NA,Journal article; Conference paper,climate change; ecosystems; growth; models; mountain areas; palaeoecology; palaeontology; precipitation; regeneration; spatial variation; temperature; temporal variation; treelines,cabdirect,Yes,,,,,,

It is shown that El Nino (La Nina) episodes lead to significant negative (positive) streamflow anomalies in several subregions during the spring and/or summer months following the ENSO onset year. A simple composite analysis of streamflow for anomalous PNA years conditioned on non-ENSO years showed that the high phase of PNA could also produce an El Nino-like streamflow response over the region. In addition, the ENSO-streamflow relationship appears to be modulated by the interdecadal oscillation of the North Pacific (NP) climate as indexed by the PDO. The interaction between PDO and ENSO was found to be constructive when the two are in phase and destructive otherwise. The potential of using the three large-scale climate anomalies (ENSO, PNA and PDO) for long-range streamflow forecasting in SW Canada was assessed using a partial correlation analysis with the southern oscillation index (SOI), the PNA and PDO indices at lead times of up to 10 months. While partial correlations with all three indices were found to be statistically significant for several basins, the ENSO and PDO effects appear to be far more important than that of the PNA pattern. The winter season SOI, which is an indicator of the mature phase of ENSO, shows modest correlations with basins whose flow regimes are dominated by winter rain/spring snowmelt. On the other hand, the winter season PDO shows relatively strong correlations with basins originating in the Rocky Mountains, whose flow regimes are dominated by spring-summer snow/glacier melt. The modest SOI-streamflow relationships are partly attributed to nonlinearity induced by the interference from the extratropical sources of variability (i.e. PNA and PDO). Long-range streamflow forecasting strategies for this region should thus incorporate information from the three large-scale climate anomalies.",2006,NA,Journal article,climate; climate change; forecasting; stream flow,cabdirect,Yes,,,,,,

Year-to-year fluctuations in annual net aboveground phytomass accumulation (ANAPA) were considerable in response to varying climate during both periods. More importantly, an apparently significant increase in ANAPA was observed during the latter study period. However, this apparent increase may have been due to the unusually wet conditions of 1993. Throughout both study periods, ANAPA was even more positively correlated with species richness than with precipitation, although both influences were statistically significant. Aggregation of these data by plant growth forms showed that shrubs, particularly sagebrushes, have progressively increased their proportion relative to herbaceous understorey. This directional (successional) change in the proportional contributions of growth forms to ANAPA was probably due more to long-term absence of fire at these isolated locations than to any detectable climate change or lack of grazing.

We used historical aerial photographs and airborne and satellite imagery to delineate habitats (i.e., mature forest, regenerative forest, water, cobble) within the floodplain. We related changes in the distribution and size of these habitats to hydrologic disturbance and regional climate. Results show a relationship between changes in floodplain habitats and annual flood magnitude, as well as between hydrology and the cooling and warming phases of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). Large magnitude floods and greater frequency of moderate floods were associated with the cooling phases of the PDO, resulting in a floodplain environment dominated by extensive restructuring and regeneration of floodplain habitats. Conversely, warming phases of the PDO corresponded with decreases in magnitude, duration, and frequency of critical flows, creating a floodplain environment dominated by late successional vegetation and low levels of physical restructuring. Over the 60-year time series, habitat change was widespread throughout the floodplain, though the relative abundances of the habitats did not change greatly.

However, finer-scale species-level responses to environmental fluctuations may also provide an important bellwether of impending future community responses. Here we examined changes in abundance of butterfly species along a hydrological gradient of six montane meadow habitat types in response to drought. Our data collection began prior to the drought, and we were able to track changes for 11 years, of which eight were considered mild to extreme drought conditions. We separated the species into those that had an affinity for hydric vs. xeric habitats. We suspected that drought would favor species with xeric habitat affinities, but that there could be variations in species-level responses along the hydrological gradient. We also suspected that mesic meadows would be most sensitive to drought conditions. Temporal trajectories were modeled for both species groups (hydric vs. xeric affinity) and individual species. Abundances of species with affinity for xeric habitats increased in virtually all meadow types. Conversely, abundances of species with affinity for hydric habitats decreased, particularly in mesic and xeric meadows. Mesic meadows showed the most striking temporal abundance trajectory: Increasing abundances of species with xeric habitat affinity were offset by decreasing or stable abundances of species with hydric habitat affinity. The one counterintuitive finding was that, in some hydric meadows, species with affinity for hydric habitats increased. In these cases, we suspect that decreasing moisture conditions in hydric meadows actually <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">increased</i> habitat suitability because sites near the limit of moisture extremes for some species became more acceptable. Thus, species responses were relatively predictable based upon habitat affinity and habitat location along the hydrological gradient, and mesic meadows showed the highest potential for changes in community composition. The implications of these results are that longer-term changes due to drought could simplify community composition, resulting in prevalence of species tolerant to drying conditions and a loss of species associated with wetter conditions.

Although these currently are provided as national estimates by pool and year to meet greenhouse gas monitoring requirements, there is growing need to disaggregate these estimates to finer scales to enable strategic forest management and monitoring activities focused on various ecosystem services such as C storage enhancement. Through application of a nearest-neighbor imputation approach, spatially extant estimates of forest C density were developed for the conterminous U.S. using the U.S.'s annual forest inventory. Results suggest that an existing forest inventory plot imputation approach can be readily modified to provide raster maps of C density across a range of pools (e.g., live tree to soil organic carbon) and spatial scales (e.g., sub-county to biome). Comparisons among imputed maps indicate strong regional differences across C pools. The C density of pools closely related to detrital input (e.g., dead wood) is often highest in forests suffering from recent mortality events such as those in the northern Rocky Mountains (e.g., beetle infestations). In contrast, live tree carbon density is often highest on the highest quality forest sites such as those found in the Pacific Northwest. Validation results suggest strong agreement between the estimates produced from the forest inventory plots and those from the imputed maps, particularly when the C pool is closely associated with the imputation model (e.g., aboveground live biomass and live tree basal area), with weaker agreement for detrital pools (e.g., standing dead trees). Forest inventory imputed plot maps provide an efficient and flexible approach to monitoring diverse C pools at national (e.g., UNFCCC) and regional scales (e.g., Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation projects) while allowing timely incorporation of empirical data (e.g., annual forest inventory).",2013,NA,Journal article,air pollutants; air pollution; air quality; climate change; deforestation; ecosystem services; forest management; forests; greenhouse gases; mountain areas; Rocky Mountains,cabdirect,Yes,,,,,,

Fewer studies have addressed whether eco-evolutionary dynamics structure natural ecosystems. We investigated variation in the frequency of serotiny in lodgepole pine (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Pinus contorta</i>), a widespread species in which postfire seedling density and ecosystem structure are largely determined by serotiny. Serotiny, the retention of mature seeds in cones in a canopy seed bank, is thought to be an adaptation for stand-replacing fire, but less attention has been paid to the potential selective effects of seed predation on serotiny. We hypothesized that spatial variation in percentage serotiny in lodgepole pine forests results from an eco-evolutionary dynamic where the local level of serotiny depends on the relative strengths of conflicting directional selection from fire (favoring serotiny) and seed predation (favoring cones that open at maturity). We measured percentage serotiny, the abundance of American red squirrels (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Tamiasciurus hudsonicus</i>; the primary pre-dispersal seed predator of lodgepole pine), and several measures of forest structure in Yellowstone National Park, USA. Fire frequency strongly predicted the frequency of serotiny, a pattern that is well-supported in the literature. At sites with high fire frequency (return intervals of ���������135-185 years) where fire favors increased serotiny, squirrel abundance was negatively associated with serotiny, suggesting that selection from predation can overwhelm selection from fire when squirrels are abundant. At sites with low fire frequency (return intervals of ���������280-310 years), serotiny was nearly universally uncommon (&lt;10%). Finally, forest structure strongly predicted squirrel density independently of serotiny, and serotiny provided no additional explanatory power, suggesting that the correlation is caused by selection against serotiny exerted by squirrels, rather than squirrels responding to variation in percentage serotiny.",2013,NA,Journal article,canopy; climate; climate change; coniferous forests; ecology; ecosystems; effects; evolution; fire ecology; fires; forests; interactions; literature; national parks; natural enemies; pines; predation; predators; seed banks; seed predation; seedlings; seeds; spatial variation,cabdirect,Yes,,,,,,

In areas with more contiguous subalpine forests and less complex topography, the proportion and spatial aggregation of severely burned areas were more strongly correlated with fire size.

The magnitude of such change agents and the sensitivity of ecosystems to these agents vary among protected areas. Thus, there is a need to assess vulnerability across networks of protected areas to determine those most at risk and to lay the basis for developing effective adaptation strategies. We conducted an assessment of exposure of U.S. National Parks to climate and land use change and consequences for vegetation communities. We first defined park protected-area centered ecosystems (PACEs) based on ecological principles. We then drew on existing land use, invasive species, climate, and biome data sets and models to quantify exposure of PACEs from 1900 through 2100. Most PACEs experienced substantial change over the 20th century (&gt;740% average increase in housing density since 1940, 13% of vascular plants are presently nonnative, temperature increase of 1������C/100 yr since 1895 in 80% of PACEs), and projections suggest that many of these trends will continue at similar or increasingly greater rates (255% increase in housing density by 2100, temperature increase of 2.5������-4.5������C/100 yr, 30% of PACE areas may lose their current biomes by 2030).

Underlying these averages, exposure of individual park PACEs to change agents differ in important ways.

For example, pollinators may limit species' ranges if floral abundance or floral attractiveness is reduced at range margins, thus causing lower pollinator visitation and reduced reproductive output. METHODS: To test if pollinators influence the altitudinal distribution of <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Erythronium montanum</i> (Liliaceae) at Mount Rainier National Park, we asked whether (1) seed production in this species relies on pollinators, (2) seed production and pollen limitation is greatest at range limits, and (3) pollinator visitation rates (either overall or by individual taxonomic groups) reflect patterns of seed production and pollen limitation. RESULTS: From this three-year study, we established that this plant does rely on pollinators for fruit set and we found that pollen limitation trended toward being higher at the upper range limit in some years, but not consistently year to year. Insect visitation rates did not mirror spatial patterns of pollen limitation, but annually variable pollinator composition suggested differential importance of some pollinator taxonomic groups (specifically, bumblebees may be better pollinators than syrphid flies). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these results suggest that while pollinators are critical for the reproductive success of this high mountain wildflower, plant-pollinator interactions do not obviously drive the distribution of this species.

Transect studies revealed that the bands of small trees were consistently younger than adjacent forest stands of obvious fire origin, that they lacked any evidence of fire, and that the trees were progressively younger as they approached the meadow. Soils under the young trees generally were more similar to meadow soils than to coniferous forest soils.

Variation in slope and aspect affect the spatial variance in solar radiation incident on the ground, hence ground surface temperature, at the same elevation, same hourly 2 m air temperatures, and wind speeds. We illustrate visually how spatial effects and landscape heterogeneity make statistical descriptions of animal responses problematic, since multiple distributions of their responses to climate, topography, and vegetation on the landscape can yield the same descriptive statistics, especially at high (30 m) resolution.

H.",The influence of fire interval and serotiny on postfire lodgepole pine density in Yellowstone National Park.,Ecology,"The time interval between stand-replacing fires can influence patterns of initial postfire succession if the abundance of postfire propagules varies with prefire stand age. We examined the effect of fire interval on initial postfire lodgepole pine (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Pinus contorta</i> var. <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">latifolia</i> Engelm.) density in Yellowstone National Park (YNP) following the 1988 fires. We asked whether postfire propagule abundance, measured as prefire percent serotiny, varied with fire interval and could explain patterns in postfire succession. The response of lodgepole pine density to variation in fire interval was explained by spatial and temporal variation in prefire serotiny. At low elevations, postfire lodgepole pine recruitment correlated strongly with prefire percent serotiny, which varied nonlinearly with prefire stand age. As a result, postfire lodgepole pine densities varied nonlinearly with fire interval. In contrast, at high elevations serotiny was low, varied little with stand age and did not influence postfire lodgepole pine densities, although, fire interval was still a significant predictor of postfire densities. At high elevations, fire interval varied nonlinearly with postfire lodgepole densities, presumably due to the temporal variation in propagule abundance from open cones in adjacent unburned stands. Temporal variation in stand-level serotiny at low elevations was best explained by age of individual trees. Logistic regression indicated that trees expected to be serotinous had a low probability of exhibiting serotiny at a young age, with increasing probability as trees matured up to 140 yr. This increase in serotiny with tree age likely accounts for the initial increase in stand-level percent serotiny with stand age at low elevations. The spatial variation in serotiny was correlated with variation in historical fire regimes. Fire interval models derived from lower elevations in YNP indicate that fire occurred historically at 135-185-yr intervals, whereas at higher elevations fires occurred at 280-310-yr intervals. The spatial patterns of serotiny appear to have been influenced by variability in historical fire regimes across the Yellowstone landscape, which has conditioned contemporary successional responses to disturbance.",2003,NA,Journal article,climate change; ecological disturbance; fire ecology; landscape ecology; plant succession; population density; spatial variation; temporal variation; pines,cabdirect,Yes,,,,,,

E.",Quantifying relationships between bird and butterfly community shifts and environmental change.,Ecological Applications,"Quantifying the manner in which ecological communities respond during a time of decreasing precipitation is a first step in understanding how they will respond to longer-term climate change. Here we coupled analysis of interannual variability in remotely sensed data with analyses of bird and butterfly community changes in montane meadow communities of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Landsat satellite imagery was used to classify these meadows into six types along a hydrological gradient. The northern portion of the ecosystem, or Gallatin region, has smaller mean patch sizes separated by ridges of mountains, whereas the southern portion of the ecosystem, or Teton region, has much larger patches within the Jackson Hole valley. Both support a similar suite of butterfly and bird species. The Gallatin region showed more overall among-year variation in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) when meadow types were pooled within regions, perhaps because the patch sizes are smaller on average. Bird and butterfly communities showed significant relationships relative to meadow type and NDVI. We identified several key species that are tightly associated with specific meadow types along the hydrological gradient. Comparing taxonomic groups, fewer birds showed specific habitat affinities than butterflies, perhaps because birds are responding to differences in habitat structure among meadow types and using the landscape at a coarser scale than the butterflies. Comparing regions, the Teton region showed higher predictability of community assemblages as compared to the Gallatin region. The Gallatin region exhibited more significant temporal trends with respect to butterflies. Butterfly communities in wet meadows showed a distinctive shift along the hydrological gradient during a drought period (1997-2000). These results imply that the larger Teton meadows will show more predictable (i.e., static) species-habitat associations over the long term, but that the smaller Gallatin meadows may be an area that will exhibit the effects of global climate change faster.",2006,NA,Journal article,climate; climate change; communities; drought; ecology; ecosystems; effects; grasslands; hydrology; imagery; Landsat; meadows; mountains; plant communities; relationships; satellite imagery; taxonomy,cabdirect,Yes,,,,,,

Stand-replacing fires switch ecosystems to being a net source of carbon as decomposition exceeds photosynthesis - a short-term effect (years to decades) that may be important over the next century if fire frequency increases. Over the long term (many centuries), net carbon storage through a fire cycle is zero if stands replace themselves. Therefore, equilibrium response of landscape carbon storage to changes in fire frequency will depend on how stand age distribution changes, on the carbon storage of different stand ages, and on postfire regeneration. In a case study of Yellowstone National Park, equilibrium values of landscape carbon storage were resistant to large changes in fire frequency because these forests regenerate quickly, the current fire interval is very long, the most rapid changes in carbon storage occur in the first century, and carbon storage is similar for stands of different ages. The conversion of forest to meadow or to sparser forest can have a large impact on landscape carbon storage, and this process is likely to be important for many conifer forests.",2006,NA,Journal article,atmosphere; biological production; carbon; carbon cycle; carbon sequestration; climate change; coarse woody debris; coniferous forests; dead wood; fire behaviour; fire effects; forest fires; forest litter; forests; landscape; national parks; natural regeneration; photosynthesis; stand age; stand characteristics; wildfires; pines,cabdirect,Yes,,,,,,

The potential causes of willow decline include climate change, increased elk browsing coincident with the loss of an apex predator, the gray wolf, and an absence of habitat engineering by beavers. The goal of this study was to determine the spatial and temporal patterns of willow establishment through the 20th century and to identify causal processes. Sampled willows established from 1917 to 1999 and contained far fewer young individuals than was predicted from a modeled stable willow population, indicating reduced establishment during recent decades. Two hydrologically distinct willow establishment environments were identified: fine-grained beaver pond sediments and coarse-grained alluvium. Willows established on beaver pond sediment earlier in time, higher on floodplain surfaces, and farther from the current stream channel than did willows on alluvial sediment. Significant linear declines from the 1940s to the 1990s in alluvial willow establishment elevation and lateral distance from the stream channel resulted in a much reduced area of alluvial willow establishment. Willow establishment was not well correlated with climate-driven hydrologic variables, but the trends were consistent with the effects of stream channel incision initiated in ca. 1950, 20-30 years after beaver dam abandonment. Radiocarbon dates and floodplain stratigraphy indicate that stream incision of the present magnitude may be unprecedented in the past two millennia. We propose that hydrologic changes, stemming from competitive exclusion of beaver by elk overbrowsing, caused the landscape to transition from a historical beaver-pond and willow-mosaic state to its current alternative stable state where active beaver dams and many willow stands are absent. Because of hydrologic changes in streams, a rapid return to the historical state may not occur by reduction of elk browsing alone.

However, little is known about how variable climate, including drought, may influence belowground productivity (BNPP), which constitutes most of the annual primary production of grasslands. The objectives of this study were to (1) examine how a 3-year period of declining moisture, which began as climatically wet to average across Yellowstone National Park (YNP) and ended in drought, affected ANPP and BNPP in grasslands of YNP and (2) how herds of grazing ungulates, which were shown previously to stimulate grassland shoot and root growth in YNP, may have interacted with climatic conditions to influence grassland production. ANPP and 0-20 cm BNPP, representing the bulk of the root dynamics, were measured in grazed and ungrazed (fenced) grassland at nine sites ranging widely in elevation, soil conditions and plant production during the 3-year study. Results revealed that 0-20 cm BNPP was strongly influenced by drought (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">P</i>=0.0005) and declined from 1999 to 2001 among ungrazed and grazed grasslands by 39 and 49%, respectively.

In contrast, ANPP was unaffected by drought in either type of grassland. Thus, the effect of this drought in YNP was a large reduction in BNPP, which was a function of (1) a direct negative influence of increased moisture stress on root growth and (2) a weak interaction between drought and herbivory that led to a decline in the positive feedback from grazers to BNPP.

Grazing did not affect soil temperature, moisture, cotton cloth decomposition rates, soil bulk density, soil C and N concentrations, or soil C:N ratios. However, a large spatio-temporal variability in decomposition was observed: cotton cloth decomposition was positively related to soil moisture and soil C and N concentrations, and negatively to soil temperature. Highest decomposition rates were found in wetter slope bottom soils [season averages of decomposition given as rate of decomposition (cotton rotting rate=CRR)=23-26%] and lower rates in drier, hill-top soils (season averages, CRR=20%). Significantly higher decomposition rates were recorded in spring, early summer and early fall when soils were moist and cool (spring, CRR=25%; early summer, CRR=26%; fall, CRR=20%) compared to mid-summer (CRR=18%) when soils were dry and warm.

In this study we investigated historic changes in seasonal patterns of streamflows, by comparing mean monthly flows and analyzing cumulative hydrographs over the periods of record of about a century. We tested predictions of change due to winter and spring warming that would increase the proportion of rain versus snow, and alter snow accumulation and melt. We analyzed records from 14 free-flowing, snow-melt dominated rivers that drained relatively pristine parks and protected areas, thus avoiding the effects of river damming, flow regulation, or watershed development. The collective results indicated that: (1) winter flows (especially March) were often slightly increased, (2) spring run-off and (3) peak flows occurred earlier, and most substantially, (4) summer and early autumn flows (July-October) were considerably reduced. The greatest changes were observed for the rivers draining the east-slope of the Rocky Mountains toward the northern prairies and Hudson Bay, with late summer flow decline rates of about 0.2%/year. This would have considerable ecological impact since this is the warm and dry period when evaporative demand is maximal and reduced instream flows would reduce riparian groundwater recharge, imposing drought stress on floodplain forests. In combination with the decline in annual discharge, earlier peaks and reduced summer flows would provide chronic stress on riparian cottonwoods and willows and especially restrict seedling recruitment.

Analysis of 60-year records of daily streamflow from eight paired-basin experiments in the Pacific Northwest of the United States (Oregon) revealed that the conversion of old-growth forest to Douglas-fir plantations had a major effect on summer streamflow. Average daily streamflow in summer (July through September) in basins with 34- to 43-year-old plantations of Douglas-fir was 50% lower than streamflow from reference basins with 150- to 500-year-old forests dominated by Douglas-fir, western hemlock, and other conifers. Study plantations are comparable in terms of age class, treatments, and growth rates to managed forests in the region. Young Douglas-fir trees, which have higher sapwood area, higher sapflow per unit of sapwood area, higher concentration of leaf area in the upper canopy, and less ability to limit transpiration, appear to have higher rates of evapotranspiration than old trees of conifer species, especially during dry summers. Reduced summer streamflow in headwater basins with forest plantations may limit aquatic habitat and exacerbate stream warming, and it may also alter water yield and timing in much larger basins. Legacies of past forest management or extensive natural disturbances may be confounded with effects of climate change on streamflow in large river basins. Continued research is needed using long-term paired-basin studies and process studies to determine the effects of forest management on streamflow deficits in a variety of forest types and forest management systems.",2017,NA,Scholarly Journals,NA,proquest,Yes,,,,,,

It compared pros and cons of various research methods, identified research challenges and proposed future research priorities. Our synthesis shows that the relative hydrological effects of forest changes and climatic variability are largely dependent on their own change magnitudes and watershed characteristics. In some severely disturbed watersheds, impacts of forest changes or land use changes can be as important as those from climatic variability. This paper provides a brief review on eight selected research methods for this type of research. Because each method or technique has its own strengths and weaknesses, combining two or more methods is a more robust approach than using any single method alone. Future research priorities include conducting more case studies, refining research methods, and considering mechanism-based research using landscape ecology and geochemistry approaches.",2013,"forest change , climate variability , large watershed hydrology , relative contribution , research methods",Scholarly Journals,"forest change , climate variability , large watershed hydrology , relative contribution , research methods",proquest,Yes,,,,,,

W.","Rural Nevada and climate change: vulnerability, beliefs, and risk perception.",Risk Analysis,"In this article, we present the results of a study investigating the influence of vulnerability to climate change as a function of physical vulnerability, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity on climate change risk perception. In 2008/2009, we surveyed Nevada ranchers and farmers to assess their climate change-related beliefs, and risk perceptions, political orientations, and socioeconomic characteristics. Ranchers' and farmers' sensitivity to climate change was measured through estimating the proportion of their household income originating from highly scarce water-dependent agriculture to the total income. Adaptive capacity was measured as a combination of the Social Status Index and the Poverty Index. Utilizing water availability and use, and population distribution GIS databases; we assessed water resource vulnerability in Nevada by zip code as an indicator of physical vulnerability to climate change. We performed correlation tests and multiple regression analyses to examine the impact of vulnerability and its three distinct components on risk perception. We find that vulnerability is not a significant determinant of risk perception. Physical vulnerability alone also does not impact risk perception. Both sensitivity and adaptive capacity increase risk perception. While age is not a significant determinant of it, gender plays an important role in shaping risk perception. Yet, general beliefs such as political orientations and climate change-specific beliefs such as believing in the anthropogenic causes of climate change and connecting the locally observed impacts (in this case drought) to climate change are the most prominent determinants of risk perception.",2012,NA,Journal article,adaptability; age; beliefs; climate change; correlation analysis; databases; farmers; farmers' attitudes; gender relations; geographical information systems; household income; multiple regression; political attitudes; risk; rural areas; socioeconomics; water availability; water resources; water use,cabdirect,Yes,,,,,,

G.",Spatial variability in tree regeneration after wildfire delays and dampens future bark beetle outbreaks.,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,"Climate change is altering the frequency and severity of forest disturbances such as wildfires and bark beetle outbreaks, thereby increasing the potential for sequential disturbances to interact. Interactions can amplify or dampen disturbances, yet the direction and magnitude of future disturbance interactions are difficult to anticipate because underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. We tested how variability in postfire forest development affects future susceptibility to bark beetle outbreaks, focusing on mountain pine beetle (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Dendroctonus ponderosae</i>) and Douglas-fir beetle (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Dendroctonus pseudotsugae</i>) in forests regenerating from the large high-severity fires that affected Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming in 1988. We combined extensive field data on postfire tree regeneration with a well-tested simulation model to assess susceptibility to bark beetle outbreaks over 130 y of stand development. Despite originating from the same fire event, among-stand variation in forest structure was very high and remained considerable for over a century. Thus, simulated emergence of stands susceptible to bark beetles was not temporally synchronized but was protracted by several decades, compared with stand development from spatially homogeneous regeneration. Furthermore, because of fire-mediated variability in forest structure, the habitat connectivity required to support broad-scale outbreaks and amplifying cross-scale feedbacks did not develop until well into the second century after the initial burn. We conclude that variability in tree regeneration after disturbance can dampen and delay future disturbance by breaking spatiotemporal synchrony on the landscape. This highlights the importance of fostering landscape variability in the context of ecosystem management given changing disturbance regimes.",2016,NA,Journal article,arthropod pests; forest pests; insect pests; pests; plant pests; spatial variation; wildfires; pines,cabdirect,Yes,,,,,,

However, increasing evidence indicates that plant invasions do occur in these environments, which often have high conservation value and provide important ecosystem services. Over a thousand non-native species have become established in natural areas at high elevations worldwide, and although many of these are not invasive, some may pose a considerable threat to native mountain ecosystems. Here, we discuss four main drivers that shape plant invasions into high-elevation habitats: (1) the (pre-)adaptation of non-native species to abiotic conditions, (2) natural and anthropogenic disturbances, (3) biotic resistance of the established communities, and (4) propagule pressure. We propose a comprehensive research agenda for tackling the problem of plant invasions into mountain ecosystems, including documentation of mountain invasion patterns at multiple scales, experimental studies, and an assessment of the impacts of non-native species in these systems. The threat posed to high-elevation biodiversity by invasive plant species is likely to increase because of globalization and climate change. However, the higher mountains harbor ecosystems where invasion by non-native species has scarcely begun, and where science and management have the opportunity to respond in time.",2009,NA,Journal article,ecosystem services; introduced species; invasion; invasive alien species; invasive species; reviews; spread; weeds,cabdirect,Yes,,,,,,

G.","Disturbance, equilibrium, and environmental variability: what is 'natural' vegetation in a changing environment?",Biological Conservation,"The concept of 'natural' ecosystems is discussed with particular reference to North American ecological ideas about natural disturbance. To most early ecologists, the 'natural' ecosystem was the community that would be reached after a long period without large-scale disturbance (fire, windstorm, etc.). More recently, it has been realized that in most areas some type of large scale disturbance is indigenous, and must be included in any realistic definition of 'naturalness'. In some areas an equilibrium may exist in which patchy disturbance is balanced by regrowth, but in others equilibrium may be impossible because (1) individual disturbances are too large or infrequent, (2) ephemeral events have long-lasting disruptive effects, and/or (3) climate changes interrupt any movement toward equilibrium that does occur. Examples of non-equilibrium ecosystems include the East African savannas, the Big Woods of Minnesota, the lodgepole pine (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Pinus contorta </i>var. <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">latifolia</i>) forests of Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, and possibly the old-growth Douglas fir (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Pseudotsuga menziesii</i>) forests of the Pacific Northwest. Where an equilibrium does not exist, defining the 'natural' vegetation becomes much more difficult, because the vegetation in any given area would not be stable over long periods of time even without man's influence. In many areas it may be unrealistic to try to define the natural vegetation for a site; there are often several communities that could be the 'natural' vegetation for any given site at any given time.",1991,NA,Journal article,climax communities; Plant succession,cabdirect,Yes,,,,,,

Wheate, R","Quantifying the contribution of glacier runoff to streamflow in the upper Columbia River Basin, Canada",Hydrology and Earth System Sciences,"Glacier melt provides important contributions to streamflow in many mountainous regions. Hydrologic model calibration in glacier-fed catchments is difficult because errors in modelling snow accumulation can be offset by compensating errors in glacier melt. This problem is particularly severe in catchments with modest glacier cover, where goodness-of-fit statistics such as the Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency may not be highly sensitive to the streamflow variance associated with glacier melt. While glacier mass balance measurements can be used to aid model calibration, they are absent for most catchments. We introduce the use of glacier volume change determined from repeated glacier mapping in a guided GLUE (generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation) procedure to calibrate a hydrologic model. This approach is applied to the Mica basin in the Canadian portion of the Columbia River Basin using the HBV-EC hydrologic model. Use of glacier volume change in the calibration procedure effectively reduced parameter uncertainty and helped to ensure that the model was accurately predicting glacier mass balance as well as streamflow. The seasonal and interannual variations in glacier melt contributions were assessed by running the calibrated model with historic glacier cover and also after converting all glacierized areas to alpine land cover in the model setup. Sensitivity of modelled streamflow to historic changes in glacier cover and to projected glacier changes for a climate warming scenario was assessed by comparing simulations using static glacier cover to simulations that accommodated dynamic changes in glacier area. Although glaciers in the Mica basin only cover 5% of the watershed, glacier ice melt contributes up to 25% and 35% of streamflow in August and September, respectively. The mean annual contribution of ice melt to total streamflow varied between 3 and 9% and averaged 6%. Glacier ice melt is particularly important during warm, dry summers following winters with low snow accumulation and early snowpack depletion. Although the sensitivity of streamflow to historic glacier area changes is small and within parameter uncertainties, our results suggest that glacier area changes have to be accounted for in future projections of late summer streamflow. Our approach provides an effective and widely applicable method to calibrate hydrologic models in glacier fed catchments, as well as to quantify the magnitude and timing of glacier melt contributions to streamflow.",2012,NA,Scholarly Journals,NA,proquest,Yes,,,,,,

We examined the effects of climatic variability on the growth of Douglas-fir along an elevational gradient in the North Cascade Range, Washington (USA), at annual timescales during the 20th century. Multivariate analysis and correlation analysis were used to identify climate-growth relationships. Mid-elevation chronologies were negatively correlated with growing season maximum temperature and positively correlated with growing season precipitation. In contrast, high-elevation chronologies were positively correlated with annual temperatures and negatively correlated with previous-year winter Pacific Decadal Oscillation index. Projected increases in summer temperatures will likely cause greater soil moisture stress in many forested ecosystems. The potential of extended summer drought periods over decades may significantly alter spatial patterns of productivity, thus impacting carbon storage. It is likely that the productivity of Douglas-fir in the Cascade Range will decrease at sites with shallow, excessively drained soils, south- and west-facing aspects, and steep slopes and will increase at high-elevation sites.",2005,NA,Journal article,altitude; carbon sequestration; climate; climate change; correlation analysis; drought; forest soils; global warming; growth; multivariate analysis; precipitation; soil types; soil water; spatial variation; temperature; temporal variation; topography,cabdirect,Yes,,,,,,

Here, we investigate the relative influences of historical and contemporary gene flow and drift on the population genetic structure of Kirengeshoma palmata, a perennial herb from East China and South Japan. Methods: We used data from nine polymorphic microsatellite loci to assess the levels of genetic diversity, effective population size, and contemporary and historical gene flow for six of the seven known populations. Key results: We found high levels of inbreeding and allelic diversity within populations. Both contemporary and historical migration rates among populations were low, and a test of alternate models of population history strongly favored a model of long-term drift-migration equilibrium. We inferred declines in population size ca. 10000-100000 yr ago, but failed to detect recent declines. Bayesian clustering divided K. palmata populations into three genetic clusters, two of which were consistent with a glacial refugium hypothesis for two mountain ranges in East China. Conclusions: These results suggest that anthropogenic fragmentation has had little effect on the genetic characteristics of Chinese K. palmata. Rather, past decline in population size due to Late Pleistocene climate change as well as restricted pollen and seed dispersal may have contributed to low levels of both historical and contemporary gene flow, resulting in high genetic differentiation between adjacent mountain ranges due to genetic drift and inbreeding.",2014,10.3732/ajb.1400043,Plant Sciences,WOS:000340452200013,Adrienne,No,Maybe,No,,,Meghan,,,No,,,NA,,,,,Adrienne,No,Maybe,International,Asia,

Alpine areas in the Mediterranean region are of special concern because of the high abundance of endemic species with narrow ranges. This study combined species distribution models, population structure analyses and Bayesian skyline plots to trace the past and future distribution and diversity of Linaria glacialis, an endangered narrow endemic species that inhabits summits of Sierra Nevada (Spain). The results showed that: (i) the habitat of this alpine-Mediterranean species in Sierra Nevada suffered little changes during glacial and interglacial stages of late Quaternary; (ii) climatic oscillations in the last millennium (Medieval Warm Period and Little Ice Age) moderately affected the demographic trends of L. glacialis; (iii) future warming conditions will cause severe range contractions; and (iv) genetic diversity will not diminish at the same pace as the distribution range. As a consequence of the low population structure of this species, genetic impoverishment in the alpine zones of Sierra Nevada should be limited during range contraction.

We used tree data records to compare the influence of precipitation and temperature on radial growth among P. cooperi populations across a mountain landscape at elevation gradient. Correlation and regression analysis of the regional growth-climate relationships showed that radial growth was correlated with previous winter conditions at most sites along the gradient. Wet and cold winters were positively associated with radial growth. Although our results showed significant climate influences on tree radial growth, other site factors also may have affected growth-climate responses.

Pollen assemblages from both lakes are dominated by Chenopodiaceae (similar to 40%), Artemisia (similar to 30-35%) and Poaceae (similar to 20-25%), with continued occurrence but low abundance of Nitraria, Ephedra, and Cyperaceae. Artemisia/Chenopodiaceae (A/C) pollen ratios from two lakes show coherent large oscillations at centennial timescale during the last 1000 yr. A/C ratios were high around AD 1170, 1270, 1450, 1700 and 1920, suggesting that the vegetation was more ""steppe-like"" under a relatively moist climate than that during the intervening periods. Wet-dry climate shifts at the two lakes (2800 m asl) are in opposite phases to precipitation changes derived from tree-ring records in the Surrounding mountains (> 3700 m asl) and to pollen and snow accumulation records from Dunde ice core (5300 m asl), showing that a dry climate in the basin corresponds with a wet interval in the mountains, especially around AD 1600. This contrasting pattern implies that topography might have played an important role in mediating moisture changes at regional scale in this topographically complex region.

La Caldera (Sierra Nevada National Park, Spain) is an oligotrophic high mountain lake (3050 m a.s.l.) that has experienced large fluctuations in water volume (13-100%) during the past 20 years due to irregular annual precipitation patterns (371-1816 mm). Because of the lake's cold and dilute abiotic environment, it is likely susceptible to projected increases in global temperature and represents an ideal sentinel of global change. We analyze the effect of WLFs on water quality and on plankton community in La Caldera to better understand the potential effects of recurrent droughts (3 droughts in a 20-year period) on lake ecology. We have found significantly positive effects of WLFs on total phosphorus (TP) concentrations. There was extreme variability in TP concentrations during three recurrent droughts (1995, 1999, and 2005) reflecting sediment resuspension. However, the data also suggest that this was not the only source of phosphorus. Extremely high P-enriched atmospheric dust inputs could have maintained the abnormally high TP in-lake concentrations measured during 2005.

Results showed that there was an obvious increase in the temperature of the basin since 1987. Specifically in the mountainous area, the significantly increasing temperature in the summer and autumn seasons accelerated the melting rate of glaciers and caused glacial-lake burst. Sudden flood release occurred frequently. The frequency of glacial-lake outburst floods was 0.4 times/a during the period 1959-1986 and increased to 0.7 times/a during 1997-2006.

El Angel River Watershed Carchi, Ecuador. Disk 9 of 9. In: Himalayan Andean Collaborative Watershed Project, International Development Resource Centre, Ottawa] has produced practical recommendations for its sustainable management, with emphasis on new governance mechanisms. Comparatively little is said about questions of watershed stability in geomorphic terms, though water supply, sources and sinks are identified as crucially important. In this paper, three alternative frameworks, those of montology, less favoured area investment and panarchy, are examined. It is concluded that each of these frameworks, by insisting on a balance between socio-economic and biophysical analysis, does offer scope for the incorporation of geomorphic concepts though none of them demand explicit geomorphic content. The framework, which seems most flexible, is the panarchy metaphor [Holling, C.S., 2001. Understanding the complexity of economic, ecological and social systems. Ecosystems 4: 390-405.]. Not only does this framework insist on asking questions about the socio-economic and biophysical organisation of the watershed system, but it also leads to some arresting conclusions about the probable imminent collapse of watersheds under increasing population and land-use pressure. The panarchy metaphor identifies collapse and reorganisation as a common characteristic of socio-economic and biophysical systems. If this metaphor is even close to being accurate, the first issue in sustainable management of this small Andean watershed is how to ensure a ""creative"" collapse leading to a more sustainable system. A significant geomorphic contribution in this context would seem to include the identification of functioning hydro-geomorphic response units, connectivities and spatial-scale effects leading to more nuanced application of management strategies.

Glacier-related debris flows are, in part, a consequence of general glacier retreat and the corresponding exposure of large quantities of unconsolidated, unvegetated, and sometimes ice-cored glacial sediments. This paper documents glacier-related debris flows at 17 sites in the Italian, French, and Swiss Alps, with a focus on the Italian northwest sector. For each case data are provided which describe the glacier and the instability. Three types of events have been recognized, based on antecedent meteorological conditions. Type 1 (9 documented debris flows) is triggered by intense and prolonged rainfall, causing water saturation of sediments and consequent failure of large sediment volumes (up to 800000 m 3). Type 2 (2 debris flows) is triggered by short rainstorms which may destabilize the glacier drainage system, with debris flow volumes up to 100000 m(3). Type 3 (6 debris flows) occurs during dry weather by glacial lake outbursts or ground/buried ice melting, with debris flow volumes up to 150000 m(3).

The occurrence of these speleothems, their low carbon isotopic composition, and the lack of infiltrated silicielastic material demonstrate that the central Inn valley - which harbored one of the most extensive valley glaciers during the last glacial maximum - was ice-free during Marine Isotope Stages 5c to 5a. Climatically warm periods are separated by distinct drops in the oxygen isotopic composition of the speleothem calcite, attributed to strong and possibly seasonally biased atmospheric cooling. During these intervening stadials, which mirror those identified in the Greenland ice cores and marine sea-surface temperature records, calcite deposition apparently came to a halt, but the Inn Valley remained ice-free.

Worldwide glacier monitoring, especially as part of the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS), includes the systematic collection of data on such perennial surface ice masses. Several peaks in the sierras of Colombia have lost their glacier cover during recent decades. Today, high-altitude glaciers still exist in Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, in Sierra Nevada del Cocuy and on the volcanoes of Nevados del Ruiz, de Santa Isabel, del Tolima and del Huila. Comparison of reconstructions of maximum glacier area extent during the Little Ice Age with more recent information from aerial photographs and satellite images clearly documents a fast-shrinking tendency and potential disappearance of the remaining glaciers within the next few decades. In the past 50 years, Colombian glaciers have lost 50% or more of their area. Glacier shrinkage has continued to be strong in the last 15 years, with a loss of 10-50% of the glacier area. The relationship between fast glacier retreat and local, regional and global climate change is now being investigated. Preliminary analyses indicate that the temperature rise of roughly 1 degrees C in the last 30 years recorded at high-altitude meteorological stations exerts a primary control on glacier retreat. The investigations on the Colombian glaciers thus corroborate earlier findings concerning the high sensitivity of glaciers in the wet inner tropics to temperature rise. To improve understanding of fast glacier retreat in Colombia, a modern monitoring network has been established according to the multilevel strategy of the Global Terrestrial Network for Glaciers (GTN-G) within GCOS. The observations are also contributions to continued assessments of hazards from the glacier-covered volcanoes and to integrated global change research in mountain biosphere reserves.",2006,10.3189/172756406781812429,Geology,WOS:000245520800028,Meghan,No,Yes,No,,,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Adrienne,No,Maybe,International,Colombia,

The roles of water and energy variables in shaping the observed species-elevation relationship were tested, as well as how growth form and photobiont type distribution varied along the gradient. LocationSouth Tyrol, northern Italy. MethodsEight sites were selected spanning the elevational range of spruce forests (900-1900m a.s.l.) and the regional rainfall gradient. At each site, a pair of forest stands (one mature even-aged and one multilayered) was selected at three elevation steps. Epiphytic lichens were surveyed according to European guidelines for lichen diversity monitoring. Explanatory variables indicative of both forest structure and climate were included in the models. ResultsA positive relationship was found between number of species and elevation. This reflected the physiological response of epiphytic lichens to the main climatic factors, trait selection being the mechanism that determined the response at community level. Nonlinear species-temperature and trait-temperature relationships predicted that major changes may be expected in the intermediate part of the gradient. Lichens with a Trentepohlia algal partner were more frequent at lower elevations and proved to be sensitive to environmental factors indicative of forest structure. Lichen growth forms had contrasting patterns related to temperature, crustose species richness being enhanced by increasing values, and alectorioid and foliose lichens by decreasing values. Alectorioid lichens were also negatively influenced by rainfall. Main conclusionsIn a climate change scenario, lichen diversity in alpine regions will probably not benefit from an increase in air temperature in the same way as flowering plants.

Consequently, the atmospheric, hydrological and geomorphic controls on these hydrogeomorphic processes are poorly understood, leading to highly uncertain warning and risk management. On the other hand, remote sensing of precipitation and numerical weather predictions have become the basis of several flood forecasting systems, enabling increasingly accurate detection of hazardous events. The objective of this paper is to provide a review on current European and international research on early warning systems for flash floods and debris flows. We expand upon these themes by identifying: (a) the state of the art; (b) knowledge gaps; and (c) suggested research directions to advance warning capabilities for extreme hydrogeomorphic processes. We also suggest three areas in which advancements in science will have immediate and important practical consequence, namely development of rainfall estimation and nowcasting schemes suited to the specific space-time scales, consolidating physical, engineering and social datasets of flash floods and debris-flows, integration of methods for multiple hydrogeomorphic hazard warning.

This study looked at simulated and observed hydrological components in a small watershed containing fragments of the Atlantic Forest. The performance of the Distributed Hydrology Soil Vegetation Model (DHSVM) and the effects of possible land cover change scenarios in the Lavrinha Watershed, in the Mantiqueira Range, Minas Gerais State, Brazil, were analyzed. The model was calibrated and validated using four years of continuous hydro-climate data sets, and the simulated daily and monthly streamflow showed acceptable agreement with the observed. A comparison of hypothetical land cover change scenarios showed that deforestation in the Atlantic Forest biome leads to increases in monthly soil moisture (by 5%), overland flow (by 33%) and total runoff (by 22%), with a corresponding decrease in interception (by 71%), evapotranspiration (by 30%) and water table depth (by 10%). These changes in land surface hydrology resulted in an increase in daily high and low streamflows (by 17% and 25%), with the opposite occurring when pasture was converted to Atlantic Forest. The results also show that the hydrology of a headwater tropical watershed is characterized by seasonal variability in rainfall and land cover changes and that there are connections among the topography, land cover, soil types and wet and dry seasons that maintain the spatial distribution of the hydrologic components in the watershed.

However, such watersheds are often poorly instrumented, making it difficult to link recent and rapid climate change to landscape response. Here we combine unique records of river flow and sediment export, with historical archival imagery to test the hypothesis that climate warming has substantially increased both water yield and sediment export from small Alpine watersheds (<3 km(2)) characterized by small (<0.5 km(2) surface) glaciers. To examine ice and landform response to climate change, we apply archival digital photogrammetry to historical aerial imagery available from 1967 to present. We use the resulting data on ice loss, in combination with reliable records of stream flow from hydroelectric power intakes and climate data to approximate a water budget and to determine the evolution of different contributions to river flow. We use the stream flow records to estimate volumetric sediment transport capacity and compare this with the volumes of sand and gravel exported from the watersheds, quantified from records of intake flushing. The data show clearly that climate forcing since the early 1980s has been accompanied by a net increase in both water yield and sediment transport capacity, and we attribute these as signals of reduced snow accumulation and glacier recession. However, sediment export has not responded in the same way and we attribute this to limits on sediment delivery to streams because of poor rockwall-hillslope-channel connectivity. However, we do find that extreme climate conditions can be seen in sediment export data suggesting that these, rather than mean climate warming, may dominate watershed response.",2016,10.1002/2016WR018774,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Water Resources,WOS:000380100200038,Paris,No,Yes,No,,Switzerland,NA,,,,,,Adrienne,No,Yes,No,Switzerland,Adrienne,No,Yes,International,,

Treelines are expected to react to current climate warming by showing upslope migrations. However, treeline dynamics are often characterized by lagged responses to rising temperatures, that is, treeline inertia. In addition, encroachment within the treeline ecotone seems to be a more widespread response to climate warming than treeline ascent. We investigate how the treeline responds to climate in a Pyrenean site with an intense Mountain pine (Pinus uncinata) regeneration but also abundant dead trees. We use dendrochronology to reconstruct treeline dynamics (growth, tree recruitment, and death) and to build an age structure of Pyrenean Mountain pine forests, and relate them to temperature reconstructions of the study area. We also describe the spatial structure and estimate the size reproductive threshold of pine recruits. The study treeline showed profuse pine recruitment in the 1980s. These recruits were spatially aggregated and reached the 50% probability of reproduction at 24 years old. Most Pyrenean Mountain pines were recruited in the first half of the 18th century, a warm period when growth was stable, while old treeline trees recruited not only in those decades but also in previous warm periods. Pine deaths concentrated in the cool transition between the mid 17th and the early 18th centuries and mainly from 1820 to 1860, when growth declined as a consequence of temperatures rapidly dropping at the end of the Little Ice Age. Only the amount of dead pines at the treeline was negatively related to temperatures, indicating that cool periods cause high adult mortality rates and trigger long-term treeline decline. But this decline was interrupted by intense regeneration and treeline encroachment, two features that characterize recent treeline dynamics in some mountains. This concurs with the view of a rapid response of alpine treelines to climate during the late 20th century.",2015,10.1657/AAAR0015-001,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Physical Geography,WOS:000363863300014,Paris,No,Yes,No,,Spain,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Adrienne,No,Maybe,International,,

The paleoshoreline features were first identified on RADARSAT satellite SAR imagery. We investigated the features during the 1998 field season of the Joint Mongolian-Russian-American Archaeological Expedition to the Gobi-Altai region. We identified paleoshorelines of multiple elevations in the field, which are considered to be relict beach ridges and wave-cut terraces. Other paleolake landforms include spits and Gilbert-type deltas. These landforms are complex, large and well established, implying that the paleolakes were stable for extended periods. The reconstructed paleolakes cover extensive areas of the valley floor, implying that hydrological and climatic conditions were very different in the past. Paleolake expansions may have occurred under a variety of circumstances. One hypothesis is that the high lake stands occurred during the wetter period corresponding to the Oxygen Isotope Stage 3 prior to the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), during the warmest early Holocene and the late Holocene, or during all these periods. If low evaporation rates due to lower temperatures, glacier meltwater and possibly increased precipitation are important factors, then the expansions may have occurred during the terminal Late Glacial period after the Last Glacial Maximum. The greatly expanded lakes in the Gobi-Altai could have significantly affected the Quaternary human demography and migration in the region. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Tree mortality caused by bark beetle outbreaks alters carbon cycling in the first several years following the disturbance by reducing stand-level primary production and by increasing the amount of dead organic matter available for decomposition. The few studies of biogeochemical cycling following outbreaks have shown a range of impacts from small responses of net carbon fluxes in the first several years after a severe outbreak to large forest areas that are sources of carbon to the atmosphere for decades. To gain more understanding about causes of this range of responses, we used an ecosystem model to assess impacts of different bark beetle outbreak conditions on coupled carbon and nitrogen cycling. We modified the Community Land Model with prognostic carbon and nitrogen to include prescribed bark beetle outbreaks. We then compared control simulations (without a bark beetle outbreak) to simulations with various levels of mortality severity, durations of outbreak, and snagfall dynamics to quantify the range of carbon flux responses and recovery rates of net ecosystem productivity to a range of realistic outbreak conditions. Our simulations illustrate that, given the large variability in bark beetle outbreak conditions, a wide range of responses in carbon and nitrogen dynamics can occur.

The results show a generally good skill of the observation-driven VIC model in replicating most of the WRIs and IHAs. Although the WRIs, including annual volume, centre of timing, and seasonal flows, and the IHAs, including maximum and minimum flows, were reasonably well replicated, statistically significant differences in some of the monthly flows, number and duration of flow pulses, rise and fall rates, and reversals were noted. In the case of GCM-driven results, additional monthly, maximum, and minimum flow indicators produced statistically significant differences. A number of issues with the model input/output data, hydrologic model parametrization and structure as well as downscaling methods were identified, which lead to such discrepancies. Therefore, there is a need to exercise caution in the use of model-simulated indicators.

Identifying how those changes are affecting the biosphere is essential if we are going to be able to adapt to those changes and to potentially mitigate their harmful consequences. This paper presents a time series study of an alpine ecosystem in the Big Pine Creek watershed in California's Eastern Sierra Nevada Mountain's. Raw Landsat data covering the years 1984 through 2011 is converted to observed surface reflectance and analyzed for trends that would indicate a change in the ecosystem. We found that over the time period of the study, observed surface reflectance shows a general decline across the spectrum while our analysis of environmental data demonstrates statistically significant increases in temperatures. While declining reflectance in the visible and short wave bands are indicators of increased surface cover, the fact that the IR band also shows declines is consistent with a decline in tree density. This study provides a useful insight into the ecological response of the Big Pine Creek watershed to recent climate change. These findings suggest that alpine ecosystems are particularly sensitive to increasing temperatures. If these results are replicated in other alpine watersheds it will demonstrate that the biosphere is already showing the effects of a warmer environment. (C) 2014 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We used the Distributed Hydrology Soil Vegetation Model for the hydrologic modelling of the basin, assuming four vegetation scenarios: current forest (partial cover, 80% density), all forest (uniform coverage, 80% density), all barren (no forest) and thinned forest (partial cover, 40% density) for a medium-high emissions scenario causing a 3.9 degrees C warming over a 100-year period (2001-2100). Significant advances in streamflow timing, quantified as the centre of mass (COM) of over 1month were projected for all vegetation scenarios. However, the COM advances faster with increased forest coverage. For example, when forest covered the entire area, the COM occurred on average 12days earlier compared with the current forest coverage, with the rate of advance higher by about 0.06daysyear-1 over 100years and with peak and late summer flows lower by about 20% and 27%, respectively. Examination of modelled changes in energy balance components at forested and barren sites as temperatures rise indicated that increases in net longwave radiation are higher in the forest case and have a higher contribution to melting earlier in the calendar year when shortwave radiation is a smaller fraction of the energy budget. These increases contributed to increased midwinter melt under the forest at temperatures above freezing, causing decreases in total accumulation and higher winter and early spring melt rates. These results highlight the importance of carefully considering the combined impacts of changing forest cover and climate on downstream water supply and mountain ecosystems.

In recent decades, mountain pine beetle (MPB; Dendroctonus ponderosae) outbreaks have become more frequent and extensive in western North America. Remote sensing has the ability to fill the data gaps of long-term infestation monitoring, but the elimination of observational noise and attributing changes quantitatively are two main challenges in its effective application. Here, we present a forest growth trend analysis method that integrates Landsat temporal trajectories and decision tree techniques to derive annual forest disturbance maps over an 11-year period. The temporal trajectory component successfully captures the disturbance events as represented by spectral segments, whereas decision tree modeling efficiently recognizes and attributes events based upon the characteristics of the segments. Validated against a point set sampled across a gradient of MPB mortality, 86.74% to 94.00% overall accuracy was achieved with small variability in accuracy among years. In contrast, the overall accuracies of single-date classifications ranged from 37.20% to 75.20% and only become comparable with our approach when the training sample size was increased at least four-fold. This demonstrates that the advantages of this time series work flow exist in its small training sample size requirement.

In recent decades, however, wildfire suppression and reduced harvests in western North America have created a forest landscape that is densely stocked and increasingly susceptible to bark beetle infestations, especially as the climate becomes warmer and drier. We examine the various MPB treatment options available to land managers, including insecticides, semiochemicals, sanitation, and silvicultural treatments, and describe their long-term consequences in terms of risk of future bark beetle outbreaks, wildfire, invasion by exotic weeds, loss of hydrologic values, and carbon sequestration. Paradoxically, the treatments that are most enduring and best preserve the ecosystem services of North American forests are ones that result in some thinning of these stands. We, therefore, propose a renewed focus on silvicultural treatments over large spatial scales, particularly in lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Douglas ex Loudon), and recommend semiochemical treatments, which may not protect all trees, for the protection of high-value trees, especially for high-elevation pines that grow in smaller stands.

In snow-dominated systems, snow, surface and subsurface hydrologic processes comprise a complex network of nonlinear interactions that influence the magnitude and timing of discharge. This study aims to identify critical processes and interactions that control discharge hydrographs in five major mountainous snow-dominated river basins in Colorado, USA. A comprehensive watershed model (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) and a variance-based global sensitivity analysis technique (Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test) were used in conjunction to identify critical models parameters and processes that they represent. Average monthly streamflow and streamflow root mean square error over a period of 20 years were used as two separate objective functions in this analysis. Examination of the sensitivity of monthly streamflow revealed the influence of parameters on flow volume, whereas the sensitivity of streamflow root mean square error also exposed the influence of parameters on the timing of the hydrographs. A stability analysis was performed to investigate the computational requirements for a robust sensitivity analysis. Results show that streamflow volume is mostly influenced by shallow subsurface processes, whereas interactions between groundwater and snow processes were the key in the timing of streamflows. A large majority of important parameters were common among all study watersheds, which underlies the prospect for regionalization of process-based hydrologic modelling in headwater river basins in Colorado.

Changes in snowpack are likely to have important consequences for water and carbon cycling in these and downstream ecosystems. Particularly within semi-arid environments, snowpack changes will directly influence localized water and carbon dynamics and indirectly influence regional-scale levels of water availability and carbon sequestration. In this study, we monitor soil evaporation (E) and soil respiration (R) and evaluate how snow cover affects these effluxes within a mixed-conifer ecosystem within the Santa Catalina Mountains about 10km north of Tucson, Arizona. Using time-lapse digital photos, we identified areas of consistent short and long snow duration, and we monitored E and R in these areas every 2weeks for 15months. Our primary findings include the following: (1) Dynamics of E are not different between long and short snow season sites, (2) E for both short and long snow seasons has a strong relationship with soil moisture and a poor relationship with soil temperature, (3) dynamics of R vary between long and short snow season sites throughout the year, with short snow season fluxes typically higher than those of long snow season sites, and (4) R for short and long snow seasons has a strong relationship with soil temperature and a poor relationship with soil moisture. Because climate change will only exacerbate both drying-wetting and cooling-warming cycles, detangling these complex relationships becomes increasingly important for understanding shifts in carbon dynamics in these subalpine mixed-conifer ecosystems.

In this study, we develop a UV-temperature response model to predict the establishment potential of a warmwater fish, largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), in a large subalpine lake based on the ability of bass larvae to tolerate UV and temperature stress along a UV-temperature stress gradient. LocationLake Tahoe (California/Nevada, USA). MethodsWe compared the UV tolerance of largemouth bass larvae to that of the native redside minnow (Richardsonius egregius) in outdoor UV exposure-response experiments. A UV-temperature response model for larval bass was developed that combined the experimentally derived UV exposure response from our outdoor experiments with a temperature response curve derived from the literature. We used the UV-temperature response model to predict reproductive success (i.e. larval survival) over the range of UV exposure and temperature conditions in nearshore Lake Tahoe. The model predictions were validated with in situ incubation experiments at nearshore locations. ResultsNon-native bass were significantly less UV tolerant than native redside minnows. The UV-temperature response model predicted that larval bass survival varies seasonally, spatially and over depth gradients in nearshore Lake Tahoe and is constrained by UV and temperature conditions. In situ incubation experiments confirmed model predictions. Main conclusionsOur findings provide important insights into the potential for species invasion in clear, cold-water lakes that are experiencing significant changes in both temperature and transparency.

This study assessed the potential climateinduced changes to in-stream sediment and nutrient loads in the snowmelt- dominated Sprague River, Oregon, western US. Additionally, potential water quality impacts of combined changes in wetland water balance and wetland area under future climatic conditions were evaluated. The study utilized the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) forced with statistical downscaling of general circulation model (GCM) data from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) using the Multivariate Adaptive Constructed Analogs (MACA) method.

We found that snow depth as a function of elevation increased approximately 15 cm per 100 m, until reaching an elevation of 3300 m, where depth sharply decreased at a rate of 48 cm per 100 m. Departures from the 15 cm per 100 m trend, based on 1 m elevation-band means of regression residuals, showed slightly less steep increases below 2050 m; steeper increases between 2050 and 3300 m; and less steep increases above 3300 m. Although the study area is partly forested, only measurements in open areas were used. Below approximately 2050 m elevation, ablation and rainfall are the primary causes of departure from the orographic trend. From 2050 to 3300 m, greater snow depths than predicted were found on the steeper terrain of the northwest and the less steep northeast-facing slopes, suggesting that ablation, aspect, slope and wind redistribution all play a role in local snow-depth variability. At elevations above 3300 m, orographic processes mask the effect of wind deposition when averaging over large areas. Also, terrain in this basin becomes less steep above 3300 m. This suggests a reduction in precipitation from upslope lifting and/or the exhaustion of precipitable water from ascending air masses. Our results suggest a cumulative precipitation lapse rate for the 2100-3300 m range of about 6 cm per 100 m elevation for the accumulation period of 3 December 2009 to 23 March 2010. This is a higher gradient than the widely used PRISM (Parameter-elevation Relationships on Independent Slopes Model) precipitation products, but similar to that from re-construction of snowmelt amounts from satellite snow-cover data. Our findings provide a unique characterization of the consistent, steep average increase in precipitation with elevation in snow-dominated terrain, using high-resolution, highly accurate data and highlighs the importance of solar radiation, wind redistribution and mid-winter melt with regard to snow distribution.",2014,10.5194/hess-18-4261-2014,Geology; Water Resources,WOS:000344730300026,Adrienne,No,Yes,No,,,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Adrienne,No,Maybe,No,California,

If the capacity of forests to provide valued ecological goods and services in the future is to be maintained, new tools and approaches will be needed. Several approaches have been influential in dealing with sustainability challenges in forest management and forestry to date, two of the most notable being the ecosystem approach and adaptive management. Resilience-based approaches have now emerged as a new paradigm to deal with these challenges. This paper considers how resilience thinking might inform forest management by exploring its conceptual basis in comparison with the ecosystem approach and adaptive management as two earlier influences. We identify three novel conceptual contributions and outline some of the key challenges encountered when applying resilience thinking to the management of forests. Resilience thinking offers new conceptual contributions for dealing with large and uncertain changes, the relationships between social and ecological components of forest systems, and a new perspective on sustainability. However, there are several barriers to it informing forest management in a practical way, including means by which resilience can be measured and valued within a management context, and most importantly, how resilience can be maintained and enhanced within systems focused on resource production or service provision. Resilience thinking's contributions are largely conceptual at this stage and offer more in terms a problem-framing approach than analytical or practical tools. Decision-relevant, science-based, and solution-oriented approaches are required to tackle future forest management challenges. Resilience thinking, if developed to become more solution-orientated could offer a needed complement to current management paradigms. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Site elevations range from 1848 m to 3392 m; relative to the broad range of pika sites in the region, the new locations have climates that are 2-4 degrees C warmer and receive approximately half the annual precipitation. Sites are located in lava flows and domes, inselbergs (isolated, rocky exposures on a small hill), eroding bedrock, rock-glacier till, talus slopes, and anthropogenic roadbed armaments and mining ore dumps. Several sites are situated in uncommon vegetation contexts, for example, montane desert scrub communities or locations where vegetation adjacent to taluses is sparse or lacking. Proximity to surrounding pika habitats (as a measure of marginality) was evaluated based on relative talus distribution patterns for 0.5-km, 2.5-1cm, and 5.0-km circular areas nested around each site. Seven idealized, schematic spatial patterns were used to assess potential connectivity among sites, ranging from ""island"" (no other talus within the respective areas) to ""even"" (many talus patches regularly distributed).

Carriere)) of the central Sierra Nevada, California, USA, a region with deep spring snowpack followed by strong summer drought. Chronologies for the six species exhibited a high degree of synchrony in their response to annual fluctuations in temperature and precipitation. For all six species, cool, wet conditions in the year prior to growth are conducive to good radial growth, as well as warm springs with sufficient moisture during the year of growth. For species more common on protected slopes, such as mountain hemlock, deep spring snowpack can limit growth. Although predictions of future precipitation trends in the region are uncertain, drought stress appears to already be increasing. If this trend continues, radial growth is likely to be inhibited for most or all species in our study.

We used a landscape-scale analysis to quantify historical channel migrations and changes in the extent of specific forest types. This GIS-based analysis using a 70-year aerial photographic record was complemented by field-based research. Thirty-eight plots containing 4509 trees were sampled for forest structure, age, and elevation above the contemporary channel. These data, including a vegetation chronosequence spanning over 500 years, were used to examine channel and landscape dynamics. Our findings support a general conceptual model that describes cycles of patch development and destruction in unconfined alluvial forests of the Pacific Coastal Ecoregion. Over the past century, Carmanah River has eroded nearly 30% of the alluvial forest in this study area, and approximately 65% over the past 500 years. At least 80% of the 2007 channel was forested area within the past 70 years. Younger landforms were disturbed more frequently than mature forest patches, which suggest that as biogeomorphic succession progresses the likelihood of future disturbance decreases. Estimated half lives of landforms ranged from 24 years for pioneer bars to over 1500 years for old growth terraces. Years of regional high magnitude floods resulted in a net loss of floodplain forest area indicating that disturbance was climate driven in this pluvial watershed, whereby rain events result in flood disturbance that converted forests to channel. These events initiate a subsequent course of vegetation succession and geomorphic development, and often result in the deposition of large wood that modifies the channel environment and contributes to channel avulsion and further hydrogeomorphic disturbance. The composition of the landscape is a reflection of the balance between the disturbance rate and successional development. We also observed a relationship between landscape composition and watershed size. Specifically, the ratio of mature to developing alluvial forests was higher in this smaller watershed compared to larger watersheds in the region. Results imply that larger flood events predicted to occur with climate change may change the disturbance regime of floodplain forests and alter landscape composition. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The distribution uses Infiltration Tabulator for Yucca Mountain (ITYM) model results to estimate uncertainty in net infiltration given decadal-average climate, driven with two independent estimates for potential future climatic sequences. Both future climatic sequences use orbital mechanics linked to paleoclimatic proxies to estimate future climate states, but one uses primarily biotic indicators and the other uses primarily abiotic indicators to link paleoclimate to orbital stage. Abiotic indicators suggest that present-day climate variation by latitude in the Great Basin is reasonably analogous to glacial-scale climate variation at a single location once orographic, lake effect, and insolation influences are accounted for. In the southern Sierra Nevada, abiotic indicators suggest that mean annual precipitation was 1.7-1.9 times larger than present and mean annual temperature was 5.6-7 degrees C cooler than present at the last glacial maximum. The influence of decadal to millennial-scale variability is estimated using the 8000 year Methuselah Walk tree-ring record, which suggests that even large inferred fluctuations over the Holocene only modestly increase 8000-year-average infiltration. Combining the future-climate projections with the infiltration model uncertainty distribution yields approximately lognormal uncertainty distributions for projected million-year areal-average net infiltration, with a mean of 41 mm/yr and coefficient of variation of 0.81. Even if anthropogenic effects significantly alter climatic patterns relative to past climate cycles, the projected anthropogenic period is sufficiently brief that million-year averages are not likely to be substantially influenced.",2013,10.1002/2013WR014122,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Water Resources,WOS:000328683800027,Adrienne,No,Maybe,No,,,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Adrienne,No,Maybe,No,Yucca Mountain,

Global climate change impacts drought frequency and severity and is implicated in the range expansion of the mountain pine beetle into formerly unsuitable habitats. Its expanded range has recently reached the lodgepole x jack pine hybrid zone in central Alberta, Canada, which could act as a transition from its historical lodgepole pine host to a jack pine host present in the boreal forest. This field study tested the effects of water limitation on chemical defenses of mature trees against mountain pine beetle-associated microorganisms and on beetle brood success in lodgepole x jack pine hybrid trees. Tree chemical defenses as measured by monoterpene emission from tree boles and monoterpene concentration in needles were greater in trees that experienced water deficit compared to well-watered trees. Myrcene was identified as specific defensive compound, since it significantly increased upon inoculation with dead mountain pine beetles. Beetles reared in bolts from trees that experienced water deficit emerged with a higher fat content, demonstrating for the first time experimentally that drought conditions benefit mountain pine beetles. Further, our study demonstrated that volatile chemical emission from tree boles and phloem chemistry place the hybrid tree chemotype in-between lodgepole pine and jack pine, which might facilitate the host shift from lodgepole pine to jack pine.",2013,10.1007/s10886-013-0334-8,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WOS:000325247400009,Adrienne,No,Yes,No,,,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Adrienne,No,Maybe,No,Alberta,

To date, research has focused on a range of mammal species. However, for rare-occurring, wide-ranging species such as wolverines (Gulo gulo), collecting the required information can be challenging. Highway crossing structures have been recommended as a conservation strategy for wolverines in the northern U.S. Rocky Mountains. However, there is virtually no information describing wolverine response to crossing mitigation. I describe 15 years of continuous year-round monitoring (1996-2012) of wolverine response to highway mitigation in Banff National Park, Alberta. Crossing structures were monitored using track pads and cameras. Wolverines were detected using crossing structures 10 times. Nine crossings occurred at wildlife underpasses and one at a wildlife overpass. The first detected passage occurred in 2005. Three crossings were recorded during the same crossing check in 2010 and 2011, suggesting use by the same individual of the structures. Few conclusions can be drawn regarding the attributes of crossing structures that facilitate passage of wolverines. Given the scarcity of crossing structures within wolverine range, it will be difficult to collect sufficient information in the short term for this rare and elusive species.

The biomass and composition of the bacterial and fungal communities were measured for 2 years following the establishment of the experiment. Minor disturbance (coring) had little impact on microbial biomass but transferring between vegetation type showed greater fungal biomass in soil incubated in the forest environment.

We tested this prediction by comparing empirical data from a historic data set with data collected from re-sampled sites from 200709. Location Central Sierra Nevada, CA, USA, 23003400m elevation. Methods We re-sampled 139 undisturbed historical vegetation plots across 5500km2 originally sampled from 192934 in the subalpine zone of the Sierra Nevada, and compared historical with current forest structure and composition. We compared historic and modern climatic conditions using two high-elevation climate stations nearby. Results Subalpine forests experienced a net increase in tree stem density of 30.4%, including a 63.3% increase in small trees. Six of eight tree species showed statistically significant increases in small tree density, including species with distributions at both the upper and lower boundaries of subalpine. Increases in small tree density were partly offset by a 20% decrease in large trees. These shifts were significant throughout the landscape of our study area. Modern stand composition was indistinguishable from historical composition. Daily minimum temperature (+1.2 degrees C) and precipitation (+1548%) both increased during the same period. Main conclusions Warming temperatures plus steady to increasing precipitation have led to less stressful conditions for recruitment and survival of small trees, and are probably contributing to increased mortality of large trees. Tree abundance and composition in the subalpine has not changed in the direction predicted by vegetation models linked to future climate scenarios. Our results underline the fundamental role that moisture balance plays in structuring mediterranean-zone montane forests.

Field investigations at Confederation, Franklin, and Jambeau glaciers led to the discovery of subfossil wood mats encased in glacial deposits and glacially sheared stumps buried beneath till. RADiocarbon-dated wood collected from valley-bottom and lateral moraine sites at Confederation Glacier suggest that an early-Holocene ADvance occurred at c. 5665 cal. yr BP, followed by succeeding intervals of glacier expansion at c. 3700 and 3500 cal. yr BP. At Jambeau Glacier detrital wood mats buried close to the contemporary lateral moraine crests document glacier expansion at c. 3000 cal. yr BP. Detrital subfossil wood buried in lateral moraines at the confluence of Confederation and Franklin glaciers records distinct episodes of 'Little Ice Age' glacier expansion as early as c. 1212 cal. yr AD, and suggests the glacier surface continued to thicken until at least c. 1330-1410 cal. yr AD.

These geohydrologic elements are fundamental to better understand patterns in species assemblages and indicator taxa and are necessary to aquatic monitoring protocols that aim to track changes in physical conditions. Complex physical variables shape many biological and ecological traits, including life history strategies, but these mechanisms can only be understood if critical physical variables are adequately represented within the sampling framework. To better align sampling design protocols with current geohydrologic knowledge, we present a conceptual framework that incorporates regional-scale conditions, basin-scale longitudinal profiles, valley-scale glacial macroform structure, valley segment-scale (i.e., colluvial, alluvial, and bedrock), and reach-scale channel types. At the valley segment- and reach-scales, these hierarchical levels are associated with differences in streamflow and sediment regime, water source contribution and water temperature.

To date, however, observations of changing SWE or snowmelt have been limited to the state of Colorado in the intermountain west (IMW), defined here as the Rio Grande, Colorado River, and Great Basins, which supply water to the driest regions of North America. We used daily SNOTEL data collected between 1984 and 2009 combined with the nonparametric regional Kendall test to demonstrate significant and widespread changes in the duration of snow cover in these river basins. Daily SNOTEL data demonstrated that basin average maximum SWE occurred as early as 7 March (Lower Colorado River Basin) and as late as 13 April (Upper Colorado, Yampa, and White River Basins). Although significant increases in winter temperature (T) were widespread, there were minimal changes in the day of maximum accumulation and no indications from SWE to winter precipitation ratios (SWE: P) and winter T observations that a transition from snow to rain had occurred. While there was little change in day of maximum accumulation, the duration of snow cover decreased in 11 of 13 drainage regions, and snowmelt center of mass (SM50) advanced 1 to 4 days per decade in 6 of 13 regions. There were significant trends toward a faster SM50 and shorter duration of snow cover in the highest-elevation regions (>2800 m) of the Colorado River Basin, suggesting that winter T and P may not be the primary driver of change. Our results show that the IMW hydroclimate is both spatially and temporally variable, with few changes in winter T and P in the Great Basin and drier and warmer winters in the Colorado River and Rio Grande Basins. The changes in snowmelt timing also were variable, with a shorter SM50 and less maximum SWE in the Colorado River and Rio Grande Basins.

Because rain falls faster than snow, it is not advected as far by prevailing winds before reaching the ground. A shift in precipitation phase thus may alter precipitation patterns. Using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) regional climate model at 27-9-3 km resolutions over the California Sierra Nevada, we conducted an idealized experiment consisting of a present climate control run and two additional simulations in which (a) fall speed for snow is similar to rain and (b) all precipitation is constrained to fall as liquid. Rather than simulating future climates directly, these perturbation experiments allow us to test the potential impacts of changing precipitation phase in isolation from other factors such as variable large-scale atmospheric circulation. Relative to the control, both perturbations result in a rain shadow deepened by similar to 30-60%, with increased focusing of precipitation on the western Sierra Nevada slopes best resolved at <= 9 km resolutions. Our results suggest that altered precipitation phase associated with climate change will likely affect spatial distributions of water resources, floods, and landslides in the Sierra Nevada and similar midlatitude mountain ranges.

In recent years, tree mortality has been gaining attention as dramatic occurrences of forest die-off have been linked to climate change. Using permanent sample plot data, we examined tree mortality rates in mature forests in west-central Alberta from 1956 to 2007. We quantified mortality risk at an individual-tree level as a function of size, local competition, and calendar year, a proxy for increasing temperature, and used maximum likelihood methods to estimate species-specific model parameters. Tree size and local competition were both important predictors of mortality risk. However, once these factors were included in our model, no additional variation could be attributed to calendar year, indicating that the trend of increasing tree mortality over time found in our raw data is primarily a result of stand development processes. This finding is supported by the changes in forest structure and composition that we documented over the study period. Stands generally increased in basal area and stem density, and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia Engelm. ex S. Watson) declined in abundance relative to the more shade-tolerant black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B. S. P.) and white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss).

In semi-arid Basin and Range systems, this impact is likely to be most pronounced in mountain system recharge (MSR), a process which constitutes a significant component of recharge in these basins. Despite its importance, the physical processes that control MSR have not been fully investigated because of limited observations and the complexity of recharge processes in mountainous catchments. As a result, empirical equations, that provide a basin-wide estimate of mean annual recharge using mean annual precipitation, are often used to estimate MSR. Here North American Regional Reanalysis data are used to develop seasonal recharge estimates using ratios of seasonal (winter vs. summer) precipitation to seasonal actual or potential evapotranspiration. These seasonal recharge estimates compared favorably to seasonal MSR estimates using the fraction of winter vs. summer recharge determined from isotopic data in the Upper San Pedro River Basin, Arizona. Development of hydrologically based seasonal ratios enhanced seasonal recharge predictions and notably allows evaluation of MSR response to changes in seasonal precipitation and temperature because of climate variability and change using Global Climate Model (GCM) climate projections. Results show that prospective variability in MSR depends on GCM precipitation predictions and on higher temperature. Lower seasonal MSR rates projected for 20502099 are associated with decreases in summer precipitation and increases in winter temperature.

We hypothesized that plots exposed to exogenous N should exhibit signs of N enrichment once a cumulative N exposure threshold was reached and the N immobilization capacity was exceeded.

This recent range expansion from west of the North American continental divide into the eastern boreal forest threatens to provide a conduit to naive pine hosts in eastern North America. We examine the initial expansion events and determine potential mechanism(s) of spread by comparing spread patterns in consecutive years to various dispersal hypotheses such as: (1) meso-scale atmospheric dispersal of insects from source populations south-west of the Rocky Mountains in British Columbia (i.e. their historical range), (2) anthropogenic transport of infested plant material, and (3) spread of insect populations across adjacent stands via corridors of suitable habitat.

Methods We explore potential mechanism(s) of invasion of the mountain pine beetle using spatial point process models for the initial 3 years of landscape-level data collection, 2004-2006. Specifically, we examine observed patterns of infestation relative to covariates reflecting various dispersal hypotheses. We select the most parsimonious models for each of the initial 3 years of invasion using information criteria statistics. Results The initial range expansion and invasion of the beetle was characterized by aerial deposition along a strong north-west to south-east gradient, with additional aerial deposition and localized dispersal from persisting populations in following years.

A critical elevation zone, where temperatures, snow cover, and the fraction of basin area are high is hypothesized to dominate melt volumes during peak discharge events. The distribution of snowmelt by elevation zone was documented during five peak discharge events in the Merced River Basin, California, using daily MODIS snow covered area (SCA) and a temperature-based melt model. The model successfully reproduced the spatial pattern in runoff measured at two stream gauges. SCA changed rapidly during several events, so daily SCA was essential for accurate estimation of melt, even for periods as short as 6 days. For all events, between 60% and 80% of melt volume occurred in an elevation zone that covered between 22% and 38% of total basin relief. The elevation of the critical zone increased through the melt season, and the center of mass of melt increased from 2425 m in March events to 3093 m in May events. For several events in March and April, the critical zone coincided with a large, flat upland area that covers a significant fraction of the watershed area. Early in the season, the critical zone occurred at a higher elevation than the intermittent area of rapidly changing snow cover, while later in the season the critical zone coincided with an area of rapidly changing snow cover. Forest cover impacted the total volume of melt, but had small effects on the relative distribution of melt among the zones. The critical-zone concept could be used to interpret and predict regional patterns in snowmelt flood peaks based on catchment hypsometry and climate. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The RCMs are evaluated with a clear RCM output user's perspective and a main focus on snow. Snow water equivalent (SWE) and snow duration, as well as air temperature and precipitation from five RCMs, are compared with snowpack telemetry (SNOTEL) observations, with National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP)-National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Reanalysis II (R2), which provides the boundary conditions for the RCM simulations, and with North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR). Overall, most RCMs were able to significantly improve on the results from the NCEP-NCAR reanalysis. However, in comparison with spatially aggregated point observations and NARR, the RCMs are generally too dry, too warm, simulate too little SWE, and have a too-short snow cover duration with a too-late start and a too-early end of a significant snow cover. The intermodel biases found are partly associated with inadequately resolved topography (at the spatial resolution of the RCMs), imperfect observational data, different forcing techniques (spectral nudging versus no nudging), and the different land surface schemes (LSS).

Restoration of fire disturbance to these forests is a guiding principle of resource management in the U.S. National Park Service. Policy implementation is often hindered by a poor understanding of forest conditions before fire exclusion, the characteristics of forest changes since excluding fire, and the influence of topographic or self-organizing controls on forest structure. In this study the spatial and temporal characteristics of fire regimes and forest structure are reconstructed in a 2125-ha mixed-conifer forest. Forests were multi-aged, burned frequently at low severity and fire-return interval, and forest structure did not vary with slope aspect, elevation, or slope position. Fire exclusion has caused an increase in forest density and basal area and a compositional shift to shade-tolerant and fire-intolerant species. The median point fire-return interval and extent of a fire was 10 yr and 115 ha, respectively. The pre-Euro-American settlement fire rotation of 13 yr increased to 378 yr after 1905. The position of tire scars within tree rings indicates that 79% of fires burned in the midsummer to fall period. The spatial pattern of burns exhibited self-organizing behavior. Area burned was 10-fold greater when an area had not been burned by the previous fire. Fires were frequent and widespread, but patches of similar aged trees were <0.2 ha, suggesting small fire-caused canopy openings. Managers need to apply multiple burns at short intervals for a sustained period to reduce surface fuels and create small canopy openings characteristic of the reference forest.

Here geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing tools are used to develop simple predictive models that define relationships between watershed variables known to influence lake DOC concentrations and lake water color in the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness in Montana and Wyoming, USA.

We explore this issue for the well-documented glaciers of Mount Baker in the Cascades Mountains of Washington State, USA, using glacier histories, glacier modeling, weather data and numerical weather model output. We find that natural variability alone is capable of producing kilometer-scale excursions in glacier length on multi-decadal and centennial timescales. Such changes are similar in magnitude to those attributed to a global Little Ice Age. The null hypothesis, that no climate change is required to explain the glacier fluctuations in this setting, cannot be rejected. These results for Mount Baker glaciers are also consistent with an earlier study analyzing individual glaciers in Scandinavia and the Alps. The principle that long-timescale fluctuations of glacier length can be driven by short-timescale fluctuations in climate reflects a robust and fundamental property of stochastically forced physical systems with memory. It is very likely that this principle also applies to other Alpine glaciers and that it therefore complicates interpretations of the relationship between glacier and climate history. However, the amplitude and timescale of the length fluctuations depends on the details of the particular glacier geometry and climatic setting, and this remains largely unevaluated for most glaciers.",2009,,Physical Geography; Geology,WOS:000273676200012,Courtney,No,Yes,No,Landscape/State-Province,glaciers in the Cascades,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Adrienne,No,Yes,No,Mt Baker,

The colonized roots from 40 individuals were examined using culture-dependent sequencing and ARISA (automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis). Our results demonstrated that high elevation fungal communities, characterised by Rhizoscyphus ericae, differ from lower elevation communities, where Phialocephala fortinii was the most frequently isolated fungus.

In order for future studies to assess snowpack variability on seasonal to centennial time scales, physically based models of snowpack evolution at high spatial resolution must be improved. Here we evaluate modeled snowpack accuracy for the central Sierra Nevada in the Weather Research and Forecasting regional climate model coupled to the Noah land surface model. A simulation with nested domains at 27, 9, and 3 km grid spacings is presented for November 2001 to July 2002. Model outputs are compared with daily snowpack observations at 41 locations, air temperature at 31 locations, and precipitation at 10 locations. Comparison of snowpack at different resolutions suggests that 27 km simulations substantially underestimate snowpack, while 9 and 3 km simulations are closer to observations. Regional snowpack accumulation is accurately simulated at these high resolutions, but model snowmelt occurs an average of 22-25 days early. Some error can be traced to differences in elevation and observation scale between point-based measurements and model grid cells, but these factors cannot explain the persistent bias toward early snowmelt. A high correlation between snowmelt and error in modeled surface air temperature is found, with melt coinciding systematically with excessively cold air temperatures.

We compare historical RCM simulations and simulations from their host global general circulation models (GCMs) to one-eighth degree gridded observations of precipitation, surface air temperature, and runoff (generated by the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) land surface model forced with gridded observations) for the historical period 1970-1999. The RCMs capture the primary features of observations better than their host GCMs in part because of their ability to better represent strong upward lift in topographically complex regions. Although the RCMs do not significantly improve the simulation of precipitation, their ability to better represent surface temperature in mountainous regions has important effects on simulations of evapotranspiration, snowpack, and runoff. In the Colorado River basin, projected mid-21st century runoff changes are mostly impacted by the combination of snow cover change in winter, temperature change in spring, and precipitation change in summer. In particular, the response of cold season temperatures in headwater streams is key to determining the basin's susceptibility to a warming climate. Because of the cooler temperature and higher snowline in RCMs relative to GCMs, the RCMs project less warming in the spring and thus generate smaller decreases in runoff, both during spring and annually, as compared with GCMs. Changes in surface air temperature, runoff, and snow water equivalent at high elevations all indicate that headwater streams of the Colorado River are less susceptible to a warming climate in climate change simulations that use RCMs than in simulations that use GCMs. Nonetheless, the 50 km NARCCAP grid resolution has some limitations in resolving orographic effects, which suggests that there may remain residual biases in the climatic sensitivity of the RCM simulations.",2011,10.1029/2010JD015278,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,WOS:000292609100002,Danny,No,Yes,No,Landscape/State-Province,Colorado River Basin,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Adrienne,No,Maybe,No,,

Dry years typically have greater potential evapotranspiration (ET) due to warmer June and July air temperatures, warmer summer water/soil temperatures, greater solar radiation exposure due to less frequent cloud cover, greater vapor pressure deficit, and longer growing seasons. However, dry years also have limited moisture availability compared to wetter years, and thus actual evapotranspiration is much less than the potential in dry years. The balance of these factors varies with elevation. Here, we use gridded temperature, precipitation, and snow data, along with historic streamflow records in two nested basins of the Merced River, California, and a simple model to determine the following: Annual ET increases in wetter years at midelevations (2100-2600 m), but this pattern can only be represented in model simulations that include some representation of water transfer between higher and lower elevation soil reservoirs. At higher elevations (>2600 m), greater water availability in wet years is offset by shorter growing seasons due to longer snow cover duration. These results suggest that models seeking to represent changes in ET in mountainous terrain must, at a minimum, include both hillslope processes (water transfer down steep slopes) and snow processes (timing of water and energy supply).",2011,10.1029/2010WR010050,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Water Resources,WOS:000291111100014,Danny,No,Yes,No,Ecosystem/Municipal,Sierra Nevada,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Adrienne,No,Maybe,No,,

In mountainous regions, the topography steers glaciers through relatively narrow and steep valleys, and as a consequence hereof, the flow rate of alpine-style glaciers varies significantly at length scales comparable to that of the topography. Localized flow rate undulations generate longitudinal and transverse stress gradients within the ice, which, in turn, are of known importance to the flow itself, whether by internal deformation of the ice or by basal sliding, and to the interaction with topography through glacial erosion. Standard models capable of simulating mountain range–scale glaciations build on the so-called shallow ice approximation, which, among other parameters, neglects the longitudinal and transverse stress gradients, and therefore fails to capture the full effects of the rugged topography and related feedbacks between erosion by glacial sliding and the extent and style of glaciation. Here we present and test a new depth-integrated model framework which, on the one hand, takes into account the “higher-order” effects related to steep and rugged bed topography while it still, on the other hand, provides the computational efficiency needed for three-dimensional simulations of glaciation and landscape evolution in response to, for example, long-term climate variations. The model framework (integrated second-order shallow ice approximation (iSOSIA)) is based on depth integration of the second-order shallow ice approximation. Although depth integration is not guaranteed to maintain so-called second-order accuracy, the results of computational benchmark experiments show that iSOSIA, in spite of its efficient depth-integrated structure, performs well in situations with steep and rapidly undulating bed topography.",2011,10.1029/2010JF001900,Geology,WOS:000290933700001,Danny,Maybe,No,No,plot/family/group,Steep Terrain,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Adrienne,No,Yes,No,Mathematical; no geography,

Survival was higher for fish that resided in pools with substantial cover than for fish that occupied pools with only partial or no concealment. Overall, the unexpectedly high survival rates of stranded kelts suggest that the rescue and relocation of stranded steelhead to other habitats or to hatcheries may only be warranted when there are clear imminent threats to survival.

This regional drying is part of a general drying of the subtropics and poleward expansion of the subtropical dry zones. Through an analysis of 15 coupled climate models it is shown here that the drying is driven by a reduction of winter season precipitation associated with increased moisture divergence by the mean flow and reduced moisture convergence by transient eddies. Due to the presence of large amplitude decadal variations of presumed natural origin, observations to date cannot confirm that this transition to a drier climate is already underway, but it is anticipated that the anthropogenic drying will reach the amplitude of natural decadal variability by midcentury. In addition to this drop in total precipitation, warming is already causing a decline in mountain snow mass and an advance in the timing of spring snow melt disrupting the natural water storage systems that are part of the region's water supply system. Uncertainties in how radiative forcing will impact the tropical Pacific climate system create uncertainties in the amplitude of drying in southwest North America with a La Nina-like response creating a worst case scenario of greater drying.",2010,10.1073/pnas.0910856107,Science & Technology - Other Topics,WOS:000285521500013,Danny,No,Yes,No,Biome/National,Southwestrrn Region,Shana,Yes,Yes,Yes,,Western US,NA,,,,,Adrienne,No,Yes,No,Southwestern US,

Along the Andes, the highest mountains and thickest crust (approximate to70 km) occur at 25degrees south, a region of low precipitation. Westerly winds warm passing over the Atacama Desert; precipitation is modest in the High Andes and eastward over the Altiplano. Severe aridity, hence low erosion rates, helps to account for the elevated volcanogenic contractional arc and high, internally draining plateau in its rain shadow. Weak erosion along the north-central arc provides scant amounts of sediment to the Chile-Peru Trench, starving the subduction channel. Subcrustal removal might be expected to reduce the crustal thickness, but is not a factor at 25degrees south. The thickness of the gravitationally compensated continental crust cannot reflect underplating and/or partial fusion of sediments, but must be caused chiefly by volcanism-plutonism and contraction. Contrasting climate typifies the terrane at 45degrees south where moisture-laden westerly winds encounter a cool margin, bringing abundant precipitation. The alpine landscape is of lower average elevation compared with the north-central Andes and is supported by thinner continental crust (approximate to35 km). Intense erosion supplies voluminous clastic debris to the offshore trench, and vast quantities are subducted. However, the southern Andean crust is only about half as thick as that at 25degrees south, suggesting that erosion, not subcrustal sediment accretion or anatexis, is partly responsible for the thickness of the mountain belt. The Himalayas plus Tibetan Plateau, the Sierra Nevada plus Colorado Plateau, and the Japanese Islands exhibit analogous relationships between crustal thickness and climate.",2004,10.1073/pnas.0406557101,Science & Technology - Other Topics,WOS:000224688700005,Meghan,Maybe,Maybe,No,Global/International,All young mountians including the Sierra Nevadas and Cascades,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Adrienne,Maybe,No,No,Not about climate change; basic geology,

Recent changes in the timing of environmental events attributable to climate change, such as the date of snowmelt at high altitudes, which initiates the growing season, have had important repercussions for some common perennial herbaceous wildflower species. The phenology of flowering at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory (Colorado, USA) is strongly influenced by date of snowmelt, which makes this site ideal for examining phenological responses to climate change. Flower buds of Delphinium barbeyi, Erigeron speciosus, and Helianthella quinquenervis are sensitive to frost, and the earlier beginning of the growing season in recent years has exposed them to more frequent mid-June frost kills. From 1992 to 1998, on average 36.1% of Helianthella buds were frosted, but for 1999-2006 the mean is 73.9%; in only one year since 1998 have plants escaped all frost damage. For all three of these perennial species, there is a significant relationship between the date of snowmelt and the abundance of flowering that summer. Greater snowpack results in later snowmelt, later beginning of the growing season, and less frost mortality of buds. Microhabitat differences in snow accumulation, snowmelt patterns, and cold air drainage during frost events can be significant; an elevation difference of only 12 m between two plots resulted in a temperature difference of almost 2 degrees C in 2006 and a difference of 37% in frost damage to buds. The loss of flowers and therefore seeds can reduce recruitment in these plant populations, and affect pollinators, herbivores, and seed predators that previously relied on them. Other plant species in this environment are similarly susceptible to frost damage so the negative effects for recruitment and for consumers dependent on flowers and seeds could be widespread. These findings point out the paradox of increased frost damage in the face of global warming, provide important insights into the adaptive significance of phenology, and have general implications for flowering plants throughout the region and anywhere climate change is having similar impacts.",2008,10.1890/06-2128.1,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WOS:000254124200008,Meghan,No,Yes,No,,CO,NA,,,,,,Courtney,No,,No,Rocky Mountain Biological Laborator,Adrienne,No,Maybe,No,,

In this study, we establish a generalized late Quaternary (i.e., 0-300 ka) varnish layering sequence for the drylands of western USA and tentatively correlate it with the SPECMAP oxygen isotope record. We then use this climatically correlated varnish layering sequence as a correlative dating tool to determine surface exposure ages for late Quaternary geomorphic features in the study region. VML dating of alluvial fan deposits in Death Valley of eastern California indicates that, during the mid to late Pleistocene, 5-15 ky long aggradation events occurred during either wet or dry climatic periods and that major climate shifts between glacial and interglacial conditions may be the pacemaker for alteration of major episodes of fan aggradation. During the Holocene interglacial time, however, 0.5-1 ky long brief episodes of fan deposition may be linked to short periods of relatively wet climate. VML dating of alluvial desert pavements in Death Valley and the Mojave Desert reveals that pavements can be developed rapidly (< 10 ky) during the Holocene (and probably late Pleistocene) in the and lowlands (< 800 m msl) of these regions; but once formed, they may survive for 74-85 ky or even longer without being significantly disturbed by geomorphic processes operative at the pavement surface. Data from this study also support the currently accepted, ""being born at the surface"" model of desert pavement formation. VML dating of colluvial boulder deposits on the west slope of Yucca Mountain, southern Nevada, yields a minimum age of 46 ka for the emplacement of these deposits on the slope, suggesting that they were probably formed during the early phase of the last glaciation or before. These results, combined with those from our previous studies, demonstrate that VML dating has great potential to yield numerical age estimates for various late Quaternary geomorphic features in the western USA drylands.

Features in different areas of the basin are well defined, and their spatial extents are easily mapped; however, absolute-or even relative-ages of shoreline features are not clear. Ground penetrating radar (GPR) was used to distinguish between intermediate and highstand stage shorelines during what is thought to have been the latest Pleistocene, threshold-controlled lake cycle. Radar transects of 280 and 600 m imaged a spit and a baymouth barrier at sites in the northeastern quadrant of the basin where transects were aligned normal to the strike of each depositional geomorphic feature. Signal penetration with 100 MHz antennas was shallow (similar to 4 m), but resolution was sufficient to locate and identify gross morphostratigraphic features. Flooding surfaces are shown to correspond to intermediate stage lake surface elevations, and the absence of a flooding surface at the elevation of the highest shoreline indicates this to be the maximum lake surface elevation during this cycle. Elevations of intermediate lake stage elevations and highstand stage elevations were consistent at the two sites, with the highstand elevations corresponding closely to the basin threshold at Big Sand Gap.

The lake rose rapidly in the late seventeenth century to a level 12 m above present, drowning forest and stranding driftwood on a conspicuous high-stand beach, remnants of which are preserved at the south end of the lake. Kluane Lake fell back to near its present level by the end of the eighteenth century and has fluctuated within a range of about 3 m over the last 50 yr. The primary control on historic fluctuations in take level is the discharge of Slims River, the largest source of water to the lake. We use tree ring and radiocarbon ages, stratigraphy and sub-bottom acoustic data to evaluate two explanations for the dramatic changes in the level of Kluane Lake. Our data support the hypothesis of Hugh Bostock, who suggested in 1969 that the maximum Little Ice Age advance of Kaskawulsh Glacier deposited large amounts of sediment in the Slims River valley and established the present course of Slims River into Kluane Lake. Bostock argued that these events caused the lake to rise and eventually overflow to the north. The overflowing waters incised the Duke River fan at the north end of Kluane Lake and lowered the lake to its present level.

We use a quantitative description of local fluvial landscapes to estimate how glaciated landscapes might look now had glaciers not developed. This indicates the landscape modification attributable to glacial erosion. We present examples from the Sierra Nevada, California and the Sangre de Cristo Range, Colorado. In smaller drainage basins, glacial modification is focussed above the mean Quaternary equilibrium line altitude (ELA), where both ridgelines and valley floors have been lowered as a consequence of glaciation. At lower elevations, small glaciers have apparently widened valleys without incising the valley floor beyond what a river would have. This may reflect the short residence time of the glaciers at their full extent, or differences in the subglacial drainage network between the glacier margins and the thalweg. In larger drainage basins, the pattern of glacial erosion is dramatically different. Here, the glaciers have modified longitudinal profiles, as well as valley cross sections, far below the mean Quaternary ELA. Possible causes of this difference in the larger basins include the larger accumulation area, greater shading of the valley floor, longer residence times for ice at its full extent, and the influence of the shallower valley slope prior to glaciation on the subsequent glacier and subglacial drainage conditions.

Macrofossil records from middens are playing particularly important roles in documenting spatial and temporal patterns of plant migrations and invasions since the last glacial maximum 21,000 years ago. However, relatively few actualistic studies comparing contents of modern middens with surrounding flora and vegetation have been carried out. The primary aim of this study is to assess the reliability of midden assemblages in detecting the presence of tree, shrub and several other plant species growing on the surrounding landscape. The secondary aims are to determine whether probability of occurrence of species in middens is related to abundance in vegetation, and whether representation of individual species in middens is contingent on presence/absence or abundance of other species. Location Our five study sites were bedrock escarpments or canyons in the central Rocky Mountains (north-eastern Utah, central Wyoming and south-central Montana). All sites were in conifer woodland or forest/woodland variously dominated by Juniperus osteosperma, J. scopulorum, Pinus edulis, P. flexilis and Pseudotsuga menziesii. Neotoma cinerea is the only woodrat species in the region. Methods Macrofossil assemblages from 59 modern middens (all showing clear signs of recent or ongoing woodrat activity) were compared with floristic composition of vegetation within 50 m of the middens, and with percent cover of vegetation within 30 m of the middens. Results Coniferous trees and shrubs were well-represented in middens, occurring consistently even when abundance in the local vegetation was very low. Juniperus osteosperma and J. scopulorum were particularly well-represented, occurring in middens regardless of local abundance. Other conifers (P. edulis, P. flexilis, P. ponderosa, Pseudotsuga menziesii) were occasionally absent from middens when abundance in vegetation was low (< 20% canopy cover). Occurrence of dicot shrubs and graminoids was less consistent. Main conclusions Middens constructed by N. cinerea are highly reliable sensors of presence/absence of J. osteosperma and J. scopulorum, and hence can be used to infer invasions and past biogeographical distributions of these species.

Vegetation on contrasting geologic substrates in 58, 50 x 50 m sites was studied annually in early July and in late September 1997-2001. We quantified areal abundances of plant species by using field inventories and ground-based values of the normalized-difference vegetation index (NDVI). Distributions and abundances of species are complex functions of microclimate (elevation, slope, and facing direction), seasonality, soil development, bedrock lithologies, and albedo. X-ray diffraction studies demonstrate that the soils consist chiefly of in situ weathering components such as illite, montmorillonite, chlorite, quartz, carbonates, and feldspars. Soils along higher ridges contain modest amounts of wind-blown grains derived from glaciated granodioritic plutons and volcanic roof pendants of the Sierra Nevada. Light-colored limestone and dolomite support only sparse amounts of Sagebrush at any altitude, whereas this drought-tolerant species is widespread on dark argillite, quartzite, phyllite, and granitic rocks. Grasses grow luxuriantly on dark granite and quartzite, but poorly on carbonate bedrock. Trees are numerous on carbonate rocks, but are uncommon on dark granite and quartzite. Higher-albedo rocks and soils retain moisture better than darker substrates and in general support greater vegetative cover and biomass. These studies provided ground control for hyperspectral data collected by ER-2 aircraft along three Airborne Visible and InfraRed Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) flight lines. Because of the similar to16 m spatial resolution of the remotely sensed data, only plant communities could be mapped from AVIRIS imagery. On the basis of the dominant species, we identified the following communities: Shadscale/desert scrub; Pinyon-Juniper woodlands; Sagebrush meadows; Mountain Mahogany woodlands; Aspen woodlands; Bristlecone Pine-Limber Pine woodlands; and Alpine fell-fields. When judged by correlation with the 50 x 50 m ground-based inventoried sites, botanical community assignments for the June 2000 flight lines achieved an accuracy of 81%; in contrast, October 1996 assignments were only 65% correct, reflecting low sun angle and senesced vegetation.",2003,10.1130/B25205.1,Geology,WOS:000187010400010,Meghan,No,Maybe,No,,,Meghan,,,No,,,NA,,,,,Adrienne,No,Maybe,No,California/Nevada,

We sought to describe the pattern of genetic variation across the range of this species, to determine whether there were detectable genetic differences between D. ponderosae occupying different host trees in common localities, and to determine whether there was molecular evidence for a past demographic expansion. Using a combination of amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and mitochondrial sequencing analyses, we found evidence of genetic structuring among populations that followed a broad isolation-by-distance pattern. Our results suggest that the geographical pattern of gene flow follows the core distribution of the principal D. ponderosae host species, around rather than across the Great Basin and Mojave Deserts. Patterns of haplotype diversity and divergence were consistent with a range-wide population expansion. This signal was particularly pronounced in the northern part of the species' range, where outbreak activity is currently increasing. Using AFLP markers, we were unable to detect significant differences among groups of insects sampled from different host trees in common locations. Incidentally, we found that a large proportion of the polymorphic AFLP markers were gender-specific, occurring only in males.

None of the 200 species is extinct. In contrast to this, only 8% of 73 identified mammal species from Rocky Mountain Late Pleistocene assemblages are no longer resident in the Rockies, and 12 species are now extinct. Since both groups of organisms are highly mobile, it would appear that their responses to the large-scale fluctuations of climate associated with the last 125,000 years have been considerably different. Most strikingly contrasting with the insects, there are no mammals in the Rocky Mountain Late Pleistocene fossil record that are found exclusively today in the Pacific Northwest (PNW) region. The PNW does have a distinctive modern mammalian fauna, but only one of these, Keen's Myotis, has a fossil record outside the PNW region, in the eastern and central United States. No modern PNW vertebrate species have been found in any Rocky Mountain fossil assemblages. Based on these data, it appears that there has been little or no mammalian faunal exchange between the PNW region and the Rocky Mountains during the Late Pleistocene or Holocene. This is in stark contrast to the fossil beetle record, where PNW species are a substantial component in many faunas, right through to the Late Holocene. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Results published to date by many researchers clearly show that there was a tight temporal coupling between Aptian-Albian marine, atmospheric, and terrestrial carbon pools that now permits refined global chemostratigraphic and chronostratigraphic correlations on time scales of 106 years or less. This development opens new opportunities to explore the Aptian-Albian Earth system by incorporating continental climate change dynamics in a developing global synthesis. In this paper, we present new U-Pb and U-Th/He age dates on a late Albian volcanic ash deposit in a stratigraphic section that fills a previous gap in in the terrestrial delta C-13 record. Here we also present, for the first time, coordinated delta C-13(carbonate), delta O-18(carbonate), and delta C-13(organic) data from stacked successions of paleosols in Aptian-Albian terrestrial strata of the Cedar Mountain Formation of Utah, USA. From the whole of this record, the late Aptian C10 C-isotope feature is especially noteworthy as an interval of major global change. Coordinated carbonate and organic carbon isotope data from this interval suggest that this positive carbon isotope excursion (CIE) was related to a buildup of atmospheric pCO(2) to a peak level of about 1200 ppmV over a period of several million years duration, above earlier Aptian baseline levels of about 1000 ppmV. The C10 interval was immediately preceded and followed by drawdowns in pCO(2) to levels of about 800 ppmV, and the entirety of the Aptian-Albian record from the Cedar Mountain Formation suggests a long-term fall of pCO2 levels from about 1000 down to 600 ppmV. We suggest that the late Aptian buildup likely is related to submarine volcanic activity in the Kerguelen Large Igneous Province in the southern Indian Ocean. Strata of the C-10 C-isotope feature are also associated with sedimentary evidence for an aridification event in the leeward rain shadow of the Sevier Mountains. On the basis of diagenetic studies of dolomitized calcretes in this C10 interval, we calculate that the precipitation-evaporation deficit intensified to the extent that 35-50% of the shallow groundwater system was lost to the atmosphere through evaporation.

The basin was instrumented in 1962, subjected to forestry experiments in the mid-1970s, and experienced extreme flooding in 2013. Climate change, forest cover change, and recent extreme weather make the basin an ideal laboratory for studying hydrological resilience. Observations show increases in low elevation air temperature, multiple day and spring precipitation, interannual variability of precipitation, and high elevation groundwater levels. Observations also show decreases in peak seasonal snow accumulation and low elevation groundwater levels. Despite these substantial hydrometeorological and groundwater changes, streamflow volume, timing of peak, and magnitude of the peak are not changing. Streamflow volumes are also insensitive to forest cover changes and teleconnections. The June 2013 flood was unprecedented in the period of record, and the basin significantly moderated the hydrological response to the extreme precipitation; the 2013 storm precipitation depth was 65% greater than the next highest storm total over 51years; however, the 2013 peak streamflow was only 32% greater than the next highest peak flow recorded.

Beyond the recognized pattern of increasing fire frequency in the Sierra Nevada since the late 20th century, we find that the upper elevation extent of those fires has also been increasing. Factors such as fire season climate and fuel build up are recognized potential drivers of changes in fire regimes. Patterns of warming climate and increasing stand density are consistent with both the direction and magnitude of increasing elevation of wildfire. Reduction in high elevation wildfire suppression and increasing ignition frequencies may also contribute to the observed pattern. Historical biases in fire reporting are recognized, but not likely to explain the observed patterns. The four plausible mechanistic hypotheses (changes in fire management, climate, fuels, ignitions) are not mutually exclusive, and likely have synergistic interactions that may explain the observed changes.

Observed snow accumulation was 30% lower on average and snow melted out 16 days earlier in the heated plots compared to the controls. Soil temperature during snowmelt was 3 degrees C greater on average and soil moisture was 4% lower on average in heated plots compared to controls. In NM, snow accumulation was 23% lower, snow melted 23 days earlier, soil temperature was 0.6 degrees C greater, and soil moisture was 13% lower on average relative to CO controls. In order to estimate differences in energy and mass balance fluxes at the snow-atmosphere interface in control versus warmer plots, the 1-D, physically based snowmelt model, SNOWPACK, was used. Model results indicated that heaters alter radiative, turbulent and mass fluxes by amounts comparable to the differences between CO and NM fluxes. The proportion of the energy flux associated with latent heat exchange during snowmelt was 9-27% of the total energy flux in heated models and 19-22% of NM models compared to 3-7% in control models. Thus, sublimation loss to the atmosphere was greater in both experimentally and naturally warmer cases relative to the control case. We conclude that IR heaters can provide alterations to the timing and magnitude of snow accumulation and snowmelt consistent with conditions observed at a warmer analog site and with climate and hydrology model projections. Impacts of IR heating on energy partitioning and sublimation should be considered when designing manipulations of the snowpack, as reductions in snowmelt water may alter biological or ecological processes.

Abstract This study investigated historical climate trends in northern British Columbia, Canada, through the use of tree-ring proxies, and established a means of reconstructing intra-annual climate patterns from wood density, fibre properties and tree-ring width data. Specific attention was given to investigating how dendroclimatological analyses of intra-ring wood and fibre properties could be interpreted to improve the strength of proxy climate records. Trees were sampled at six sites in northern British Columbia. Spruce trees were collected from the Smithers area, whilst Douglas-fir trees were sampled at the northern latitudinal extent of their range near Babine and Francois Lakes, and at a precipitation-limited site near Valemount. Wood cores were analysed by Windendro (R) software with an ITRAX scanning densitometer, and by the SilviScan system located at the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Research Organization. A mean June temperature proxy record dating to 1805 and a July-August mean temperature proxy record for Smithers extending from 1791 to 2006 were constructed from spruce ring width and maximum density chronologies. Douglas-fir ring width, spruce minimum density, and Douglas-fir maximum cell-wall thickness chronologies were used to reconstruct a May-June precipitation record extending from 1820 to 2006, and a July-August total precipitation record for Fort St. James that extends from 1912 to 2006.

The current study examines temporal variability in tree mortality based on monitoring >5000 permanently marked trees across a range of topographic positions and stand ages from c. 120 to >550 years over a 31-year period in subalpine forests in the Colorado Front Range. This study documents accelerating rates of annual tree mortality for subalpine fir, Engelmann spruce, lodgepole pine, and limber pine from 1982 through 2013. Over the period from 1982 to 2013, annual mortality rates for all tree species combined increased from 0.36% to 1.03% in old stands (265 to >550 years since stand-initiating fires) and from 0.30% to 0.72% in young stands (120 years since fire). Tree populations at sites of topographically moister locations and where competition was less due to presence of canopy openings, experienced initially lower rates of tree mortality but all populations experienced higher mortality rates after c. 2008. In comparison with the 1953-1994 period, the frequency of extreme high temperatures in early summer increased after the mid-1970s and more markedly after 2000. Over time, the contribution of early summer (July) conditions to annual drought has increased. This pattern of climatic variability has been coincident with and conducive to a two and a half fold increase in the average annualized tree mortality rates for the total tracked tree population from the relatively cool and wet 1982-1994 period to the warmer and drier 2008-2013 period. Tree mortality attributable to bark beetles over the 1982-2013 period was minor, except for western balsam bark beetle (Dryocoetes confusus) which since 2008 has accounted for about 12% of the subalpine fir deaths. Overall, our findings indicate that even in the absence of lethal bark beetle outbreaks conifer mortality, apparently associated with moisture stress, has recently increased in subalpine forests in the Colorado Front Range.

Ignited in July, this fire ultimately spread to 11,283 ha and cost USD $18.5 million to contain and extinguish. Priority was placed on protecting various private landholdings within the National Forest and on its periphery, which included several seasonal, high-value vacation homes. Nuwuvi (Southern Paiute) consider the Spring Mountains landscape in Nevada to be their creation place and the center of their ancestral territory. Their oral history states that the Creator charged them with balancing the land, which is sentient and considered a close relative, at different points in time. This relationship includes a fire management model that creates small-scale landscape disturbances such as patch burns and fuels reduction, and protects fire-resilient trees. Assembling together ethnographic and United States Census data and literature, we argue that a decrease in indigenous fire management and a concurrent increase in fire suppression through Forest Service policy, old growth timber harvest, grazing, the introduction of nonnative invasive species, and private landholdings facilitated the unprecedented size and intensity of this wildfire.

We use a simplified glacier model to evaluate its future mass loss. In a first step we compute glacier-wide mass change with a surface mass-balance model, and add a mass loss component due to ice flux through the calving front. We then use an empirical elevation change curve to adjust for surface elevation change of the glacier and finally use a flotation criterion to account for terminus retreat due to frontal ablation. Surface mass balance is computed on a daily timescale; elevation change and retreat is adjusted on a decadal scale. We use two scenarios to simulate future mass change: (1) keeping the current (2000-10) climate and (2) forcing the model with a projected warming climate. We find that the glacier will disappear in the decade before 2110 or 2070 under constant or warming climates, respectively. For the first few decades, the glacier can maintain its current thinning rates by retreating and associated loss of high-ablating, low-elevation areas. However, once higher elevations have thinned substantially, the glacier can no longer counteract accelerated thinning by retreat and mass loss accelerates, even under constant climate conditions. We find that it would take a substantial cooling of 1.5 degrees C to reverse the ongoing retreat.

In British Columbia, Canada, Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) is the most prevalent host, and records show that significant outbreaks have primarily occurred in the southern interior over the last century. In the central interior of British Columbia, particularly in the Cariboo Forest Region, the most recent outbreak of western spruce budworm, which is in its second decade, has been severe and widespread. It is perhaps due to this long outbreak, which is unprecedented in duration since detailed surveys began in the 1950s, that there is an anecdotal perception that the western spruce budworm is expanding its range northward into the region, affecting Douglas-fir near the edge of its northern distribution. However, very little is known about the long-term outbreak history of western spruce budworm in the central interior of the province. In this study we used 11 Douglas-fir host chronologies and 2 regional Finns non-host chronologies to reconstruct western spruce budworm outbreaks over a 435-year period. Standard dendrochronological techniques were used to develop tree-ring chronologies at each site and the program OUTBREAK was used to detect outbreak periods. We reconstructed 12 outbreaks starting in early 1600s with a mean return interval of 30 years. Sensitivity analysis illustrated that including light, moderate and severe intensity thresholds modified the number of reconstructed outbreaks, their duration and mean return interval. Sub-regional chronologies based on biogeoclimatic subzones and variants (BEC units), revealed strong synchrony of some outbreak events, but not all. Wavelet analysis of the sub-regional chronologies demonstrated the quasi-periodic behavior of western spruce budworm over the entire record, which averaged 32-years. By reconstructing WSB dynamics over 400 years we demonstrated that outbreaks observed over the last 40 years in the Cariboo Forest Region are not unprecedented.

The main aim of this research is to develop FSC estimation in complex alpine-forested environments using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) methodology as a fusion framework between multi-sensor remotely sensed data at medium temporal/spatial resolution (e.g.16-day revisit time; 30 m; Landsat), and high spatial resolutions (e.g.1 m; IKONOS). This research is the first known attempt to develop a multi-scale estimator of FSC from surface equivalent reference data derived from IKONOS multispectral data. It is also the first endeavor to estimate FSC values by combining terrain and snow/non-snow reflectance data. The plasticity of the developed ANN Landsat-FSC model accommodates alpine-forest heterogeneity, and renders unbiased, comprehensive, and precise FSC estimates. The accuracy of the ANN Landsat based FSC is characterized by: (1) very low error values (mean error similar to 0.0002; RMSE similar to 0.10; MAE similar to 0.08 FSC), (2) high correlation with the ground equivalent reference datasets derived from I m resolution IKONOS images (r(2) similar to 0.9), and (3) robust FSC estimation that is independent of terrain/vegetation alpine heterogeneity. The latter is supported by a spatially uniform distribution of errors, and lack of correlation between terrain (slope, aspect, terrain shadow distribution), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, and the error (r(2) = 0).

Early work by AD. Hopkins suggested that when alternate host species are available, MPB will prefer to breed in the host to which it has become adapted. In Colorado, epidemic MPB populations that originated in lodgepole pine expanded into mixed-conifer stands containing ponderosa pine, a related host. We evaluated the susceptibility of both hosts to successful MPB colonization in a survey of 19 sites in pine-dominated mixed-conifer stands spanning 140 km of the Front Range, CO, USA. In each of three 0.2-ha plots at each site, we (1) assessed trees in the annual flights of 2008-2011 to compare MPB-caused mortality between lodgepole and ponderosa pine; (2) recorded previous MPB-caused tree mortality from 2004-2007 to establish baseline mortality levels; and (3) measured characteristics of the stands (e.g. tree basal area) and sites (e.g. elevation, aspect) that might be correlated with MPB colonization. Uninfested average live basal area of lodgepole and ponderosa pine was 74% of total basal area before 2004. We found that for both species, annual percent basal area of attacked trees was greatest in one year (2009), and was lower in all other years (2004-2007, 2008, 2010, and 2011). Both pine species had similar average total mortality of 38-39% by 2011. Significant predictors of ponderosa pine mortality in a given year were basal area of uninfested ponderosa pine and the previous year's mortality levels in both ponderosa and lodgepole pine. Lodgepole pine mortality was predicted by uninfested basal areas of both lodgepole and ponderosa pine, and the previous year's lodgepole pine mortality. These results indicate host selection by MPB from lodgepole pine natal hosts into ponderosa pine the following year, but not the reverse. In both species, diameters of attacked trees within each year were similar, and were progressively smaller the last four years of the study period. Our results suggest that, in contrast to previous reports, ponderosa and lodgepole pine were equally susceptible to MPB infestation in the CO Front Range during our study period. This suggests that forest managers may anticipate similar impacts in both hosts during similar environmental conditions when epidemic-level MPB populations are active in mixed-pine stands.

The aim of this study was to quantify the landscape-level drivers that explained the dynamic patterns of MPB mortality, and simulate areas with future potential MPB mortality under projected climate-change scenarios in Grand County, Colorado, USA. The outbreak patterns of MPB were characterized by analysis of a decade-long Landsat time-series stack, aided by automatic attribution of change detected by the Landsat-based Detection of Trends in Disturbance and Recovery algorithm (LandTrendr). The annual area of new MPB mortality was then related to a suite of anthropogenic, biologic, and physical predictor variables under a general linear model (GLM) framework. Data from years 2001-2005 were used to train the model and data from years 2006-2011 were retained for validation. After stepwise removal of non-significant predictors, the remaining predictors in the GLM indicated that neighborhood mortality, winter mean temperature anomaly, and residential housing density were positively associated with MPB mortality, whereas summer precipitation was negatively related. The final model had an average area under the curve (AUC) of a receiver operating characteristic plot value of 0.72 in predicting the annual area of new mortality for the independent validation years, and the mean deviation from the base maps in the MPB mortality areal estimates was around 5%. The extent of MPB mortality will likely expand under two climate-change scenarios (RCP 4.5 and 8.5) in Grand County, which implies that the impacts of MPB outbreaks on vegetation composition and structure, and ecosystem functioning are likely to increase in the future.

At an elevation of 2705 m, the Ziegler Reservoir fossil site also contained thousands of well-preserved bones of late Pleistocene megafauna, including mastodons, mammoths, ground sloths, horses, camels, deer, bison, black bear, coyotes, and bighorn sheep. In addition, the site contained more than 26,000 bones from at least 30 species of small animals including salamanders, otters, muskrats, minks, rabbits, beavers, frogs, lizards, snakes, fish, and birds.

Estimates of NSA were then used to explain the NO3- flushing behavior for each basin over a 12 year period (19962007). To identify the optimal method for defining NSAs and elucidate mechanisms underlying catchment NO3- flushing, we conducted a series of regression analyses using multiple thresholds of snowmelt based on temporal and volumetric metrics. NSA indices defined by volume of snowmelt (e.g., snowmelt <= 30 cm) rather than snowmelt duration (e.g., snowmelt <= 9 days) were the best predictors of stream NO3- concentrations. The NSA indices were better correlated with stream NO3- concentration in TOK (average R-2 = 0.68) versus GLV4 (average R-2 = 0.44). Positive relationships between NSA and stream NO3- concentration were observed in TOK with peak stream NO3- concentration occurring on the rising limb of snowmelt. Positive and negative relationships between NSA and stream NO3- concentration were found in GLV4 with peak stream NO3- concentration occurring as NSA expands. Consistent with previous works, the contrasting NO3- flushing behavior suggests that streamflow in TOK was primarily influenced by overland flow and shallow subsurface flow, whereas GLV4 appeared to be more strongly influenced by deeper subsurface flow paths.",2014,10.1002/2013WR015243,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Water Resources,WOS:000346654600018,Micah,No,Yes,No,,CO/CA,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Adrienne,No,Maybe,No,,

Using independent records of sea-level pressure (SLP), SST, and SAT, this study investigates northeast (NE) Pacific coupled atmosphere-ocean variability from 1900 to 2012, with emphasis on the coastal areas around North America. We use a linear stochastic time series model to show that the SST evolution around the NE Pacific coast can be explained by a combination of regional atmospheric forcing and ocean persistence, accounting for 63% of nonseasonal monthly SST variance (r = 0.79) and 73% of variance in annual means (r = 0.86). We show that SLP reductions and related atmospheric forcing led to century-long warming around the NE Pacific margins, with the strongest trends observed from 1910-1920 to 1940. NE Pacific circulation changes are estimated to account for more than 80% of the 1900-2012 linear warming in coastal NE Pacific SST and US Pacific northwest (Washington, Oregon, and northern California) SAT. An ensemble of climate model simulations run under the same historical radiative forcings fails to reproduce the observed regional circulation trends. These results suggest that natural internally generated changes in atmospheric circulation were the primary cause of coastal NE Pacific warming from 1900 to 2012 and demonstrate more generally that regional mechanisms of interannual and multidecadal temperature variability can also extend to century time scales.",2014,10.1073/pnas.1318371111,Science & Technology - Other Topics,WOS:000342633900029,Micah,No,Maybe,No,,NW Pacific Ocean,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Adrienne,No,Maybe,No,,

To shed light on factors contributing to background tree mortality, we analyzed detailed pathological data from 200,668 tree-years of observation and 3,729 individual tree deaths, recorded over a 13-yr period in a network of old-growth forest plots in California's Sierra Nevada mountain range. We found that: (1) Biotic mortality factors (mostly insects and pathogens) dominated (58%), particularly in larger trees (86%). Bark beetles were the most prevalent (40%), even though there were no outbreaks during the study period; in contrast, the contribution of defoliators was negligible. (2) Relative occurrences of broad classes of mortality factors (biotic, 58%; suppression, 51%; and mechanical, 25%) are similar among tree taxa, but may vary with tree size and growth rate. (3) We found little evidence of distinct groups of mortality factors that predictably occur together on trees. Our results have at least three sets of implications. First, rather than being driven by abiotic factors such as lightning or windstorms, the ambient or random background mortality that many forest models presume to be independent of tree growth rate is instead dominated by biotic agents of tree mortality, with potentially critical implications for forecasting future mortality. Mechanistic models of background mortality, even for healthy, rapidly growing trees, must therefore include the insects and pathogens that kill trees. Second, the biotic agents of tree mortality, instead of occurring in a few predictable combinations, may generally act opportunistically and with a relatively large degree of independence from one another. Finally, beyond the current emphasis on folivory and leaf defenses, studies of broad-scale gradients in the nature and strength of biotic interactions should also include biotic attacks on, and defenses of, tree stems and roots.",2016,10.1002/ecy.1497,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WOS:000386088000010,Paris,No,No,No,,CA,Becky,No,Yes,No,,California's Sierra Nevada mountain range,NA,,,,,Adrienne,No,Yes,No,,

In many areas, this has increased tree density and the proportion of shade-tolerant species, reduced resource availability, and increased forest susceptibility to forest insect pests and high-severity wildfire. In response, treatments are often implemented with the goal of increasing ecosystem resilience by increasing resistance to disturbance. We capitalized on an existing replicated study of fire and stand density treatments in a ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa)-Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) forest in western Montana, USA, that experienced a naturally occurring mountain pine beetle (MPB; Dendroctonus ponderosae) outbreak 5 yr after implementation of fuels treatments. We explored whether treatment effects on tree-level defense and stand structure affected resistance to MPB. Mortality from MPB was highest in the denser, untreated control and burn-only treatments, with approximately 50% and 39%, respectively, of ponderosa pine killed during the outbreak, compared to almost no mortality in the thin-only and thin-burn treatments. Thinning treatments, with or without fire, dramatically increased tree growth and resin ducts relative to control and burn-only treatments. Prescribed burning did not increase resin ducts but did cause changes in resin chemistry that may have affected MPB communication and lowered attack success. While ponderosa pine remained dominant in the thin and thin-burn treatments after the outbreak, the high pine mortality in the control and burn-only treatment caused a shift in species dominance to Douglas-fir. The high Douglas-fir component in the control and burn-only treatments due to 20th century fire exclusion, coupled with high pine mortality from MPB, has likely reduced resilience of this forest beyond the ability to return to a ponderosa pine-dominated system in the absence of further fire or mechanical treatment. Our results show treatments designed to increase resistance to high-severity fire in ponderosa pine-dominated forests in the Northern Rockies can also increase resistance to MPB, even during an outbreak. This study suggests that fuel and restoration treatments in fire-dependent ponderosa pine forests that reduce tree density increase ecosystem resilience in the short term, while the reintroduction of fire is important for long-term resilience.",2016,10.1002/eap.1363,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WOS:000385623900003,Paris,Yes,Yes,Yes,plot/family/group,,Shana,No,Yes,No,,Western Montana,NA,,,,,Adrienne,No,Yes,No,"central W montana, outside CRB",

Here we take an integrative high-resolution ensemble modeling approach to examine near term climate change impacts on all imported and local sources of water supply to Southern California. While annual precipitation is projected to remain the same or slightly increase, rising temperatures result in a shift towards more rainfall, reduced cold season snowpack and earlier snowmelt. Associated with these hydrological changes are substantial increases in the frequency and the intensity of both drier conditions and flooding events. The 50 year extreme daily maximum precipitation and runoff events are 1.5-6 times more likely to occur depending on the water supply basin. Simultaneously, a clear deficit in total annual runoff over mountainous snow generating regions like the Sierra Nevada is projected. On one hand, the greater probability of drought decreases imported water supply availability. On the other hand, earlier snowmelt and significantly stronger winter precipitation events pose increased flood risk requiring water releases from control reservoirs, which may potentially decrease water availability outside of the wet season.

To address the hydrological effects of climate-driven variations in snowpack on simulated forest dynamics, we added a simple snow accumulation-and-melt module to the vegetation model and compared simulations with and without the module. LANDCLIM produced realistic present-day species composition with respect to elevation and precipitation gradients. Over the last 16,000 years, simulations driven by transient climate data from an atmosphere-ocean general circulation model (AOGCM) and by a chironomid-based temperature reconstruction captured Late-glacial to Late Holocene transitions in forest communities. Overall, the reconstruction-driven vegetation simulations matched observed vegetation changes better than the AOGCM-driven simulations. This study also indicates that forest composition is very sensitive to snowpack-mediated changes in soil moisture. Simulations without the snow module showed a strong effect of snowpack on key bioclimatic variables and species composition at higher elevations.

We examined patterns of mortality, structure, and regeneration in whitebark pine stands impacted by mountain pine beetle in the southern Sierra Nevada. Mortality was greatest in medium to large diameter (>10-20 cm dbh) trees, resulting in declines in mean and maximum tree diameter and tree size class diversity following an outbreak. Severity of beetle attack was positively related to mean tree diameter and density.

Given the frequency of these events are expected to increase in the future, understanding patterns of mortality and plant response to severe drought is important to resource managers. Drought can affect the functional, physiological, structural, and demographic properties of forest ecosystems. Remote sensing studies have documented changes in forest properties due to direct and indirect effects of drought; however, few studies have addressed this at local scales needed to characterize highly heterogeneous ecosystems in the forest-shrubland ecotone. We analyzed a 22-year Landsat time series (1985-2012) to determine changes in forest in an area that experienced a relatively dry decade punctuated by two years of extreme drought. We assessed the relationship between several vegetation indices and field measured characteristics (e.g. plant area index and canopy gap fraction) and applied these indices to trend analysis to uncover the location, direction and timing of change. Finally, we assessed the interaction of climate and topography by forest functional type. The Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI), a measure of canopy water content, had the strongest correlation with short-term field measures of plant area index (R-2 = 0.64) and canopy gap fraction (R-2 = 0.65). Over the entire time period, 25% of the forested area experienced a significant (p-value < 0.05) negative trend in NDMI, compared to less than 10% in a positive trend. Coniferous forests were more likely to be associated with a negative NDMI trend than deciduous forest. Forests on southern aspects were least likely to exhibit a negative trend while north aspects were most prevalent. Field plots with a negative trend had a lower live density, and higher amounts of standing dead and down trees compared to plots with no trend. Our analysis identifies spatially explicit patterns of long-term trends anchored with ground based evidence to highlight areas of forest that are resistant, persistent or vulnerable to severe drought. The results provide a long-term perspective for the resource management of this area and can be applied to similar ecosystems throughout western North. America.

Aims: We synthesise the results of hydrological and hydrochemical studies during the period 1995-2014, building on a long history of earlier work focused on snow and water on Niwot Ridge and the adjacent Green Lakes Valley (GLV), which is part of the Niwot Ridge Long Term Ecological Research site (NWT LTER). Methods: These studies are discussed in the context of how snow, snowmelt and runoff reflect changing local climate. We review recent results of snow, snowmelt, hydrology and hydrochemistry from the plot to the basin scale, utilising new tools such as continuous global positioning system (GPS) measurements of snow depth, along with remotely-sensed measurements of snow-covered area and melt, combined with long-term measurements of snow properties, discharge and solute and isotopic content of water. Results and Conclusions: Surface-groundwater interactions are important components of water quantity and quality in alpine basins. Some or most snowmelt infiltrates underlying soils and bedrock, transporting soil and bedrock products to surface waters. Infiltrating snowmelt, along with increased melt of stored ice, increases the hydrologic connectivity between the terrestrial and aquatic systems. Alpine basins are being impacted by increases in atmospheric nitrogen deposition, which has caused changes in soil microbial processes such as nitrification. Nitrate, dissolved organic carbon and dissolved organic nitrogen are thus flushed from soils and talus to streams. Our long-term results show that alpine catchments, such as Green Lake 4 at NWT LTER+, have the greatest sensitivity and least resilience to climate warming, with any warming leading to increased water yields.",2015,10.1080/17550874.2015.1123318,Plant Sciences,WOS:000371707500003,Paris,No,Yes,No,,CO,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Adrienne,No,Yes,No,,

The El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) generates climatic extremes of interannual variation, and has been shown to have significant effects on the diversity and abundance of a variety of terrestrial taxa. However, studies that have investigated the influence of such large-scale climate phenomena have often been limited in spatial and taxonomic scope. We used 23 years (1988-2010) of a long-term butterfly monitoring data set to explore associations between variation in population abundance of 28 butterfly species and variation in ENSO-derived sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTA) across 10 sites that encompass an elevational range of 2750 m in the Sierra Nevada mountain range of California. Our analysis detected a positive, regional effect of increased SSTA on butterfly abundance (wetter and warmer years predict more butterfly observations), yet the influence of SSTA on butterfly abundances varied along the elevational gradient, and also differed greatly among the 28 species. Migratory species had the strongest relationships with ENSO-derived SSTA, suggesting that large-scale climate indices are particularly valuable for understanding biotic-abiotic relationships of the most mobile species. In general, however, the ecological effects of large-scale climatic factors are context dependent between sites and species. Our results illustrate the power of long-term data sets for revealing pervasive yet subtle climatic effects, but also caution against expectations derived from exemplar species or single locations in the study of biotic-abiotic interactions.",2015,10.1890/15-0661.1,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WOS:000365521600005,Paris,No,Yes,No,,CA,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Adrienne,No,Maybe,No,,

We used a provenance trial approach to examine microgeographic variation in local adaptation in Boechera stricta (Brassicaceae), a perennial forb native to the Rocky Mountains. In montane ecosystems, environmental conditions change considerably over short spatial scales, such that neighboring populations can be subject to different selective pressures. Using accessions from southern (Colorado) and northern (Idaho) populations, we characterized spatial variation in genetic similarity via microsatellite markers. We then transplanted genotypes from multiple local populations into common gardens in both regions. Continuous variation in local adaptation emerged for several components of fitness. In Idaho, genotypes from warmer environments (low-elevation or south-facing sites) were poorly adapted to the north-facing garden. In high- and low-elevation Colorado gardens, susceptibility to insect herbivory increased with source elevation. In the high-elevation Colorado garden, germination success peaked for genotypes that evolved at elevations similar to that of the garden and decreased for genotypes from higher and lower elevations. We also found evidence for local maladaptation in survival and fecundity components of fitness in the low-elevation Colorado garden.

Likewise, analysis of data from a lake near treeline showed that algal biomass declined 10-25-fold both early in the lake history and during the last similar to4000 yr, when inputs of UVR-absorbing dissolved organic matter (DOM) declined despite constant nutrient levels since similar to10,000 C-14 yr before the present. This rapid (-1.25% yr(-1)), sustained (>600 yr) suppression of algal abundance arose from directional climate change that reduced DOM inputs and occurred despite initial reservoirs of photoprotective DOM that are typical of most boreal lakes.

We used Bayesian logistic regression to develop predictive models for resident butterflies in the central Great Basin of western North America. Species inventory data and values for 14 environmental variables from 49 locations (segments of canyons) in the Toquima Range (Nevada, US.A.) were used to build the models. Squares of the environmental variables were also used to accommodate possibly nonmonotonic responses. We obtained statistically significant models for 36 of 56 (64%) resident species of butterflies. The models explained 8-72% of the deviance in occurrence of those species, Each of the independent variables was significant in at least one model, and squared versions of five variables contributed to models. Elevation was included in more than half of the models. Models included one to four variables; only one variable was significant in about half the models.

We measured soil CO2 efflux and soil temperature and moisture in two 20 in x 20 m plots from June 1998 to August 1999. The Q(10) values calculated from soil temperature at 10-cm. depth ranged spatially from 1.21 to 2.63 among 18 chamber locations in the plots. Seasonally, the Q(10) values calculated on the basis of the average Soil CO2 efflux and temperature (10 cm) across the sites could vary from 1.05 to 2.3. Q(10) and soil temperature are negatively correlated through a simple linear relationship with R-2 values of 0.45, 0.40, and 0.54 for soil temperature at 5-, 10-, and 20-cm depth, respectively. However, Q(10) and soil moisture are positively correlated with R-2 values of 0.81, 0.86, and 0.51 for soil temperature at 5-, 10-, and 20-cm depth, respectively. Q(10) values derived from temperatures at different soil depths also showed considerable variation along the vertical dimension. Q(10) had a large seasonal variation with the annual minimum occurring in midsummer and the annual maximum occurring in winter. Seasonal values of Q(10) depended closely on both soil temperature and moisture. Soil temperature and moisture explained 93% of the seasonal variation in Q(10). The spatial variation of Q(10) had significant influences on the estimation of soil CO2 efflux of the ecosystem.

Such designs are especially challenging if the signal to be monitored is uncertain, such as in the case of ecosystem response to climate change. I illustrate an approach in which a simulation model is used to design a monitoring scheme that focuses on application-specific sensitivities or uncertainties. Formal model analysis defines these sensitivities in the model's parameter space. These parametric domains are then mapped into geographic space by regressing model sensitivity on terrain variables in a geographic information system. Specific sites for monitoring are then selected by sampling with a two-stage stratified-cluster design from these parametrically sensitive or uncertain locations, As an example, I use a forest simulation model to design a monitoring scheme as part of a climate-change research program in the southern Sierra Nevada of California (USA). I analyze the model to summarize its sensitivity to variation in temperature and precipitation, and then add a consideration of uncertainty due to the influence of topographic convergence on soil moisture-an influence not simulated by the model.

Although excellent paleoclimatic records exist for the polar regions, paleoclimatic ice core records are not common from midlatitude locations. An ice core removed from the Upper Fremont Glacier in Wyoming provides evidence for abrupt climate change during the mid-1800s. Volcanic events (Krakatau and Tambora) identified from electrical conductivity measurements (ECM) and isotopic and chemical data from the Upper Fremont Glacier were reexamined to confirm and refine previous chronological estimates of the ice core. At a depth of 152 m the refined age-depth profile shows good agreement (1736 +/- 10 A.D.) with the C-14 age date (1729 +/- 95 A.D.). The delta(18)O profile of the Upper Fremont Glacier (UFG) ice core indicates a change in climate known as the Little Ice Age (LIA). However, the sampling interval for delta(18)O is sufficiently large (20 cm) such that it is difficult to pinpoint the LIA termination on the basis of delta(18)O data alone. Other research has shown that changes in the delta(18)O variance are generally coincident with changes in ECM variance. The ECM data set contains over 125,000 data points at a resolution of 1 data point per millimeter of ice core. A 999-point running average of the ECM data set and results from f tests indicates that the variance of the ECM data decreases significantly at about 108 m. At this depth, the age-depth profile predicts an age of 1845 A.D. Results indicate the termination of the LIA was abrupt with a major climatic shift to warmer temperatures around 1845 A.D. and continuing to present day. Prediction limits (error bars) calculated for the profile ages are +/-10 years (90% confidence level). Thus a conservative estimate for the time taken to complete the LIA climatic shift to present-day climate is about 10 years, suggesting the LIA termination in alpine regions of central North America may have occurred on a relatively short (decadal) timescale.",2000,10.1029/1999JD901095,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,WOS:000085512800022,Shana,No,Yes,No,,"Fremont Glacier, WY",NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Adrienne,No,Maybe,No,flows into Green River,

Modeling is conducted as part of a continuing effort (Wittwer et al., 1995; Bodvarsson and Bandurraga, 1996; Bodvarsson et al., 1997) using TOUGH2, a multiphase, integrated finite difference numerical model (Pruess, 1991) calibrated using available saturation, water potential and pneumatic data from six boreholes (Bodvarsson et al., 1997). Modeling results indicate that wetter future climatic conditions may increase lateral diversion above low permeability units of the Calico Hills nonwelded (CHn) hydrogeologic unit, and decrease lateral diversion above the Paintbrush nonwelded (PTn) hydrogeologic unit. The existence of lateral diversion above the CHn hydrogeologic unit is important if this diversion allow moisture to bypass altered zeolitic layers where radionuclides potentially released from the repository could be sorbed. Lateral diversion within the PTn hydrogeologic unit is important because it could redistribute the spatial distribution of net infiltration above the repository horizon. Nevertheless, no field evidence of lateral diversion in the PTn unit has been observed, suggesting that faulting or interface heterogeneities limit lateral flow. Collection and analysis of additional,geochemical data may decrease uncertainty in capability of the PTn and altered CHn hydrogeologic units to create barriers to vertical flow, improving confidence in future climatic predictions.

Sedimentary structures, grain size, grain roundness, loss on ignition, charcoal abundance, bulk authigenic geochemistry, colour, mineralogy and microscopic charcoal identifications show that a fine-grained fan developed through a succession of depositional environments. Within each environment, sediment erosion, transportation and deposition processes were conditioned by changing dominant partial area contributions and complex geomorphic responses. Neither the rate nor the processes of aggradation have been constant through time. Succession from one depositional environment to another involved the crossing of geomorphic thresholds. While climate may have affected sediment yield and therefore the timing of threshold crossings, the basic sequence was controlled by aggradation alone. The sensitivity of this site to climate change is thus overwhelmed by internal processes. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

Both variables are, in turn, correlated with mammal species richness, but this relationship is not necessarily positive.

In the Great Basin of the arid western United States, studies of the relationship between rodent species richness and precipitation have revealed only a positive relationship between these two variables. It has, however, been argued that if areas of higher precipitation were to be sampled within this region, the decline phase would become evident. When latest Pleistocene and Holocene small mammal assemblages from the northern Bonneville Basin (central Utah) are examined across a temporal moisture gradient, species richness declines as moisture declines.

Fan deposition was probably triggered by a change from relatively moist to arid conditions causing a decrease in vegetation cover and increases in flash floods and sediment yield. We think that this scenario applies to most of the other valleys in the southern Basin and Range. Radiocarbon, tephra, and a few thermoluminescence and cosmogenic ages from outcrops throughout Fish Lake Valley and from cores on the Leidy Creek fan yield ages of > 100-50 ka and 11-0 ka for the last two periods of alluvial-fan deposition. Mapping, coring and shallow seismic profiling indicate that these periods were synchronous throughout the valley and on the proximal and distal parts of the fans. From 50 to 11 ka, fan deposition ceased, a soil formed on the older alluvium and the axial drainage became active as runoff and stream competence increased. Slow deposition due to sheet flow or aeolian processes locally continued during this interval, producing cumulic soil profiles. The soil was buried by debris-flow sediment beginning at about 11 ka, coincident with the onset of relatively dry and warm conditions in the region. However, ground-water discharge maintained a large freshwater marsh on the valley floor throughout the Holocene. Pulses of deposition during the Holocene are recorded in the marsh and fan deposits; some pulses coincided with periods of or transitions to warm, dry climate indicated by proxy climate records, whereas others may reflect local disturbances associated with volcanism and fires.

This study addressed two questions: (1) How does prefire heterogeneity of the landscape affect postfire patterns of fire severity? and (2) How do postfire patterns of burn severity influence plant reestablishment? At three sites, 100 sampling points were distributed regularly in a 1-km x 1-km grid and sampled annually from 1989 to 1992. Information was recorded on fire severity (damage to trees, depth of ash and soil charring, and percent mineral soil exposed); pre-fire forest structure (forest successional stage; tree density; toe species; tree size; and evidence of pre-fire disturbance by mountain pine beetle [Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopk.] or mistletoe [Arceuthobium americanum Nutt. ex Engelm.]); postfire percent cover of graminoids, forbs, and low shrubs; number of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia Engelm.) seedlings; and general topographic characteristics (slope and aspect). Fire severity was influenced by successional stage, with older stands more likely to be in the more severe burn class, and by tree diameter, with tree damage diminishing with tree size. Prefire bark beetle and mistletoe damage also influenced fire severity: severe prefire damage increased the likelihood of crown fire, but intermediate prefire damage reduced the likelihood of crown fire. Fire severity was not influenced by slope, aspect, or tree density. Postfire percent vegetative cover and density of lodgepole pine seedlings varied with burn severity. In lightly burned areas, percent cover returned to unburned levels by 1991. In severely burned areas, total percent cover was about half that of unburned areas by 1992, and shrub cover remained reduced. Recruitment of lodgepole pine seedlings was greatest during the second postfire year and in severe-surface burns rather than in crown fires. Continued monitoring of vegetation dynamics in Yellowstone's burned forests will contribute to our understanding of successional processes following a disturbance that was exceptional in its size and severity.",1999,10.1071/WF99003,Forestry,WOS:000087549100003,Shana,Yes,Yes,Yes,,Yellowstone NP,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Adrienne,Yes,No,No,Heart Lake is in CRB; doesn't mention climate change,

The validation of this reconstruction relies on an accurate understanding of the delta O-18(p) and the associated regional climate change in response to the uplift of the western North America. Here we study this response using a global climate model (GCM) with explicit delta O-18(p) diagnostics (ECHAM5-wiso) focusing on the isotopic effects of different types of precipitation, vapor mixing, recycling and moisture source and compare the response against estimates made using a Rayleigh distillation models of moist adiabatic condensation (RDM). Four experiments are performed with Eocene topography inferred from terrestrial stable isotope paleoaltimetry records to investigate how southward propagation of topography affects regional climate (temperature, precipitation and circulation pattern) and delta O-18(p) over North America. Our experiments predict delta O-18 patterns that are broadly consistent with maps of temporally binned proxy delta O-18 and generally support an early Cenozoic north-to-south propagation of high topography in the North American Cordillera. They do not support the commonly made assumption that isotopic fractionation occurs primarily through rainout following Rayleigh distillation nor the application of modern empirical delta O-18(p) lapse rates to past environments. In our GCM simulations, precipitation processes and climate changes that are not captured by RDMs substantially affect delta O-18(p). These processes include shifts in local precipitation type between convective and large-scale rain and between rain and snow; intensification of low-level vapor recycling particularly on leeward slopes; development of air mass mixing and changes in wind direction and moisture source. Each of these processes can have significant (>= 2 parts per thousand) influences on delta O-18(p) that are comparable in magnitude to surface uplift of hundreds or even thousands of meters. In many regions, these processes fortuitously compensate each other, explaining the apparent agreement between ECHAM5-wiso and proxy delta O-18 and, more broadly, between RDM estimates and observed delta O-18-elevation relationships. In some regions, compensation is incomplete, and as a result, ECHAM5-wiso delta O-18(p) does not agree with estimates from the RDM. In these regions, including the interior of the northern cordillera and the eastern flank of the southern Cordillera, moderate adjustments of paleoelevations may be in order.",2013,10.2475/07.2013.01,Geology,WOS:000324222900001,Adrienne,Maybe,No,No,Landscape/State-Province,,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Adrienne,Yes,Maybe,Paleo,,

We capitalize on this opportunity by examining the Holocene glacial record at Mount Baker, an active stratovolcano in northwest Washington. Earlier workers concluded that glaciers on Mount Baker during the early Holocene were more extensive than during the Little Ice Age and hypothesized that the explanation lay in unusual climatic or hypsometric effects peculiar to large volcanoes. We show that the main argument for an early Holocene glacier advance on Mount Baker, namely the absence of ca 10,000-year-old tephra on part of the south flank of the mountain, is incorrect. Moreover, a lake-sediment core indicates that a small cirque moraine previously thought be of early Holocene age is also likely older than the tephra and consequently of late Pleistocene age. Lateral and end moraines and wood mats ca 2 km downvalley of the present snout of Deming Glacier indicate that an advance during the Younger Dryas interval was little more extensive than the climactic Little Ice Age advance. Tephra and wood between tills in the left lateral moraine of Easton Glacier suggest that ice on Mount Baker was restricted in the early Holocene and that Neoglaciation began ca 6 ka. A series of progressively more extensive Neoglacial advances, dated to about 2.2, 1.6, 0.9, and 0.4 ka, are recorded by stacked tills in the right lateral moraine of Deming Glacier. Intervening retreats were long enough to allow establishment of forests on the moraine. Wood mats in moraines of Coleman and Easton glaciers indicate that Little Ice Age expansion began before 0.7 ka and was followed by retreat and a readvance ca 0.5 ka. Tree-ring and lichen data indicate glaciers on the south side of the mountain reached their maximum extents in the mid-1800s. The similarity between glacier fluctuations at Mount Baker and those elsewhere in the Cascades and in British Columbia suggests a coherent history of Holocene climate change over a broad area of the western Cordillera. We found no evidence that glaciers on stratovolcanoes behave differently than glaciers elsewhere. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

On the basis of sampling from 24 locales, we found that Northern Goshawks were genetically structured across a large portion of their North American range. Long-term population stability, combined with strong genetic differentiation, suggests that Northern Goshawks were historically isolated within at least three refugial populations representing two regions: the Pacific (Cascades-Sierra-Vancouver Island) and the Southwest (Colorado Plateau and Jemez Mountains). By contrast, populations experiencing significant growth were located in the Southeast Alaska-British Columbia, Arizona Sky Islands, Rocky Mountains, Great Lakes, and Appalachian bioregions. In the case of Southeast Alaska-British Columbia, Arizona Sky Islands, and Rocky Mountains, Northern Goshawks likely colonized these regions from surrounding refugia. The near fixation for several endemic haplotypes in the Arizona Sky Island Northern Goshawks (A. g. apache) suggests long-term isolation subsequent to colonization.

Statistical approaches to testing phylogeographic hypotheses accommodate this stochasticity by evaluating competing models of putative historical population structure, often by simulating null distributions of the expected variance. The effectiveness of these tests depends on the biological realism of the models. Information from the fossil record can aid in reconstructing the historical distributions of some taxa. However, for the majority of taxa, which lack sufficient fossils, paleodistributional modeling can provide valuable spatial-geographic data concerning ancestral distributions. Paleodistributional models are generated by projecting ecological niche models, which predict the current distribution of each species, onto a model of past climatic conditions. Here, we generate paleodistributional models describing the suitable habitat during the last glacial maximum for lineages from the mesic forests of the Pacific Northwest of North America, and use these models to generate alternative phylogeographic hypotheses. Coalescent simulations are then used to test these hypotheses to improve our understanding of the historical events that promoted the formation of population genetic structure in this ecosystem. Results from Pacific Northwest mesic forest organisms demonstrate the utility of these combined approaches. Paleodistribution models and population genetic structure are congruent across three amphibian lineages, suggesting that they have responded in a concerted manner to environmental change. Two other species, a willow and a water vole, despite being currently codistributed and having similar population genetic structure, were predicted by the paleodistributional model to have had markedly different distributions during the last glacial maximum. This suggests that congruent phylogeographic patterns can arise from incongruent ancestral distributions. Paleodistributional models introduce a much-needed spatial-geographic perspective to statistical phylogeography. In conjunction with coalescent models of population genetic structure, they have the potential to improve our understanding of the factors that promote population divergence and ultimately produce regional patterns of biodiversity.",2007,10.1111/j.1558-5646.2007.00117.x,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,WOS:000247125100015,Meghan,Maybe,No,No,,Pleistocene climate change,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Adrienne,Yes,Maybe,Paleo,,

Global changes in climate are overprinted on longer-term paleogeographic variations, resulting in a complex time-space distribution of climate-sensitive lithologies. The significance of such lithologies in Carboniferous successions of the western United States has not been fully explored. In this study, we provide new interpretations for the paleoclimatic context of the Amsden and Tensleep Formations (Pennsylvanian, Northern Wyoming, USA). The Amsden Formation consists of a basal sandstone member overlain by red siltstones containing pisolites. Very large-scale (similar to 10 m) cross-bedding within the basal sandstone indicates deposition in an erg environment. Iron pisoid-rich layers in the overlying member suggest an evolution toward more humid conditions. Persistent arid conditions during the middle Pennsylvanian are suggested by eolian sandstones and calcretes in the overlying Tensleep Formation. These formations were deposited on the karst topography that developed on top of the lower to middle Mississippian Madison Group. Although the development of karstic features implies that humid conditions prevailed during the late Mississippian, evaporites and evidence for early dolomitization within the formation suggest that it was deposited under arid conditions. These relationships argue for a long-term climate evolution from arid to humid during the Mississippian, and a return to arid conditions during the Pennsylvanian. This trend can be explained by the northward drift from similar to 15 degrees S to similar to 12 degrees N. A comparison with contemporaneous records reveals a diachronous evolution across western Pangaea, with the climatic conditions documented on the Wyoming Shelf being reached later in eastern North America. These relationships indicate that plate motion considerably overprints long-term climatic records. Departures from this trend, suggested by the presence of erg deposits in the basal Amsden Formation, record the overprinting of shorter periods of climate change. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Our objective was to examine if fire occurrence and severity may have been a driver of Holocene forest-composition change. The data from this study suggests that while fire can create opportunities for successional process to occur, fire events were not significant catalysts for forest change.

The network includes 177 locations where depthintegrated snow samples are collected each spring near peak accumulation. At 57 of these locations snowpack samples were obtained for 10-21 years and their isotopic measurements provide unprecedented spatial and temporal documentation of snowpack isotope values at mid-latitudes. For environments where snowfall accounts for the majority of annual precipitation, snowmelt is likely to have the strongest influence on isotope values retained in proxy archives. In this first presentation of the dataset we (1) describe the basic features of the isotope values in relation to the Global Meteoric Water Line (GMWL), (2) evaluate space for time substitutions traditionally used to establish delta O-18-temperature relations, (3) evaluate site-to-site similarities across the network and identify those that are the most regionally representative, (4) examine atmospheric circulation patterns for several years with spatially coherent isotope patterns, and (5) provide examples of the implications this new dataset has for interpreting paleoclimate records (Bison Lake, Colorado and Minnetonka Cave, Idaho). Results indicate that snowpack delta O-18 is rarely a simple proxy of temperature. Instead, it exhibits a high degree of spatial heterogeneity and temporal variance that reflect additional processes such as vapor transport and post-depositional modification. Despite these complexities we identify consistent climate-isotope patterns and regionally representative locations that serve to better define Holocene hydroclimate estimates and their uncertainty. Climate change has and will affect western U.S. snowpack and we suggest these changes can be better understood and anticipated by oxygen and hydrogen isotope-based reconstructions of Holocene hydroclimate using a process-based understanding of the controls on snowpack isotope ratios.

Canada, and adjacent regions, yet its history, especially in the late-glacial, is poorly understood. We present four new pollen and macrofossil records, summarize modern surface spectra and review previous studies to understand the role of A. lasiocarpa during the marked climatic changes of the late-glacial and early-Holocene. Today, in southern British Columbia, A. lasiocarpa reaches between 5 and 20% cover in the vegetation at Crater Lake, Buckbean Bog, and Lake of the Woods, but the 1-5% Abies pollen values under-represent its occurrence in the vegetation. At Sicamous Creek Lake, A. lasiocarpa grows at 50% cover and Pinus is absent locally, but the modern pollen surface spectra under-represent sub-alpine fir at 10% of the pollen rain. Based on these observations, sediments from Sicamous Creek Lake, Crater Lake, Buckbean Bog, and Lake of the Woods reveal that Abies grew locally in the late-glacial period. On southern Vancouver Island, British Columbia, the occurrence of an A. lasiocarpa needle, dated to 11900+/-400 (14)C yr BP in a lake core, along with only 1-2% Abies pollen, suggests that the tree grew at low elevations where it does not today. These results and a review of regional paleobotanical records suggest that the role of A. lasiocarpa in late-glacial and early-Holocene vegetation communities has been under-estimated. This species was likely a major element of the vegetation during this interval and among the first tree species to colonize deglaciated surfaces. Considering the magnitude of future climate change, a better understanding of the history of A. lasiocarpa during previous climate changes is necessary to project vegetation response and design effective resource management plans.

The results have also been related to independently inferred vegetation and climate changes. Following deglaciation, when both lakes were receiving high inputs of clastic materials, benthic diatom taxa dominate the records of these two shallow lakes with small species of Fragilaria being particularly prominent. During the early to mid-Holocene period, when treeline was at a higher elevation than today, the diatom flora of both lakes became more diverse with previously minor species becoming more prominent. Cyclotella radiosa occurs in cores from both Mary Lake, and much deeper, neighbouring Lake O'Hara during the warm early Holocene, and may reflect this warmer climate, a longer ice-free season than presently, and perhaps less turbid water, or its presence may reflect a subtly higher nutrient status of the lake water during this period. The Neoglacial is marked by increased amounts of sediments originating from glacial sources in Opabin Lake, which undoubtedly led to very turbid water, and by the presence of Ellerbeckia arenaria f. teres and Campylodiscus noricus v. hibernica in Opabin Lake; however, these species are absent from Mary Lake which has not been influenced by either glacial activity since the recession of the glaciers prior to c. 10 000 years BP or water originating from Opabin Lake. The impact of the two tephras during the Holocene was dramatic in terms of increased diatom production, as exemplified by the increases in diatom numbers, but there was little effect upon species composition. The diatom records and changes in the diatom: cyst ratio suggest that the chemical status of these two small, shallow lakes has changed little during the Holocene, other than after deposition of the two tephras.

A well-established hydrological model, the University of British Columbia (UBC) watershed model, is selected and applied in five different river basins located in Canada, Cyprus, and Pakistan. Catchments from cold, temperate, continental, and semiarid climate zones are included to demonstrate the procedures developed. Two methodologies for streamflow modelling are proposed and analysed. The first method uses the UBC watershed model with a universal set of parameters for water allocation and flow routing, and precipitation gradients estimated from the available annual precipitation data as well as from regional information on the distribution of orographic precipitation. This method is proposed for watersheds without streamflow gauge data and limited meteorological station data. The second hybrid method proposes the coupling of UBC watershed model with artificial neural networks (ANNs) and is intended for use in poorly gauged watersheds which have limited streamflow measurements. The two proposed methods have been applied to five mountainous watersheds with largely varying climatic, physiographic, and hydrological characteristics. The evaluation of the applied methods is based on the combination of graphical results, statistical evaluation metrics, and normalized goodness-of-fit statistics. The results show that the first method satisfactorily simulates the observed hydrograph assuming that the basins are ungauged. When limited streamflow measurements are available, the coupling of ANNs with the regional, non-calibrated UBC flow model components is considered a successful alternative method to the conventional calibration of a hydrological model based on the evaluation criteria employed for streamflow modelling and flood frequency estimation.",2014,10.5194/nhess-14-1641-2014,Geology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Water Resources,WOS:000340105800001,Adrienne,Yes,Yes,Yes,plot/family/group,Illecillewaet is in CRB headwaters.

However, discerning the relative influence of air temperature and plant available soil water (W) on growth is difficult because they interact with each other, with other climate factors and with the inherent seasonal timing of cambial activity. Douglas-fir growth response to air temperature and W patterns during the growing season was examined using time series regression analysis of dendrometer data collected at approximately four-week intervals from 1998 through 2009. Five study sites were located in mature forest stands along an elevation gradient from the Pacific coast to the west slope of the Cascade Mountains (similar to 1200 m) in Oregon, USA. Maximum daily air temperature (T) and W were similar in relative importance to tree growth at four of the five sites. W was substantially more important at one site. Growth rate increased with T to an optimum (T-opt) and decreased with higher T. At the two drier sites T and W affected growth interactively in that T-opt decreased with decreasing W. We conclude that both T and W affect growth and that T consistently limits growth at three of the five sites and at all sites in years with above average summer temperature. Should climate change result in hotter summers in the region as predicted by climate models, we suggest that Douglas-fir will experience progressive temperature limitation.

Environmental classification is a first step towards quantifying these tradeoffs by creating the framework necessary for analysing the effects of flow variability on riverine biota. Our study presents a spatially explicit hydrogeomorphic classification of streams and rivers in Washington State, USA and investigates how projected climate change is likely to affect flow regimes in the future. We calculated 99 hydrologic metrics from 15?years of continuous daily discharge data for 64 gauges with negligible upstream impact, which were entered into a Bayesian mixture model to classify flow regimes into seven major classes described by their dominant flow source as follows: groundwater (GW), rainfall (RF), rain-with-snow (RS), snow-and-rain (SandR), snow-with-rain (SR), snowmelt (SM) and ultra-snowmelt (US). The largest class sizes were represented by the transitional RS and SandR classes (14 and 12 gauges, respectively), which are ubiquitous in temperate, mountainous landscapes found in Washington. We used a recursive partitioning algorithm and random forests to predict flow class based on a suite of environmental and climate variables. Overall classification success was 75%, and the model was used to predict normative flow classes at the reach scale for the entire state. Application of future climate change scenarios to the model inputs indicated shifts of varying magnitude from snow-dominated to rain-dominated flow classes. Lastly, a geomorphic classification was developed using a digital elevation model (DEM) and climatic data to assign stream segments as either dominantly able or unable to migrate, which was cross-tabulated with the flow types to produce a 14-tier hydrogeomorphic classification. The hydrogeomorphic classification provides a framework upon which empirical flow alterationecological response relationships can subsequently be developed using ecological information collected throughout the region.

World-wide extinctions of amphibians are at the forefront of the biodiversity crisis, with climate change figuring prominently as a potential driver of continued amphibian decline. As in other taxa, changes in both the mean and variability of climate conditions may affect amphibian populations in complex, unpredictable ways. In western North America, climate models predict a reduced duration and extent of mountain snowpack and increased variability in precipitation, which may have consequences for amphibians inhabiting montane ecosystems. 2. We used Bayesian capturerecapture methods to estimate survival and transition probabilities in a high-elevation population of the Columbia spotted frog (Rana luteiventris) over 10 years and related these rates to interannual variation in peak snowpack. Then, we forecasted frog population growth and viability under a range of scenarios with varying levels of change in mean and variance in snowpack. 3. Over a range of future scenarios, changes in mean snowpack had a greater effect on viability than changes in the variance of snowpack, with forecasts largely predicting an increase in population viability. Population models based on snowpack during our study period predicted a declining population. 4. Although mean conditions were more important for viability than variance, for a given mean snowpack depth, increases in variability could change a population from increasing to decreasing. Therefore, the influence of changing climate variability on populations should be accounted for in predictive models. The Bayesian modelling framework allows for the explicit characterization of uncertainty in parameter estimates and ecological forecasts, and thus provides a natural approach for examining relative contributions of mean and variability in climatic variables to population dynamics. 5. Longevity and heterogeneous habitat may contribute to the potential for this amphibian species to be resilient to increased climatic variation, and shorter-lived species inhabiting homogeneous ecosystems may be more susceptible to increased variability in climate conditions.",2012,10.1111/j.1365-2656.2012.01992.x,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Zoology,WOS:000307343100006,Becky,Maybe,Yes,Yes,plot/family/group,Spotted frog in high elevations in Western US,Adrienne,Yes,Yes,Yes,plot/family/group,Little Rock Creek --> Bitterroot River --> Clark Fork,NA,,,,,Adrienne,Yes,Yes,Yes,,

A large proportion of the landscape falls into one of several categories of protected lands. However, protected lands in the region are primarily higher elevation forest and mountain habitats. Little is known about how the network of protected lands may maintain connectivity for a broad spectrum of species expressing different habitat requirements and dispersal abilities. Location The study was conducted across the states of Montana and northern Idaho, USA, comprising an area of 30.2 million hectares. Methods We used resistant kernel modelling to map the extent of the study area predicted to be connected by dispersal for each of 35 species groups with different ecological associations. We evaluated the effect of vagility on protected area sufficiency by varying dispersal ability across three levels for each species group. We evaluated the degree of vulnerability of each of the 105 hypothetical species (35 species groups x 3 dispersal abilities) in terms of the extent of the total study area predicted to be connected by dispersal. We defined nine categories of risk as the combination of species vulnerability because of the extent of connected habitat and the degree to which that habitat was protected. Results We found high variation in the vulnerability of species because of the extent of connected habitat, and the extent to which connected habitat overlapped protected lands. Species associated with high elevations and species associated with lower elevations were predicted to have limited extent of connected habitat. Species associated with high elevations were predicted to have the vast majority of their connected habitat protected by federal Forest Service and National Park Service lands. In contrast, species associated with lower elevations were poorly protected by the existing network of protected lands. Main conclusions Low elevation and non-forest habitats are at highest risk of human-induced habitat loss and fragmentation in the study area.

We evaluated relationships among local climate variables, annual survival and fecundity, and population growth rates from a 9-year demographic study of Columbia spotted frogs (Rana luteiventris) in the Bitterroot Mountains of Montana. We documented an increase in survival and breeding probability as severity of winter decreased. Therefore, a warming climate with less severe winters is likely to promote population viability in this montane frog population.

A global climate model was first applied at 1 degrees x 1.25 degrees grid resolution with a subgrid orographic precipitation scheme. The global simulations were then used to drive a regional climate model at 15-km grid resolution over the Western United States. By comparing the global and regional simulations for two 10-year periods, 1993-2003 and 2039-2049, this study assesses the two downscaling methods in the context of simulating both the present climate and climate change signals. and the implications of the relatively short simulation length to investigate differences in current and future climate simulated by the models are discussed. The model results show that improving the representation of surface topography through higher spatial resolution or a subgrid method has a large impact on the simulations. Both the subgrid scheme and the regional model significantly improved the simulation of snowpack in the mountains. The spatial distributions of precipitation and snowpack are generally consistent between the subgrid and regional simulations, since they were driven by the same large-scale circulation from the global simulations. However, because rain-shadow effects are not represented in the subgrid scheme, the regional simulations produced much more realistic spatial variability in precipitation and snowpack than the subgrid simulations in narrow mountain ranges. In the climate change experiments, both downscaling procedures preserved the large-scale patterns of temperature and precipitation changes in the global simulations. However, the regional simulations show larger changes in precipitation and snowpack along the coastal mountains than the subgrid simulations. This is attributed to the fact that the regional model explicitly simulates the interactions of atmospheric circulation and the underlying topography, so changes in wind directions with respect to the orientations of the mountains may lead to changes in orographic precipitation that cannot he explained by changes in atmospheric temperature and moisture alone. Hence differences between the precipitation changes simulated by the regional model and the subgrid method are larger in narrow mountains such as the Cascades and the Sierra Nevada because the subgrid method does not account for the influence of mountain orientations at the subgrid scale. As precipitation is an important driver of surface hydrological processes, differences between the precipitation changes simulated by the two methods lead to important differences in the surface hydrological processes under climate change.

Using PRISM climate and productivity data measured on a grid of 3356 plots, we developed a simultaneous autoregressive (SAR) model to estimate the impacts of climate change on potential productivity of Pacific Northwest (PNW) forests of the United States. Productivity, measured by projected potential mean annual increment (PMAI) at culmination, is explained by the interaction of annual temperature, precipitation, and precipitation in excess of evapotranspiration through the growing season. By utilizing information regarding spatial error in the SAR model, the resulting spatial bias is reduced thereby improving the accuracy of the resulting maps. The model, coupled with climate change output from four generalized circulation models, was used to predict the productivity impacts of four different scenarios derived from the fourth IPCC special report on emissions, representing different future economic and environmental states of the world, viz., scenario A1B, A2, B1 (low growth, high economic development and low energy usage), and COMMIT. In these scenarios, regional average temperature is expected to increase from 0.5 to 4.5 degrees C, while precipitation shows no clear trend over time. For the west and east side of the Cascade Mountains, respectively, PMAI increases: 7% and 20% under A1B scenario: 8% and 23% under scenario A2; 5% and 15% under scenario B1, and 2% and 5% under the COMMIT scenario. These projections should be viewed as potential changes in productivity, since they do not reflect the mitigating effects of any shifts in management or public policy. For managers and policy makers, the results suggest the relative magnitude of effects and the potential variability of impacts across a range of climate scenarios. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This basic understanding is also providing a foundation for predicting and managing the consequences of climate change on ecosystems, including their resilience to disturbance, biotic diversity, and carbon and nutrient dynamics. To help address the challenges of climate change, future soil ecology research and management would benefit from a complex systems approach, where network and dynamics systems theory are used to predict plant community and ecosystem responses to disturbance. A reductionist approach to management that ignores networks and system dynamics, by contrast, is destined to contribute to ecological degradation as climate changes. In this paper, I describe mycorrhizal networks as models of biological networks in the interior Douglas-fir forests of British Columbia, and the role they play in carbon flux and regeneration dynamics following disturbance.

Annual post-fire sediment yields were computed and grouped into four measurement methods (hillslope point and plot measurements, channel measurements of suspended-sediment and sediment erosion or deposition volumes). Post-fire sediment yields for each method were then grouped into eight different rainfall regimes. Mean sediment yield from channels (240 t ha(-1)) was significantly greater than from hillslopes (82 t ha(-1)). This indicated that on the time scale of wildfire (10-100 years) channels were the primary sources of available sediment. A lack of correlation of sediment yield with topographic slope and soil erodibility further suggested that sediment availability may be more important than slope or soil erodibility in predicting post-fire sediment yields. The maximum post-fire sediment yields were comparable to long-term sediment yields from major rivers of the world.

We used a diagnostic set of class and landscape spatial pattern metrics to compare current spatial patterns of test subwatersheds against the two sets of reference conditions. in a companion decision support model built with the EMDS modeling system, we considered the degree of departure in the subwatersheds, relative to the two sets of reference conditions along with two additional criteria (vulnerability to severe wildfire and timber harvest opportunity), to determine the relative priority of landscape restoration treatments, and the potential for timber harvest to underwrite the treatments. In the decision support model, the current spatial pattern conditions of physiognomic types, cover types, forest structural classes, and those of late-successional and old forest patches of the two subwatersheds were compared against the two sets of reference conditions. The degree of departure in spatial patterns of physiognomic conditions was moderate in both subwatersheds in the pre-management era and climate-change comparisons. The situation was similar for the cover-type departure analysis, but spatial patterns of cover types increased in similarity to the reference conditions in the western subwatershed under the climate-change scenario. Spatial patterns of structural conditions showed a high degree of departure in both subwatersheds when compared to either set of reference conditions, but similarity improved in the eastern subwatershed under the climate-change scenario. Spatial patterns of late-successional + old forest structure were strongly similar to the broad envelope of conditions represented by the pre-management era reference in the western and moderately similar in the eastern subwatershed, but declined in both subwatersheds when compared with the climate-change reference conditions. When the degree of departure in spatial patterns of all patch types was considered along with vulnerability to severe wildfire and timber harvest opportunity, the eastern subwatershed rated higher priority for landscape improvement using either set of reference conditions.

We used a combination of biophysically informed sampling ( to identify sample sites) and dendroclimatology ( to identify growth - climate relationships) along a climate gradient in northwestern United States mountain ecosystems from the western Olympic Peninsula, Washington to the eastern Rocky Mountain Front, Montana. We used a multi- scale sampling strategy that accounted for continentality, physiography, and topography as non- climatic factors that could in. uence climate and alter tree growth. We developed a network of 124 Douglas-. r tree- ring chronologies and explored growth - climate correlations across the sampled gradients. We considered two different spatial scales of monthly and seasonal climate variables as potential controlling factors on tree growth. Annual radial growth in 60 - 65% of the plots across the region is signi. cantly correlated with precipitation, drought, or water balance during the late summer prior to growth and the early summer the year of growth. In a few plots, growth is positively correlated with cool- season temperature or negatively correlated with snowpack. Water availability is therefore more commonly limiting to Douglas-. r growth than energy limitations on growing season length. The. rst principal component derived from the chronologies is signi. cantly correlated with independent drought reconstructions. The sensitivity of Douglas-. r to summer water balance de. cit ( potential evapotranspiration minus actual evapotranspiration) indicates that increases in April to September temperature without increases in summer precipitation or soil moisture reserves are likely to cause decreases in growth over much of the sampled area, especially east of the Cascade crest. In contrast, Douglas-. r may exhibit growth increases at some higher elevation sites where seasonal photosynthesis is currently limited by growing- season length or low growing- season temperature.

Recent methods to improve both the resolution and accuracy of interpolation models have focused on the development of ""up-sampling"" algorithms based on local lapse rate adjustments to the original interpolated surfaces. Lapse rates can be derived from statistical models (e.g., elevation-based polynomial regression equations) or dynamical models (e.g., vertical temperature profiles from numerical weather prediction (NWP) models). This study compares a widely used statistical up-sampling algorithm, ClimateBC, with two NWP reanalysis products, the National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Corporation for Atmospheric Research, Reanalysis 1 (NCEP1) and the more modern European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis Interim (ERA-Interim). Thirty-year climate normals for maximum and minimum temperatures were calculated using statistical up-sampling and NWP lapse rate adjustments to existing PRISM-based climate normals at a subset of stations in BC. Specifically, up-sampling model evaluation was performed using 1951-80 climate normals from an independent set of 54 surface stations (1 m to 2347 m) which were not included in the PRISM interpolation or assimilated into the NWP reanalysis products. All models performed similarly for minimum temperature, which showed only a slight improvement over PRISM. For maximum temperature, ClimateBC, NCEP1 and ERA-Interim all performed significantly better than PRISM, in particular during spring and summer. The ERA-Interim reanalysis outperformed NCEP1 in almost all months. The results suggest that lapse rate adjustment algorithms based on reanalysis products will have greater potential as progress continues on developing NWP components.",2012,10.1080/07055900.2011.649035,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Oceanography,WOS:000301708900002,Danny,Maybe,Yes,Yes,Landscape/State-Province,Western Canada BC Includes CRB in portion of data,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Adrienne,Yes,Yes,Yes,,

We studied the current state and potential causes of fragmentation in grizzly bears over approximately 1,000,000 km(2) of western Canada, the northern United States (US), and southeast Alaska. We compiled much of our data from projects undertaken with a variety of research objectives including population estimation and trend, landscape fragmentation, habitat selection, vital rates, and response to human development. Our primary analytical techniques stemmed from genetic analysis of 3,134 bears, supplemented with radiotelemetry data from 792 bears. We used 15 locus microsatellite data coupled with measures of genetic distance, isolation-by-distance (IBD) analysis, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), linear multiple regression, multi-factorial correspondence analysis (to identify population divisions or fractures with no a priori assumption of group membership), and population-assignment methods to detect individual migrants between immediately adjacent areas. These data corroborated observations of inter-area movements from our telemetry database. In northern areas, we found a spatial genetic pattern of IBD, although there was evidence of natural fragmentation from the rugged heavily glaciated coast mountains of British Columbia (BC) and the Yukon. These results contrasted with the spatial pattern of fragmentation in more southern parts of their distribution. Near the Canada-US border area, we found extensive fragmentation that corresponded to settled mountain valleys and major highways. Genetic distances across developed valleys were elevated relative to those across undeveloped valleys in central and northern BC. In disturbed areas, most inter-area movements detected were made by male bears, with few female migrants identified. Northsouth movements within mountain ranges (Mts) and across BC Highway 3 were more common than eastwest movements across settled mountain valleys separating Mts. Our results suggest that relatively distinct subpopulations exist in this region, including the Cabinet, Selkirk South, and the decades-isolated Yellowstone populations. Current movement rates do not appear sufficient to consider the subpopulations we identify along the Canada-US border as 1 inter-breeding unit. Although we detected enough male movement to mediate gene flow, the current low rate of female movement detected among areas is insufficient to provide a demographic rescue effect between areas in the immediate future (0-15 yr). In Alberta, we found fragmentation corresponded to major eastwest highways (Highways 3, 11, 16, and 43) and most inter-area movements were made by males. Gene flow and movement rates between Alberta and BC were highest across the Continental Divide south of Highway 1 and north of Highway 16. In the central region between Highways 1 and 11, we found evidence of natural fragmentation associated with the extensive glaciers and icefields along the Continental Divide. The discontinuities that we identified would form appropriate boundaries for management units. We related sex-specific movement rates between adjacent areas to several metrics of human use (highway traffic, settlement, and human-caused mortality) to understand the causes of fragmentation. This analysis used data from 1,508 bears sampled over a 161,500-km(2) area in southeastern BC, western Alberta, northern Idaho, and northern Montana during 1979-2007. This area was bisected by numerous humantransportation and settlement corridors of varying intensity and complexity. We used multiple linear regression and ANCOVA to document the responses of female and male bears to disturbance. Males and females both demonstrated reduced movement rates with increasing settlement and traffic. However, females reduced their movement rates dramatically when settlement increased to >20% of the fracture zone. At this same threshold, male movement declined more gradually, in response to increased traffic and further settlement. In highly settled areas (>50%), both sexes had a similar reduction in movements in response to traffic, settlement, and mortality. We documented several small bear populations with male-only immigration, highlighting the importance of investigating sex-specific movements. Without female connectivity, small populations are not viable over the long term. The persistence of this regional female fragmented metapopulation likely will require strategic connectivity management. We therefore recommend enhancing female connectivity among fractured areas by securing linkage-zone habitat appropriate for female dispersal, and ensuring current large source subpopulations remain intact. The fragmentation we documented may also affect other species with similar ecological characteristics: sparse densities, slow reproduction, short male-biased dispersal, and a susceptibility to human-caused mortality and habitat degradation. Therefore, regional inter-jurisdictional efforts to manage broad landscapes for inter-area movement will likely benefit a broad spectrum of species and natural processes, particularly in light of climate change.

At each location we derived monthly indices representative of anticyclonicity using NCEP/NCAR 700 hPa reanalysis pressure fields. The number of anticyclonic days minus cyclonic days (A-C) is positively correlated with temperature anomalies at exposed convex sites and in the north of the domain where the free atmosphere controls temperature, anticyclonic months being warmer. In topographic concavities, and in the south of the domain where the influence of upper air ridges and troughs is muted, the relationship is much weaker. We use the gradient of the A-C index-temperature relationship to represent a coupling index, highest at exposed free-air locations. On a mean annual basis there are no strong relationships between temperature trend magnitude, elevation, topographic incision, or coupling index. However, in winter, warming is weaker at decoupled locations, especially when snow cover is present. Where snow is absent in winter, and in fall, the relationship is reversed. Circulation changes (increased cyclonicity) can explain the disparity in warming between decoupled and exposed locations in fall and to a certain extent in winter (increased anticyclonicity), although winter results are also regionally sensitive. Thus, future climate change may be different (amplified or muted dependent on season and/or surface characteristics) in locations prone to surface decoupling, compared with locations exposed to the free atmosphere. Understanding such processes will aid downscaling of future climate change.",2011,10.1029/2010JD014769,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,WOS:000291102000001,Danny,Yes,Yes,Yes,Landscape/State-Province,CRB Sites play significant role,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Adrienne,Yes,Yes,Yes,,

Most populations are currently declining, and some face extirpation. In southern Canada, caribou range has retreated considerably over the past century. The ultimate reason for their decline is habitat alterations by industrial activities. The proximate causes are predation and, to a lesser extent, overharvest. The most southerly populations of ""Mountain"" caribou are at imminent risk of extirpation. Mountain caribou are threatened by similar industrial activities as Boreal caribou, and face increasing harassment from motorized winter recreational activities. Most populations of ""Migratory Tundra"" caribou are currently declining. Although these caribou fluctuate in abundance over decades, changing harvest technologies, climate change, increasing industrial development and human presence in the North raise doubts over whether recent declines will be followed by recoveries. The Peary caribou (Rangifer tarandus pearyi J.A. Allen, 1902), a distinct subspecies endemic to Canada's High Arctic, has suffered drastic declines caused by severe weather, hunting and predation. It faces an increasing threat from climate change. While some questions remain about the reasons for the decline of Migratory Tundra caribou, research has clearly identified several threats to the persistence of ""Boreal"", Mountain, and Peary caribou.

This study examines the spatial and temporal variability in nocturnal air temperatures across a mountainous region of Northern Idaho. Principal components analysis (PCA) was applied to a network of 70 Hobo temperature loggers systematically distributed across 2 mountain ranges. Four interpretable modes of variability were observed in average nighttime temperatures among Hobo sites: (1) regional/synoptic; (2) topoclimatic; (3) land surface feedback; (4) canopy cover and vegetation. PC time series captured temporal variability in nighttime temperatures and showed strong relationships with regional air temperatures, sky conditions and atmospheric pressure. PC2 captured the topographic variation among temperatures. A cold air drainage index was created by predicting PC2 loadings to elevation, slope position and dissection indices. Nightly temperature maps were produced by applying PC time series back to the PC2 loading surface, revealing complex temporal and spatial variation in nighttime temperatures. Further development of both physically and empirically based daily temperature models that account for synoptic atmospheric controls on fine-scale temperature variability in mountain ecosystems are needed to guide future monitoring efforts aimed at assessing the impact of climate change.

Understanding past changes and anticipating future changes under different potential management scenarios are fundamental to developing ecologically based fuel reduction or ecological restoration treatments. Some of the many changes that have occurred in these forests include shifts from historically frequent surface fire to no fire or to stand-replacing fire regimes, increases in tree density, increased abundance of fire-intolerant trees, decreases in understory productivity, hydrological alterations, and accelerated mortality of old trees. Although these changes are widespread, the magnitude and causes of changes may vary within and among landscapes. Agents of change, such as fire exclusion or livestock grazing, likely interacted and had multiple effects. For example, historical ranching operations may have altered both fire regimes and understory vegetation, and facilitated institutional fire exclusion through fragmentation and settlement. Evidence exists for large variation in presettlement characteristics and current condition of old growth across this broad forest region, although there are many examples of striking similarities on widely distant landscapes. Exotic species, climate change, unnatural stand-replacing wildfires, and other factors will likely continue to degrade or eradicate old growth in many areas. As a policy of fire exclusion is proving to be unsustainable, mechanical tree thinning, prescribed fire, or wildland fire use will likely be key options for forestalling continued eradication of old growth by severe crown fires.

We combined a model of the impact of climatic conditions on the establishment and persistence of mountain pine beetle populations with a spatially explicit, climate-driven simulation tool. Historic weather records were used to produce maps of the distribution of past climatically suitable habitats for mountain pine beetles in British Columbia. Overlays of annual mountain pine beetle occurrence on these maps were used to determine if the beetle has expanded its range in recent years due to changing climate. An examination of the distribution of climatically suitable habitats in 10-year increments derived from climate normals (1921-1950 to 1971-2000) clearly shows an increase in the range of benign habitats. Furthermore, an increase (at an increasing rate) in the number of infestations since 1970 in formerly climatically unsuitable habitats indicates that mountain pine beetle populations have expanded into these new areas.

Therefore, the response of mountain snow hydrology to changes in air temperature and precipitation was examined by simulating a perturbed climate in Reynolds Mountain East (RME), a headwater catchment with a cool mountain climate in Idaho, USA. The cold regions hydrological model was used to calculate snow accumulation, wind redistribution by blowing snow, interception by forest canopies, sublimation and melt for 25 seasons in RME. The uncalibrated simulations of the highly redistributed snow water equivalent compared well to measurements. Results showed that with concomitant occurrence of warming (5 degrees C) and precipitation change (+/- 20%) in RME, the peak seasonal snow accumulation decreased by 84-90%, snowmelt decreased 51-79%, rainfall to total precipitation ratio increased from 30% to 78%, and overwinter blowing snow transport and sublimation losses from intercepted snow, the snow surface and blowing snow decreased dramatically. Warming causes an increase in inter-water year snowcover variability but a decrease in spatial snow accumulation variability. When warming exceeded 1 degrees C and a precipitation increased by less than 20%, the peak snow accumulation declined dramatically. The results contrast with those from further north along the North American Cordillera in Yukon, Canada, where the impacts of similar warming on alpine snow can be partly compensated for by concomitant increases in precipitation of less than 20%.

Hoary marmots (Marmota caligata) range throughout much of the mountainous Pacific Northwest (PNW) and Rocky Mountains while the closely related Olympic and Vancouver Island marmots (M. olympus and M. vancouverensis, respectively) are restricted to small isolated regions of the PNW. The endemic Vancouver Island marmot is currently classified as Critically Endangered and the Olympic marmot has recently experienced dramatic population declines. Previous phylogenetic studies of PNW marmot species have had limited power as they focused on resolving interspecific relationships, implicitly assumed an absence of gene flow among currently recognized species, included relatively few individuals, and relied heavily or entirely on mitochondrial DNA. We sequenced 2 mitochondrial and 4 nuclear markers from 167 hoary, 4 Vancouver Island, and 5 Olympic marmots in order to investigate phylogenetic relationships and historic gene flow among these species. We recovered 2 monophyletic (and predominantly allopatric) mitochondrial clades of hoary marmots that are not sister groups. Instead, Vancouver Island marmots formed a monophyletic mitochondrial sister clade to 1 of the hoary marmot clades. Nuclear loci did not recover the 2 mitochondrial clades of hoary marmots and suggest that Vancouver Island marmots may have experienced mitochondrial introgression from coastal mainland hoary marmots. Additionally, our nuclear results suggest possible gene flow between hoary and Olympic marmots despite different chromosomal formulas. Rather than resolving what has previously been considered a straightforward 3-taxon phylogenetic question, our findings suggest a complicated history of rapid divergence of the 3 species followed by intermittent and possibly ongoing gene flow between hoary marmots and both Olympic and Vancouver Island marmots. These results therefore have significant implications for the conservation of the latter 2 species, both of which are conservation concerns.",NA,,,,Micah,Maybe,Yes,Yes,Landscape/State-Province,PNW,NA,,,,,,Shana,No,Yes,No,Olympic Mtns.

We relate demographic niche differences to species traits including shade and drought tolerance. We model recruitment under projected climate change using generalized linear mixed models, probabilistic uncertainty accounting, forest structural data and projected changes in the climatic water balance. ResultsOn average juveniles of western US tree species occupy a climatic subset of their conspecific adults.

Main conclusionsClimate change-driven declines in recruitment in western US tree species may be partly offset by the moderating effect of forest canopies. The importance of this stabilizing process will depend on whether a given site is disturbed and the traits of resident species, including their ability to utilize sites that have buffered microclimates.

This interdisciplinary framework couples end users' data needs with observed, biophysical changes at local to regional scales. An online statewide survey of natural resource professionals was conducted to assess the perceived impacts from climate change and determine the biophysical data needed to measure those impacts. Changes to water resources and wildfire risk were the highest areas of concern among resource professionals. Guided by the survey results, 15 biophysical indicator datasets were summarized that included direct climate metrics (e.g., air temperature) and indicators only partially influenced by climate (e.g., wildfire). Quantitative changes in indicators were determined using time series analysis from 1975 to 2010. Indicators displayed trends of varying likelihood over the analysis period, including increasing growing-season length, increasing annual temperature, increasing forest area burned, changing mountain bluebird and lilac phenology, increasing precipitation intensity, earlier center of timing of streamflow, and decreased 1 April snowpack; changes in volumetric streamflow, salmon migration dates, and stream temperature displayed the least likelihood.

Understanding these controls can be especially useful to construct robust predictions of how a species range may change in response to climate change or the extent to which a non-native species may spread in novel environments. Here, we link spatially intensive observations with mechanistic models to illustrate how physiology determines the upstream extent of the aquatic ectotherm smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) in two headwater rivers. Our results demonstrate that as temperatures become increasingly cold across a downstream to upstream gradient, food consumption in age 0 bass becomes increasingly constrained, and as a result, these fish become growth limited. Sufficient first summer growth of age 0 bass is essential for overwinter survival because young bass must persist from energy reserves accumulated during the summer, and those reserves are determined by body size. Our field data reveal the upstream extent of adult bass reproduction corresponds to a point in the downstream/upstream gradient where cold temperatures impair growth opportunities in young bass. This pattern was repeated in both study streams and explained why bass positioned nests twice as far upstream in the warm compared to the cold stream in the same basin. Placement of spawning nests by adult bass is likely subject to strong evolutionary selection in temperate systems: if bass spawn too far upstream, their young are unlikely to grow large enough to survive the winter. Consumption and growth in older bass (age 3-4) was far less sensitive to temperature. Based on these data, we suggest that temperature-sensitive age 0 bass constrain the upstream distribution limits of bass within temperate streams. In this study, we investigated how temperature-dependent physiology changed through the life history of a species and, in doing so, identified a climate-sensitive life-history stage that likely sets the distributional limits of all other life-history stages. We anticipate the framework developed here could be employed to identify how similar stage-specific environmental sensitivity determines distribution in many other ectothermic species.",NA,,,,Micah,Maybe,No,No,,PNW,Paris,Yes,Yes,Yes,Ecosystem/Municipal,John Day River Forks,NA,,,,,Adrienne,Yes,Yes,Yes,,

Although ecological selection pressures have been theorized to play a key role in the stabilization of homoploid hybrid lineages, surprisingly few detailed quantitative studies compare the realized ecological niches of hybrids and their progenitors. In this study, we compare twenty bioclimatic variables (Worldclim) at representative occurrence sites of Abies grandis, Abies concolor, and two classes of their natural hybrids, which are variably intergradient between their progenitors, to assess the potential role of ecological selection in the evolution of the observed morphological patterns of introgression. We find that both hybrid classes occupy distinct habitats that are variably intermediate between those associated with A. grandis and A. concolor for a majority of environmental variables, but with lower precipitation in the summertime in the southern Cascade, Siskiyou, and Sierra Nevada Mountains than associated with either progenitor. We hypothesize that moisture stress and high levels of solar insolation in the summertime associated with hybrid populations have played an important role in the observed patterns of introgression of key traits: leaf angle, specific leaf area, and abundance of adaxial stomates. Phenotypic plasticity in two of these traits may allow hybrids to adapt to an environment with a higher degree of variability in moisture stress. Moreover, in the context of moisture stress associated with predicted climate change, hybrids may have an adaptive advantage over A. grandis.",2015,10.1007/s11258-015-0452-1,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,WOS:000349975000011,Micah,No,No,No,,OR,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Adrienne,Yes,Yes,Yes,"OR, WA, ID, CA",

With spatial resolution often in the tens of kilometers, however, even RCM output will likely fail to resolve local topography that may be climatically significant in high-relief basins. Here we develop and apply an approach for downscaling RCM output using local topographic lapse rates (empirically-estimated spatially and seasonally variable changes in climate variables with elevation). We calculate monthly local topographic lapse rates from the 800-m Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) dataset, which is based on regressions of observed climate against topographic variables. We then use these lapse rates to elevationally correct two sources of regional climate-model output: (1) the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR), a retrospective dataset produced from a regional forecasting model constrained by observations, and (2) a range of baseline climate scenarios from the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP), which is produced by a series of RCMs driven by GCMs. By running a calibrated and validated hydrologic model, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), using observed station data and elevationally-adjusted NARR and NARCCAP output, we are able to estimate the sensitivity of hydrologic modeling to the source of the input climate data. Topographic correction of regional climate-model data is a promising method for modeling the hydrology of mountainous basins for which no weather station datasets are available or for simulating hydrology under past or future climates.

The strong correlation between snowmelt rate and baseflow efficiency (r(2)=0.73) links these relationships and supports a possible streamflow generation mechanism wherein greater snowmelt rates increase subsurface flow.

In addition, we asked key individuals involved in drafting those policies to answer a short questionnaire. We found that research needs mainly concern impact and vulnerability assessments at regional and local levels, integrated assessments, and improved climate and socioeconomic data. These needs are often related to the challenges to data coverage and model performance in mountainous areas. In these areas, the base data are often riddled with gaps and uncertainties, making it particularly difficult to formulate adaptation strategies. In countries where data coverage is less of an issue, there is a tendency to explore quantitative forms of impact and vulnerability assessments.

American pikas (Ochotona princeps) have emerged as a focal mammalian species for investigating extinction risk related to climate change; however, most studies have occurred in characteristic alpine talus habitat within the range core. In the Columbia River Gorge (CRG), Oregon, American pikas inhabit low-elevation talus slopes previously considered outside the species' bioclimatic range. We used microsatellite genotypic data to reconstruct levels of genetic variation, population connectivity, and demographic history at 11 CRG sites spanning an elevational gradient (104-1,292 m). Sampled sites separated into 2 genetic clusters largely explained by elevation, topography, and geographic proximity, with pairwise estimates of differentiation and migration rates suggesting little gene flow may be occurring. Sites were characterized by levels of allelic richness and heterozygosity substantially lower than values reported at characteristic alpine sites from the range core. Evidence of recent demographic contraction was found almost exclusively at high-elevation sites despite these areas being considered refuges from climate warming in more typical habitat. Given their unique genetic characteristics and persistence in an atypical environment, the CRG pika populations likely constitute a significant component of intraspecific biodiversity with high conservation value.",NA,,,,Paris,Yes,Yes,Yes,Landscape/State-Province,"Col.

Wildfire and mountain pine beetles have caused extensive mortality across millions of hectares in this region during the past decade, and wildfire area burned is projected to increase 200%-300% by mid-21st century. Science-management partnerships associated with recent assessments have identified an extensive list of adaptation options, including both strategies (general planning) and tactics (on-the-ground projects). Most of the options focus on increasing resilience to disturbances and on reducing current stressors to resource conditions. Adaptation options are generally similar across the biogeographically diverse region covered by assessments, suggesting that there may be a limit on the number of feasible responses to climate change.

Whitebark pine (WBP) (Pinus albicaulis) in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE) crystalizes the challenges that natural resource managers of many high mountain ecosystems will likely face in the coming decades. We review the system of interactions among climate, competitors, fire, bark beetles, white pine blister rust (Cronartium ribicola), and seed dispersers that make WBP especially vulnerable to climate change. A well-formulated interagency management strategy has been developed for WBP, but it has only been implemented across <1% of the species GYE range. The challenges of complex climate effects and land allocation constraints on WBP management raises questions regarding the efficacy of restoration efforts for WBP in GYE. We evaluate six ecological mechanisms by which WBP may remain viable under climate change: climate microrefugia, climate tolerances, release from competition, favorable fire regimes, seed production prior to beetle-induced mortality, and blister-rust resistant trees. These mechanisms suggest that WBP viability may be higher than previously expected under climate change. Additional research is warranted on these mechanisms, which may provide a basis for increased management effectiveness.

Trends during the 20th century in annually averaged temperature (0.7degreesC-0.9degreesC) and precipitation (13%-38%) exceed the global averages. Largest warming rates occurred in the maritime zone and in winter and at lower elevations in all zones, and smallest warming rates occurred in autumn and in the Rockies. Largest increases in precipitation (upwards of 60% per century) were observed in the dry areas in northeast Washington and south central British Columbia. Increases in precipitation were largest in spring, but were also large in summer in the central and Rocky Mountain climatic zones. These trends have already had profound impacts on streamflow and on certain plant species in the region (Cayan et al. 2001), and other important impacts remain to be discovered.

In addition, young stands were compared to mature lodgepole pine stands (similar to110-year-old) in order to estimate ecosystem recovery 13 years after a stand replacing fire.

In addition to the snow-albedo feedback, seasonal variations of the low-level flow and soil moisture appear to play important roles in the spatial pattern of warming signals. Projected changes in precipitation characteristics are mainly associated with increased moisture fluxes from the Pacific Ocean and the increase in elevation of freezing levels during the cold season.

The lower elevation site had mean annual air and soil (10-cm mineral soil depth) temperatures about 2.4 and 3.9 degrees C higher than the high-elevation site, respectively.

The reciprocal treatment (transferring soil cores from the low- to the high-elevation site) resulted in decreases of about 70, 80, and 65% in annual rates of net N mineralization, nitrification, and inorganic N leaching, respectively. Laboratory incubations of soils under conditions of similar temperature and soil water potential suggest that the quality of soil organic matter is higher at the high-elevation site. Similar in situ rates of soil net N transformations between the two sites occurred because the lower temperature counteracts the effects of greater substrate quantity and quality at the high elevation site.

In the United States, such models are relevant to federally mandated management of wild animals by state-level agencies. We sampled birds during the breeding seasons of 2001-2009 with fixed-radius point counts. For each species, we used boosted regression trees to model incidence (proportion of years a location was surveyed in which the species was present) as a function of topography and current land cover and climate. To assess model fit, we calculated the proportion of binomial deviance explained. We used cross-validation to estimate the predictive accuracy of the models. We applied the conservation planning program Zonation to identify locations where incidences of multiple species were maximized through time given current land cover and two scenarios of land-cover change, expansion of pinyon-juniper woodland into sagebrush shrubsteppe and contraction of riparian woodland. Models based on a set of 13 covariates derived from remotely sensed data had some predictive capacity for 41 of 50 species. Model outputs suggested substantial changes in amount of habitat for many species following projected expansion of pinyon-juniper woodland, but less pronounced changes following projected contraction of riparian woodland. Zonation analyses indicated that the spatial distribution of the highest-quality habitat for the avian assemblage was relatively consistent through time under both scenarios.

In steep bedrock terrain, erosional processes control slope morphology by modulating rates of: (i) weathering in response to climate and pre-disposition, (ii) rock slope retreat in response to magnitude and frequency of detachment, and (iii) channel incision or valley infilling in response to variable sediment supply.

In particular, the spatial variability in hydrologic processes may introduce a high degree of uncertainty in the modelling of a large watershed. This study assessed the uncertainties in annual/seasonal streamflow and annual peak flow simulations with respect to selection of climate data and model parameter sets for the variable infiltration capacity (VIC) model of the Athabasca River basin (ARB) in Alberta, Canada. Two high-resolution gridded climate data sets over the 1979 to 2010 period, and six different model parameter sets calibrated corresponding to different time periods and various hydrologic patterns, were employed to quantify the uncertainty in VIC simulations. Moreover, the possibility of an ensemble approach to predict hydrologic responses in the ARB has been investigated. The results indicated that streamflow simulations near the headwater and along the Athabasca River mainstream have high uncertainty corresponding to selection of climate data mainly because of greater difference of precipitation between the two climate data sets, whereas sub-basin stations at low elevations were more sensitive to the selection of parameter set for interflow-dominated runoff cycle. All stations showed higher uncertainty corresponding to the selection of parameter set for annual peak flows. In addition, this study confirmed that the ensemble means can provide more accurate and consistent hydrologic information for the low-elevation area where higher internal variability exists.

For temperature, GCM uncertainty prevails and SDM uncertainty is nonnegligible. Significant warming and in turn significant changes are predicted for evaporation, snow cover and seasonality of discharges. For precipitation, GCM and SDM uncertainty components are of the same order. A high contribution of the large and small-scale components of internal variability is also obtained, inherited, respectively, from the GCMs and the different replicates of a given SDM. The same applies for annual discharge. The uncertainty in values that could be experienced for any given future period is therefore very high. For both discharge and precipitation, even the sign of future realizations is uncertain at a 90% confidence level. These findings have important implications. Similarly to GCM uncertainty, SDM uncertainty cannot be neglected. The same applies for both components of internal variability.

Nonetheless, the impact of human activity can be detected even in some of the most remote lakes on the planet due to the effects of long-range transport of air pollutants and global climate change. In the UK, upland waters are threatened by a range of pressures including not only atmospheric deposition of acidic compounds, trace metals and organic pollutants, but also climate change, nutrient enrichment by deposited nitrogen and changing land-use or land management regimes. The threat from acid deposition has declined sharply since the 1980s but its legacy remains a major concern; recovery is taking place but even assuming a complete chemical and biological recovery to a pre-industrial baseline were possible, dynamic models suggest that this could take another 100 years. However, current climate change projections suggest that by then, UK upland waters will become much warmer, with lower summer streamflows, higher winter streamflows and a much reduced or even absent influence of snowfall and lake ice-cover. Hence there is no rationale for aspiring to the return of pre-industrial ""reference"" conditions because climate change is likely to shift the climatic baseline at an unprecedented rate. Meanwhile, expansion of forest planting, changing grazing regimes and management measures for peatland restoration, among other land-use pressure, will affect upland catchments in the UK with potentially major repercussions for aquatic ecosystems, both positive and negative. The challenge for scientists, policymakers and other stakeholders in the uplands is to determine not only the trajectory of change in upland waters, but also to define the ecological endpoints needed to provide the optimum range of ecosystem services for society. Integrated monitoring of the kind exemplified by the papers in this volume is a fundamental prerequisite in this regard. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We tested several of their cornerstone hypotheses by measuring the nucleic acid (NA) and phosphorus (P) content of crustacean zooplankton species in 22 high mountain lakes (Sierra Nevada and the Pyrenees mountains, Spain). The P-allocation hypothesis (PAH) proposes that the genome size is smaller in cladocerans than in copepods as a result of selection for fast growth towards P-allocation from DNA to RNA under P limitation. Consistent with the PAH, the RNA: DNA ratio was > 8-fold higher in cladocerans than in copepods, although 'fast-growth' cladocerans did not always exhibit higher RNA and lower DNA contents in comparison to 'slow-growth' copepods. We also showed strong associations among growth rate, RNA, and total P content supporting the growth rate hypothesis, which predicts that fast-growing organisms have high P content because of the preferential allocation to P-rich ribosomal RNA. In addition, we found that ontogenetic variability in NA content of the copepod Mixodiaptomus laciniatus (intra-and interstage variability) was comparable to the interspecific variability across other zooplankton species. Further, according to the metabolic theory of ecology, temperature should enhance growth rate and hence RNA demands. RNA content in zooplankton was correlated with temperature, but the relationships were nutrient-dependent, with a positive correlation in nutrient-rich ecosystems and a negative one in those with scarce nutrients. Overall our results illustrate the mechanistic connections among organismal NA content, growth rate, nutrients and temperature, contributing to the conceptual unification of metabolic and stoichiometric theories.",2014,10.1371/journal.pone.0086493,Science & Technology - Other Topics,WOS:000330244500247,Adrienne,No,Maybe,No,,,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Becky,No,Yes,No,Sierra Nevada and Pyrenees,

Ideally, researchers would conduct genome-scale screening of museum specimens to explore the evolutionary consequences of environmental changes, but to date such analyses have been severely limited by the numerous challenges of working with the highly degraded DNA typical of historic samples. Here, we circumvent these challenges by using custom, multiplexed, exon capture to enrich and sequence similar to 11000 exons (similar to 4Mb) from early 20th-century museum skins. We used this approach to test for changes in genomic diversity accompanying a climate-related range retraction in the alpine chipmunks (Tamias alpinus) in the high Sierra Nevada area of California, USA. We developed robust bioinformatic pipelines that rigorously detect and filter out base misincorporations in DNA derived from skins, most of which likely resulted from postmortem damage. Furthermore, to accommodate genotyping uncertainties associated with low-medium coverage data, we applied a recently developed probabilistic method to call single-nucleotide polymorphisms and estimate allele frequencies and the joint site frequency spectrum. Our results show increased genetic subdivision following range retraction, but no change in overall genetic diversity at either nonsynonymous or synonymous sites. This case study showcases the advantages of integrating emerging genomic and statistical tools in museum collection-based population genomic applications.

Analysis of historical Artemisia pollen-data series from 1992 to 2011 showed that flowering took place between late July and late September, but the trend towards higher summer temperatures detected over the series as a whole appeared to have delayed the start of flowering and brought forward the end of flowering, thus prompting a shortening of the season. A trend was also observed towards a delayed peak pollen period, together with a significant decline in the Annual Pollen Index, which was significantly influenced by rainfall over the months immediately prior to flowering. Recovery Programmes implemented for three species-Artemisia granatensis, A. alba subsp. nevadensis and A. umbelliformis-involved conservation measures including direct seeding and planting of seedlings.

However, there is a lack of high-resolution spatial and temporal data on geomorphological activity within alpine catchments, which are especially sensitive to climate change, human impacts and which are amongst the most dynamic landscapes on Earth. This study used data from repeated laser scanning to identify and quantify the distribution of contemporary sediment sources and the intensity of geomorphological activity within the lower part of a glaciated alpine catchment; Odenwinkelkees, central Austria. Spatially, geomorphological activity was discriminated by substrate class. Activity decreased in both areal extent and intensity with distance from the glacier, becoming progressively more restricted to the fluvially-dominated valley floor. Temporally, geomorphological activity was identified on annual, seasonal, weekly and daily timescales. Activity became more extensive with increasing study duration but more intense over shorter timescales, thereby demonstrating the importance of temporary storage of sediment within the catchment. The mean volume of material moved within the proglacial zone was 4400 m(3).yr(-1), which suggests a net surface lowering of 34 mm.yr(-1) in this part of the catchment. We extrapolate a minimum of 4.8 mm.yr(-1) net surface lowering across the whole catchment. These surface lowering values are approximately twice those calculated elsewhere from contemporary measurements of suspended sediment flux, and of rates calculated from the geological record, perhaps because we measure total geomorphological activity within the catchment rather than overall efflux of material. Repeated geomorphological surveying therefore appears to mitigate the problems of hydrological studies underestimating sediment fluxes on decadal-annual time-scales. Further development of the approach outlined in this study will enable the quantification of geomorphological activity, alpine terrain stability and persistence of landforms. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Evaluations of ecological responses to cumulative effects of management interventions and natural disturbances provide critical decision-support tools for managers who strive to balance environmental conservation and economic development. We conducted an experiment to evaluate the effects of salvage logging on avian community composition in lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) forests affected by beetle outbreaks in Oregon, USA, 1996-1998. Treatments consisted of the removal of lodgepole pine snags only, and live trees were not harvested. We used a Bayesian hierarchical model to quantify occupancy dynamics for 27 breeding species, while accounting for variation in the detection process. We examined how magnitude and precision of treatment effects varied when incorporating prior information from a separate intervention study that occurred in a similar ecological system. Regardless of which prior we evaluated, we found no evidence that the harvest treatment had a negative impact on species richness, with an estimated average of 0.2-2.2 more species in harvested stands than unharvested stands. Estimated average similarity between control and treatment stands ranged from 0.82-0.87 (1 indicating complete similarity between a pair of stands) and suggested that treatment stands did not contain novel assemblies of species responding to the harvesting prescription. Estimated treatment effects were positive for twenty-four (90%) of the species, although the credible intervals contained 0 in all cases. These results suggest that, unlike most post-fire salvage logging prescriptions, selective harvesting after beetle outbreaks may meet multiple management objectives, including the maintenance of avian community richness comparable to what is found in unharvested stands. Our results provide managers with prescription alternatives to respond to severe beetle outbreaks that continue to occur across extensive portions of the dry forests of western North America.",2013,10.1371/journal.pone.0059900,Science & Technology - Other Topics,WOS:000316549400096,Becky,No,Yes,No,Landscape/State-Province,"Oregon, salvage logging impacts on avian species",NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Becky,No,Yes,No,"Fremont and Winema forests in OR (landscape), not high altitude",

Given the substantial acreage of prematurely dying forests within Colorado and Wyoming (similar to two million acres in 2008), MPB infestations have the potential to significantly alter forest canopy, impacting several aspects of the local water and land-energy cycle. Hydrologic processes that may be influenced include canopy interception of precipitation and radiation, snow accumulation, melt and sublimation, soil infiltration and evapotranspiration. To investigate the changing hydrologic and energy regimes associated with MPB infestations, we used an integrated hydrologic model coupled with a land surface model to incorporate physical processes related to energy at the land surface. This platform was used to model hillslope-scale hydrology and land-energy changes throughout the phases of MPB infestation through modification of the physical parameterisation that accounts for alteration of stomatal resistance and leaf area indices. Our results demonstrate that MPB infested watersheds will experience a decrease in evapotranspiration, an increase in snow accumulation accompanied by earlier and faster snowmelt and associated increases in runoff volume and timing. Impacts are similar to those projected under climate change, yet with a systematically higher snowpack. These results have implications for water resource management because of higher tendencies for flooding in the spring and drought in the summer.

To evaluate the long-term impacts of both this insect outbreak and another characteristic disturbance in these forests, high-severity wildfire, we simulated potential changes in species composition and carbon stocks using the Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS). Simulations were completed for 3 scenarios (no disturbance, actual MPB infestation, and modeled wildfire) using field data collected in 2010 at 97 plots in the lodgepole-pine-dominated forests of eastern Grand County, Colorado, which were heavily impacted by MPB after 2002. Results of the simulations showed that (1) lodgepole pine remained dominant over time in all scenarios, with basal area recovering to pre-disturbance levels 70-80 yr after disturbance; (2) wildfire caused a greater magnitude of change than did MPB in both patterns of succession and distribution of carbon among biomass pools; (3) levels of standing-live carbon returned to pre-disturbance conditions after 40 vs. 50 yr following MPB vs. wildfire disturbance, respectively, but took 120 vs. 150 yr to converge with conditions in the undisturbed scenario.

The river has long been over-allocated. Climate models project runoff losses of 5-20 % from the basin by mid-21st century due to human-induced climate change. Recent work has shown that decreased snow albedo from anthropogenic dust loading to the CO mountains shortens the duration of snow cover by several weeks relative to conditions prior to western expansion of the US in the mid-1800s, and advances peak runoff at Lees Ferry, Arizona, by an average of 3 weeks. Increases in evapotranspiration from earlier exposure of soils and germination of plants have been estimated to decrease annual runoff by more than 1.0 billion cubic meters, or similar to 5% of the annual average. This prior work was based on observed dust loadings during 2005-2008; however, 2009 and 2010 saw unprecedented levels of dust loading on snowpacks in the Upper Colorado River Basin (UCRB), being on the order of 5 times the 2005-2008 loading. Building on our prior work, we developed a new snow albedo decay parameterization based on observations in 2009/10 to mimic the radiative forcing of extreme dust deposition. We convolve low, moderate, and extreme dust/snow albedos with both historic climate forcing and two future climate scenarios via a delta method perturbation of historic records. Compared to moderate dust, extreme dust absorbs 2 x to 4 x the solar radiation, and shifts peak snowmelt an additional 3 weeks earlier to a total of 6 weeks earlier than pre-disturbance. The extreme dust scenario reduces annual flow volume an additional 1% (6 % compared to pre-disturbance), a smaller difference than from low to moderate dust scenarios due to melt season shifting into a season of lower evaporative demand. The sensitivity of flow timing to dust radiative forcing of snow albedo is maintained under future climate scenarios, but the sensitivity of flow volume reductions decreases with increased climate forcing.

Among these, cosmogenic radionuclide surface-exposure dating has been widely applied to moraines of mountain glaciers, providing the framework for understanding terrestrial climate change during and since the last glaciation in western North America. During the Late Pleistocene, the Great Basin of the western United States hosted numerous mountain glaciers, the deposits of which can provide valuable records of past climate changes if their ages can be precisely determined. In this study, twenty-nine cosmogenic radionuclide Be-10 surface-exposure ages from a suite of moraines in Seitz Canyon, western Ruby Mountains, limit the timing of the last glacial episode in the interior Great Basin, known as the Angel Lake Glaciation. Results indicate that deposition of a terminal moraine and two recessional moraines began just prior to similar to 20.5 ka and continued until similar to 20.0 ka. Retreat from the next younger recessional moraine began at similar to 17.2 ka, and final deglaciation began at similar to 14.8 ka. These ages are broadly consistent with cosmogenic surface-exposure ages from the eastern Sierra Nevada and the western Wasatch Mountains, in the western and eastern extremes of the Great Basin respectively. Furthermore, these ages suggest that the valley glacier in Seitz Canyon was at or near its maximum extent before and during the hydrologic maxima of Pleistocene lakes in the Great Basin, supporting previous suggestions that a cool and wet climate persisted in this region during the early part of the last glacial-interglacial transition.

The minimum estimated surface area of the 650 ka lake almost equals that of Lake Bonneville during the Provo stage in late MIS 2.

Precipitation (P) increased with elevation to similar to 500 m, and more gradually at higher elevations, while vegetation graded from savanna at 405 m to evergreen oak and pine forest to mid-montane forest to subalpine forest at 2700 m. CO2 uptake and transpiration at 405 m peaked in spring (March to May) and declined in summer; gas exchange at 1160 and 2015 m continued year-round; gas exchange at 2700 m peaked in summer and ceased in winter. A phenological threshold occurred between 2015 and 2700 m, associated with the development of winter dormancy. Annual ET and Gross Primary Production were greatest at 1160 and 2015 m and reduced at 405 m coincident with less P, and at 2700 m coincident with colder temperatures. The large decline in ET above 2015 m raises the possibility that an upslope redistribution of vegetation with climate change could cause a large increase in upper elevation ET. We extrapolated ET to the entire basin using remote sensing. The 2003-11 P for the entire Upper Kings River basin was 984 mm y(-1) and the ET was 429 mm y(-1), yielding a P-ET of 554 mm y(-1), which agrees well with the observed Kings River flow of 563 mm y(-1).

Here, we aim to quantify Miocene paleoelevation of the Central European Alps through stable isotope paleoaltimetry. The novelty of our approach, which renders our analysis less sensitive to past climate change, is that stable isotope proxies of identical age are analyzed from both the high internal parts of the Alpine orogen and the adjacent foreland basin. Whereas the foreland basin was at or near sea level and traces the combined effects of upstream changes in rainfall amount and composition, the high Alpine site additionally records the effect of elevation on stable isotopes in precipitation. We compare hydrogen isotopic ratios (delta D) in mica and chlorite that interacted with meteoric water along the Simplon detachment, a major normal fault that developed at high elevations, with meteoric water compositions deduced from carbonate-bearing paleosols of the North-Alpine foreland basin. delta D values of muscovite (- 126 parts per thousand) and chlorite (- 135V.) from the brittle hanging wall and of recrystallized muscovite (-108 parts per thousand) and biotite (-140 parts per thousand) from adjacent footwall mylonites provide unequivocal evidence for localized syntectonic meteoric water interaction along the Simplon detachment. Detailed Ar-40/Ar-39 and fission track geochronology constrains the timing of isotopic exchange to ca. 14.5 Ma, when the footwall mylonites passed through the ductile to brittle transition. Age-equivalent oxygen isotope ratios (delta O-18) measured within pedogenic carbonate from North-Alpine foreland paleosols that developed near Miocene sea level serve as our low-elevation point of reference. delta O-18 values in these paleosols, dated with ca. 100 ka precision, vary between +19 and +25 parts per thousand (SMOW) with average values of +20 parts per thousand at ca. 14.5 Ma. Using the relative differences between meteoric water compositions in the foreland basin and the high Alpine Simplon detachment, our isotope data are consistent with a mid-Miocene minimum average elevation difference of 2350 (+700/-500) m for the Simplon region. Our results indicate that Miocene Alpine elevations were at least comparable to those of today and are likely to have acted as an important barrier to Atlantic-derived moisture transport into central Europe and Eurasia since that time.

Glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) pose risks to exposed and vulnerable populations and can be linked in part to long-term post-Little Ice Age climate change because precariously dammed glacial lakes sometimes formed as glaciers generally retreated after the mid-1800s. This paper provides an interdisciplinary and historical analysis of 40 years of glacier hazard management on Mount Hualcan, at glacial Lake 513, and in the city of Carhuaz in Peru's Cordillera Blanca mountain range. The case study examines attempted hazard zoning, glacial lake evolution and monitoring, and emergency engineering projects to drain Lake 513. It also analyzes the 11 April 2010 Hualcan rock-ice avalanche that triggered a Lake 513 GLOF; we offer both a scientific assessment of the possible role of temperature on slope stability and a GIS spatial analysis of human impacts. Qualitative historical analysis of glacier hazard management since 1970 allows us to identify and explain why certain actions and policies to reduce risk were implemented or omitted. We extrapolate these case-specific variables to generate a broader socio-environmental framework identifying factors that can facilitate or impede disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation. Facilitating factors are technical capacity, disaster events with visible hazards, institutional support, committed individuals, and international involvement. Impediments include divergent risk perceptions, imposed government policies, institutional instability, knowledge disparities, and invisible hazards. This framework emerges from an empirical analysis of a coupled social-ecological system and offers a holistic approach for integrating disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation.",2012,10.1007/s10584-011-0249-8,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,WOS:000304105600011,Becky,No,Yes,No,,"Peru (may provide mixed-methods approaches, looked at qual data too)",NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Becky,No,Yes,International,Peru,

Of 12 environmental variables we measured at 100-m stream reaches and the adjacent riparian zone, D. tenebrosus relative abundance was positively associated with stream elevation, forest age, and the percentage of boulders within streams. A higher stream gradient was the best predictor of D. tenebrosus presence within a stream reach, with present sites having a 91% higher gradient than absent sites. When excluding sites with low relative abundance, D. tenebrosus presence was also predicted by greater forest age surrounding streams and higher site elevation.

However, much of the state including Yellowstone National Park and the headwaters of several major river systems, may have already been affected by rising temperatures. This paper examines the historic climate record from Wyoming in the context of similar to 14,000-year temperature reconstructions based on fossil pollen data. The analysis shows that 24 of 30 U.S. Historical Climatology Network records from the state show an increase in the frequency of unusually warm years since 1978. Statewide temperatures have included 15 years (50%) from 1978 to 2007 that were greater than 1 sigma above the mean annual temperature for 1895-1978. The frequent warm years coincide with a reduction in the frequency of extremely low (<-20A degrees C) January temperatures, and are not well explained by factors such as solar irradiance and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. Linear regressions require inclusion of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations to explain the multi-decadal temperature trends. The observed warming is large in Yellowstone National Park where 21 years (70%) from 1978 to 2007 were greater than 1 sigma above the 1895-1978 mean; the deviation from the mean (> 1A degrees C) is greater than any time in the past 6,000 years.

Boulders on the La Victoria and Los Zerpa moraines of the Sierra Nevada that mark the extent of the local last glacial maximum (LLGM) yield Be-10 TCN surface exposure ages of 16.7 +/- 1.4 ka (8 samples). About 25 km to the west in the drainage basin of the Rio Mucujun, Be-10 TCN dates for boulders on moraines at La Culata in the Sierra Nevada Norte yield a younger average age of 15.2 +/- 0.9 ka (8 samples). The data suggest that glaciation across the Venezuelan Andes during the LLGM was asynchronous. The LLGM in Venezuela may be broadly concurrent with Heinrich Event 1 at similar to 16.8 ka, implying that glaciation here is dominantly temperature driven. A moraine inset into the older laterofrontal moraines of La Culata has an age of 14.1 +/- 1.0 ka (5 samples); it may have been deposited by a small Late Glacial readvance. Right-lateral offsets of the La Victoria and Los Zerpa moraines by the Bocono fault are each similar to 100 m. The Be-10 TCN based Bocono fault slip rate is about <similar to 5.5 to 6.5 a(-1) mm anotably less than the total right-lateral slip of 12 +/- 2 mm a(-1) of shear documented across the Andes from geodesy. The Be-10 TCN dating of boulders on a faulted alluvial fan along the northwestern range front at Tucanizon yields a late Pleistocene uplift rate of the Andes at between similar to 1.7 +/- 0.7 mm a(-1). Glacial outwash has produced valley-fill sequences within the central Andean valley along the trace of the Bocono fault and Rio Chama. The valley-fill has been incised to produce the 'meseta', a terrace surface that sits > 100 m above the Rio Chama and on which the major city of Merida is built. Geomorphic observations indicate that the meseta deposits were largely derived from the glaciers of La Culata. The OSL dating suggests that the final aggradation of the valley-fill deposits occurred rapidly over a period of about 5 to 6 ka and that the surface was abandoned and initially incised at similar to 30 ka. The result implies Venezuelan valley fills record phases of aggradation that are likely modulated by climate change on glacial/Milankovitch timescales. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

However, thermochronologic age-elevation relationships are known to be perturbed by topographic effects and potential changes in relief, which are neglected in the inherently 1-D interpretation commonly applied. Such data thus potentially record both the denudation and relief history of the sampled region but extracting this information is challenging. In a companion paper, we develop a methodology for rigorously interpreting thermochronologic age-elevation profiles in terms of exhumation rates and relief development through time, and to independently quantify the resolution of these constraints. Here we test this approach using a thermochronological dataset consisting of apatite and zircon fission-track and (U-Th)/He data, collected at La Meije Peak in the Pelvoux-Ecrins massif (French Western Alps). Our data and models suggest a three-phase exhumation history in the Pelvoux-Ecrins massif, including a pulse of rapid exhumation at similar to 6-5.5 Ma, preceded and followed by more moderate rates of denudation in the order of 0.3-0.4 km Myr(-1). This rapid exhumation event appears to occur coevally in other external crystalline massifs in the Alps but is not detected by qualitative inspection the age-elevation relationships. Both our synthetic results and inversion of the La Meije data strongly suggest that apatite fission-track age-elevation relationships alone cannot resolve both denudation and relief histories independently and that multiple thermochronometers are required. Combining apatite fission-track and (U-Th)/He ages and, particularly, including fission-track-length data greatly improves the resolution of the inferred exhumation histories. Although denudation rates through time and the timing rate changes are generally well resolved, our data have insufficient resolution to satisfactorily constrain the relief history. Synthetic results reported in the companion paper suggest that the reason for this limitation is that relief increase through valley carving has been insufficient with respect to the regional denudation rates to be unambiguously extracted from the data.

Location Yosemite National Park, California, USA. Methods We calculated the water balance within Yosemite National Park using a modified Thornthwaite-type method and correlated AET and Deficit with tree species distribution. We used input data sets with different spatial resolutions parameterized for variation in latitude, precipitation, temperature, soil water-holding capacity, slope and aspect. We used climate proxies and climate projections to model AET and Deficit for past and future climate. We compared the modelled future water balance in Yosemite with current species water-balance ranges in North America. Results We calculated species climatic envelopes over broad ranges of environmental gradients - a range of 310 mm for soil water-holding capacity, 48.3 degrees C for mean monthly temperature (January minima to July maxima), and 918 mm yr-1 for annual precipitation. Tree species means were differentiated by AET and Deficit, and at higher levels of Deficit, species means were increasingly differentiated. Modelled Deficit for all species increased by a mean of 5% between past (c. 1700) and present (1971-2000). Projected increases in Deficit between present and future (2020-49) were 23% across all plots. Main conclusions Modelled changes in Deficit between past, present and future climate scenarios suggest that recent past changes in forest structure and composition may accelerate in the future, with species responding individualistically to further declines in water availability. Declining water availability may disproportionately affect Pinus monticola and Tsuga mertensiana. Fine-scale heterogeneity in soil water-holding capacity, aspect and slope implies that plant water balance may vary considerably within the grid cells of kilometre-scale climate models.

A new methodology was applied to characterized time series of temperature, precipitation, and streamflow (i.e., historic and reconstructed undepleted flows) according to the three climate regimes that occurred in CRB during the 20th Century. Results for two tributaries in the Upper CRB show that hydroclimatic variability is more deterministic than previously thought because it entails complementary temperature and precipitation patterns associated with wetter or drier conditions on climate regime and annual scales. Complementary temperature and precipitation patterns characterize climate regime type (e.g., cool/wet and warm/dry), and the patterns entail increasing or decreasing temperatures and changes in magnitude and timing of precipitation according to the climate regime type. Accompanying each climate regime on annual scales are complementary temperature (T) and precipitation (P) patterns that are associated with upcoming precipitation and annual basin yield (i.e., total annual flow volume at a streamflow gauge). Annual complementary T and P patterns establish by fall, are detectable as early as September, persist to early spring, are related to the relative magnitude of upcoming precipitation and annual basin yield, are unique to climate regime type, and are specific to each river basin. Thus, while most of the water supply in the Upper CRB originates from winter snowpack, statistically significant indictors of relative magnitude of upcoming precipitation and runoff are evident in the fall, well before appreciable snow accumulation. Results of this study suggest strategies that may integrated into existing forecast methods to potentially improve forecast accuracy and advance lead time by as much as six months (i.e., from April 1 to October 1 of the previous year). These techniques also have applications in downscaling climate models and in river restoration and management. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

As currently understood, the fauna consists of 33 species of mammals, including the following new taxa: Mimoperadectes sowasheensis, new species, Apatemys pygmaeus, new species; Palaeosinopa aestuarium, new species; Naranius americanus, new species; Colpocherus mississippiensis, new genus and species; Diacocherus dockeryi, new species; Wyonycteris primitivus, new species; Choctawius foxi, new genus and species; Haplomylus meridionalis, new species; Ectocion nanabeensis, new species; Miacis igniculus, new species; Eogale parydros, new genus and species; Viverriscus omnivorus, new genus and species; Paramys dispar, new species; Corbarimys? nomadus, new species; and Franimys? actites, new species. New combinations proposed here include Plagioctenodon dormaalensis (Quinet, 1964), Plagioctenodon rosei (Gingerich, 1987), Choctawius mckennai (Szalay, 1969), and Paramys wutui (Tong and Dawson, 1995). The Red Hot local fauna derives from an estuarine sand unit that also yields fossil spores, pollen, dinoflagellate cysts, fishes, and snakes. The fauna is taphonomically biased against the preservation of mammals having medium to large body mass. The Red Hot local fauna provides a rare opportunity to gauge the significance of biotic provincialism within North America near the Paleocene-Eocene boundary, a time of dynamic climate change. Faunal endemism with respect to the Rocky Mountain Interior of North America is high at the species level, consistent with evidence for substantive differences in the physical environment and flora. Several lines of evidence, including mammalian biostratigraphy, sequence stratigraphy, and dinoflagellate zonation, suggest that the Red Hot local fauna correlates with earliest Wasatchian (Wa-M) faunas from the Bighorn Basin of Wyoming. Latitudinal shifts in taxon ranges coincident with global warming provide an alternative explanation for seemingly transient episodes of phyletic dwarfing among mammals during the PETM in the Bighorn Basin.",2009,10.2992/007.078.0301,Paleontology; Zoology,WOS:000272637300001,Courtney,No,,No,,Mississippi,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Becky,No,Yes,No,bighorn basin,

We focused on structural variation in the needles, shoots, and branchlets within different crown positions (leader crown vs lower crown) of the dwarf trees. In the leader crown, which appears above the snow surface earlier than the lower crown, current-year shoots and branchlets had greater total biomass, and foliage was more closely packed along the stem axis than in the lower crown, whereas current-year shoots in the leader crown had a lower needle mass ratio than in the lower crown. These results suggest that current-year shoots and branchlets in the leader crown have a specific structure that allows them to harvest more light, although construction and maintenance costs would be higher. In contrast, the structural characteristics of current-year shoots and branchlets in the lower crown efficiently concentrate incoming light by avoiding mutual shading within foliage, thus leading to increased biomass of photosynthetic needles within shoot and branchlet biomass. Such within-crown variability at various hierarchical levels from needles to branches in mature, but very dwarf, A. mariesii trees maintains the crown and allows survival within conifer clumps in areas of subalpine parklands that receive heavy snowfall.",2009,10.1007/s10310-009-0115-y,Forestry,WOS:000266160200004,Courtney,No,,No,,Japan,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Becky,No,Yes,No,,

Large trees generally have lower rates of mortality than small trees and are more resilient to climate change, but these assumptions have rarely been examined in long-term studies. We combined data from 655 historical (1932-1936) and 210 modern (1988-1999) vegetation plots to examine changes in density of large-diameter trees in Yosemite National Park (3027 km(2)). We tested the assumption of stability for large-diameter trees, as both individual species and communities of large-diameter trees. Between the 1930s and 1990s, large-diameter tree density in Yosemite declined 24%. Although the decrease was apparent in all forest types, declines were greatest in subalpine and upper montane forests (57.0% of park area), and least in lower montane forests (15.3% of park area). Large-diameter tree densities of 11 species declined while only 3 species increased. Four general patterns emerged: (1) Pinus albicaulis, Quercus chrysolepis, and Quercus kelloggii had increases in density of large-diameter trees occur throughout their ranges; (2) Pinus jeffreyi, Pinus lambertiana, and Pinus ponderosa, had disproportionately larger decreases in large-diameter tree densities in lower-elevation portions of their ranges; (3) Abies concolor and Pinus contorta, had approximately uniform decreases in large-diameter trees throughout their elevational ranges; and (4) Abies magnifica, Calocedrus decurrens, Juniperus occidentalis, Pinus monticola, Pseudotsuga menziesii, and Tsuga mertensiana displayed little or no change in large-diameter tree densities. In Pinus ponderosa-Calocedrus decurrens forests, modern large-diameter tree densities were equivalent whether or not plots had burned since 1936. However, in unburned plots, the large-diameter trees were predominantly A. concolor, C decurrens, and Q chrysolepis, whereas P. ponderosa dominated the large-diameter component of burned plots. Densities of large-diameter P. ponderosa were 8.1 trees ha(-1) in plots that had experienced fire, but only 0.5 trees ha(-1) in plots that remained unburned. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

New low-temperature thermochronometry reveals that intense orogenic deformation is not restricted to one side of the syntaxis but extends nearly 300 km south along the dextral Fairweather fault. Apatite and zircon (U-Th)/He ages as young as 0.9 and 2.0 Ma suggest maximum exhumation rates of nearly 2 mm/a in close proximity (<10 km) to the Fairweather fault and average exhumation rates of >0.5 mm/a along the entire plate margin. We estimate that long-term rock uplift accommodates similar to 3 mm/a of fault-normal convergence in this area. This suggests that the Fairweather fault is slightly transpressive and highly partitioned, analogous to the central San Andreas fault. This convergence only accounts for similar to 1/5 of the obliquity between Pacific plate motion and the continental margin, however, implying the deficit is taken up by 1-2 cm/a thrust-sinistral motion along the offshore Transition fault. Additionally, thermochronometry shows a marked increase in bedrock cooling coincident with onset of heavy glaciation, similar to what has been observed in other parts of the Pacific Northwest. The tectonically active Fairweather corridor is distinguished, however, by the magnitude of the acceleration and the depth of exhumation since Pliocene climate change. Citation: McAleer, R.J., J.A.

The atmospheric dynamics theory of density stratified fluid flow over topography is used to interpret the results. The controlling nondimensional parameter is Nh/U, where N is the Brunt-Vaisala frequency, a measure of atmospheric stability, h is the terrain relief, and U is the initial horizontal wind speed. Rain shadow development is found to be a nonlinear and nonunique function of both topography and atmospheric state, indicating that geological records of orographic aridity cannot be interpreted in terms of relief alone. When upstream topography exceeds Nh/U approximate to 1 during surface uplift, downstream orographic precipitation vanishes, and downstream orographic cloud mass decreases by as much as 90%. Upstream blocking of air flow can generate a forward projecting rain shadow in which a relatively low ridge (Nh/U < 1) situated upstream of a relatively high ridge (Nh/U > 1) may be decoupled from the atmospheric flow by a zone of flow stagnation extending upstream of the high terrain. Such an effect may occur if the valley separating the two ranges is narrower than the length scale of flow stagnation. In the model configuration used here, lateral widening of a relatively low (Nh/U < 1) range changes downstream orographic cloud mass by only a few percent, while lateral growth of a relatively high (Nh/U > 1) range increases downstream cloud mass by up to a factor of 3. These results help to refine interpretations of climate-tectonic interactions in shaping the geological record of the Sierra Nevada and Andes.",2009,10.1029/2008JF001085,Geology,WOS:000263612900001,Courtney,No,,No,,Sierra Nevada and Andes,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Becky,No,Yes,No,Sierra Nevada and Andes.,

Water temperature is a key characteristic of stream ecosystems that is gaining scientific and managerial relevance as maximum temperatures in aquatic ecosystems increase worldwide. 2. To assess the effect of surface-subsurface water exchange on stream water temperature patterns, four alluvial reaches in the Tagliamento River basin (NE Italy), constrained by geomorphic knickpoints at the upper and lower end, and two to four hyporheic flowpaths within each reach, were continuously studied during summer 2007 and winter 2007-08. Water temperature was continuously monitored at the upstream and downstream knickpoints of the floodplains, as well as at discrete upwelling areas within each reach. Discharge and vertical hydraulic gradient were measured along the alluvial reaches, and the residence time and chemistry of upwelling water were assessed four times during the study. 3. Discharge variation along the study reaches revealed that massive hyporheic exchange occurred in all sites, ranging from 21% in reach 2-52% in reach 1. End member mixing analysis showed little influence of ground water, as almost all upwelling water was freshly infiltrated hyporheic water. Importantly, hyporheic exchange flows shaped surface temperature at the upwelling locations in all study reaches, providing potential thermal refugia for aquatic biota. At sites with highest hyporheic flow rates, net temperature change was also reflected at the floodplain scale. 4. The magnitude of the thermal change along a hyporheic flowpath was not related to the flowpath length but to the estimated (222)Rn water age. Reduction in the diel thermal amplitude by hyporheic flows rather than net temperature change, reduced temperature extremes. Therefore, restoration activities to create thermal refugia should consider the role of hyporheic flows and enhance the exchange between surface and hyporheic waters.",2009,10.1111/j.1365-2427.2008.02109.x,Marine & Freshwater Biology,WOS:000262470300007,Courtney,No,,No,,Italy,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Becky,No,Yes,International,italy,

Loss and fragmentation of grasslands and meadows may impact biodiversity, carbon storage, energy balance, and climate change. In the Pacific Northwest region of North America, grasslands and meadows have declined in extent over the past century. Largely undocumented in this regional decline are the grass balds of the Oregon Coast Range, isolated grasslands in a landscape dominated by coniferous forests. This study was conducted to quantify the spatial extent and patterns of grass bald change. Five balds in the Oregon Coast Range were evaluated using historical aerial photographs and recent digital orthophoto quadrangles (DOQ). Over the time period of study (1948/1953 to 1994/2000), bald area declined by 66%, primarily from forest encroachment. The number and average size of bald vegetation patches declined, while edge density increased. Tree encroachment into balds was inversely related to distance from nearest potential parent trees. Spatial patterns of bald loss may result from a forest to bald gradient of unfavorable environmental conditions for tree establishment and/or seed dispersal limitation. Species dependent on balds may be at risk from loss of bald area and increased fragmentation, although metrics of habitat fragmentation may not reflect species-specific habitat requirements. Tree encroachment patterns and increased bald edge densities suggest increasing rates of bald loss in the future. The remote sensing nature of this study cannot determine the fundamental causes of bald decline, although prior research suggests climate change, cessation of native burning, successional changes in response to prior wildfires, and cessation of livestock grazing all may have potential influence.",2009,10.1007/978-90-481-2798-6_13,Plant Sciences,WOS:000271458700013,Courtney,No,Yes,No,,oregon coast range,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Becky,No,Yes,No,Oregon Coast Range,

Net changes in temperatures responsible for this remarkable deglacierization are less than 2 degrees C, a small fraction of the warming that occurred at the end of the Pleistocene. Yet the effects of warming of the past century have been profound. Alpine permafrost, which expanded during the Little Ice Age, is now thinning. Large areas at high elevations may become completely free of permafrost by the end of the 21st century. Loss of alpine permafrost and glacier downwasting appear to be partly responsible for accelerated mass wasting and catastrophic slope failures in high mountains in recent decades. New lakes appeared during the Little Ice Age when glaciers advanced across streams and rivers and blocked drainage. Most of these lakes drained one or more times during the past century, producing catastrophic floods orders of magnitude larger than normal nival or rainfall floods. In some instances, lakes have appeared upvalley of former, drained ones as glaciers have continued to retreat under a warming climate. Lakes also formed behind Little Ice Age end moraines when glaciers retreated in the early 20th century. Moraine dams are vulnerable to failure because they are steep-sided and consist of loose sediment. Outburst floods from lakes dammed by glaciers and moraines erode, transport, and deposit huge amounts of sediment over distances of tens of kilometers. They broaden floodplains, destroy pre-flood channels, and create a new braided planform. Outburst floods from glacier- and moraine-dammed lakes have claimed thousands of lives in the Andes and Himalayas and continue to be a hazard in these and other mountain ranges.",2009,10.1007/978-3-540-69970-5_29,Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology,WOS:000262710300030,Courtney,Yes,Yes,No,Biome/National,"Glacial Outbursts, Canada",NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Becky,No,Yes,No,,

Glacial environments are characterized by high mass turnover and combined with changing climatic conditions, potential problems and process interactions can evolve rapidly. Remote sensing based terrain mapping, geographic information systems and flow path modelling are integrated here to explore the extent of ice avalanche, debris flow and lake flood hazard potential in the Mount Cook region. Numerous proglacial lakes have formed during recent decades, but well vegetated, low gradient outlet areas suggest catastrophic dam failure and flooding is unlikely. However, potential impacts from incoming mass movements of ice, debris or rock could lead to dam overtopping, particularly where lakes are forming directly beneath steep slopes. Physically based numerical modeling with RAMMS was introduced for local scale analyses of rock avalanche events, and was shown to be a useful tool for establishing accurate flow path dynamics and estimating potential event magnitudes. Potential debris flows originating from steep moraine and talus slopes can reach road and built infrastructure when worst-case runout distances are considered, while potential effects from ice avalanches are limited to walking tracks and alpine huts located in close proximity to initiation zones of steep ice. Further local scale studies of these processes are required, leading towards a full hazard assessment, and changing glacial conditions over coming decades will necessitate ongoing monitoring and reassessment of initiation zones and potential impacts.",2009,,Geology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Water Resources,WOS:000265743400018,Courtney,No,Yes,No,,New Zealand,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Becky,No,Yes,International,Mount Cook region of New Zealand's Southern Alps,

Binary mixing calculations suggest that more than 5011,, of the lead in the Sacramento River outside of the region of influence of the West Shasta Cu-mining district is derived from past depositions of leaded gasoline emissions. This predominance is the first direct documentation of the geographic extent of gasoline lead persistence throughout a large riparian system (> 160,000 kill 2) and corroborates previous observations based on samples taken at the mouth of the Sacramento River. In addition, new analyses of sediment samples from the hydraulic gold mines of the Sierra Nevada foothills confirm the present-day fluxes into the Sacramento River of contaminant metals derived from historical hydraulic Au-mining that occurred during the latter half of the 19th and early part of the 20th centuries.

The regional model MM5 was nested within time-slice global atmospheric model experiments conducted by the HadAM3H model. We evaluate the capability of the model in simulating the observed climate with emphasis on low-level circulation patterns and surface variables, such as precipitation and surface air mean, maximum and minimum temperatures. The regional model performance was evaluated in terms of seasonal means, seasonal cycles, interannual variability and extreme events. Overall, the regional model is able to capture the main features of the observed mean surface climate over South America, its seasonal evolution and the regional detail due to topographic forcing. The observed regional patterns of surface air temperatures (mean, maxima and minima) are well reproduced. Biases are mostly within 3C, temperature being overestimated over central Argentina and underestimated in mountainous regions during all seasons. Biases in northeastern Argentina and southeastern Brazil are positive during austral spring season and negative in other seasons. In general, maximum temperatures are better represented than minimum temperatures. Warm bias is larger during austral summer for maximum temperature and during austral winter for minimum temperature, mainly over central Argentina. The broad spatial pattern of precipitation and its seasonal evolution are well captured; however, the regional model overestimates the precipitation over the Andes region in all seasons and in southern Brazil during summer. Precipitation amounts are underestimated over the La Plata basin from fall to spring. Extremes of precipitation are better reproduced by the regional model compared with the driving model. Interannual variability is well reproduced too, but strongly regulated by boundary conditions, particularly during summer months.

When environmental change occurs over short temporal and large spatial scales, vagile species are expected to move geographically by tracking their climatic niches through time. Here, we test for evidence of niche tracking in bird species of the Sierra Nevada mountains of California, focusing on 53 species resurveyed nearly a century apart at 82 sites on four elevational transects. Changes in climate and bird distributions resulted in focal species shifting their average climatological range over time. By comparing the directions of these shifts relative to the centroids of species' range-wide climatic niches, we found that 48 species (90.6%) tracked their climatic niche. Analysis of niche sensitivity on an independent set of occurrence data significantly predicted the temperature and precipitation gradients tracked by species. Furthermore, in 50 species (94.3%), site-specific occupancy models showed that the position of each site relative to the climatic niche centroid explained colonization and extinction probabilities better than a null model with constant probabilities. Combined, our results indicate that the factors limiting a bird species' range in the Sierra Nevada in the early 20th century also tended to drive changes in distribution over time, suggesting that climatic models derived from niche theory might be used successfully to forecast where and how to conserve species in the face of climate change.",2009,10.1073/pnas.0901562106,Science & Technology - Other Topics,WOS:000271907100002,Courtney,No,,No,,Sierra Nevada,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Becky,No,Yes,No,Sierra Nevada,

Dendroecological techniques were used to reconstruct the spatiotemporal patterns of tree establishment at multiple spatial scales (local and landscape). Increases in the elevational extent of treeline and tree density above timberline were reconstructed for each decade of the 20th century. Regime-shift analysis was used to detect threshold changes in tree establishment. Marked increases in tree establishment and density occurred at local and landscape scales during the 20th century, particularly during the post-1970 period and in areas above timberline. Varying degrees of treeline advance occurred during this time, yet establishment upslope from timberline was often contingent on the availability of sheltered microsites in the lee of boulders. This highlights the importance of both broad-scale climate inputs and fine-scale site conditions in governing the rate and pattern of tree establishment in high-elevation treeline environments. Overall, the abrupt changes in tree establishment over time and space since 1970 suggest that bioclimatic thresholds can strongly influence ecotonal dynamics at upper treeline.",2012,10.2747/0272-3646.33.2.129,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Physical Geography; Geology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,WOS:000303443800002,Danny,No,Yes,No,Ecosystem/Municipal,"Glacier NP, Sierra Nevada",NA,,,,,,Micah,No,Maybe,No,"Bighorn Mts, MT/WY",Becky,No,Yes,No,"Great Basin National Park, Nevada.

Although specialist species were often restricted to isolated refugia by Pleistocene climate change, generalist species may have been less constrained in their distribution and movements. We used a combination of genetic data and previously published fossil data to investigate the phylogeography and contemporary population structure of a generalist species, the striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis). We sequenced a portion of the mitochondrial cytochrome-b gene (601 base pairs) and amplified 8 microsatellite loci from 314 striped skunk specimens. Phylogenetic analysis of the cytochrome-b gene revealed the presence of 4 distinct phylogroups, and examination of microsatellite data indicated a pattern of secondary contact among these clades. We infer from these data that during the Rancholabrean stage prior to the Illinoian glaciation, striped skunks emerged from a southern refugium in the Texas Mexico region and colonized the southeastern United States, forming a 2nd, later refugium in the east. This colonization was followed by a 2nd dispersal event from the southern source population to west of the Rocky Mountains during the Illinoian glacial period. During the Sangamonian interglacial stage, 2 distinct subclades formed on either side of the Sierra Nevada. During the Holocene, the subclade that colonized the Great Basin then expanded east across the northern Rockies and recolonized the Great Plains to create an area of secondary contact with the southern phylogroup. Secondary contact occurred to a lesser extent with individuals from the eastern phylogroup east of the Mississippi River. It appears that periodic Pleistocene glacial expansions and retreats caused a series of range expansions and secondary contact events in this native North American species to create a complex pattern of population structure today.",2012,10.1644/10-MAMM-A-270.1,Zoology,WOS:000300598700004,Danny,No,No,No,Biome/National,,NA,,,,,,Courtney,No,,No,,Becky,No,Yes,No,national,

In this study we investigated the biotic interactions (competition) between species, the influence of disturbance type, and changes in resource availability (moisture and light) on the response of six tree species to climate change in the northwest region of central British Columbia, Canada. Two ecological models were parameterized, linked together and coupled to climate change scenarios to explore the interactions between: (1) the response of species in the regeneration phase and (2) the role of disturbance, resource availability and competition on determining stand composition and productivity. Climate change was found to reduce soil moisture availability which resulted in a decline in regeneration potential for all species on dry sites and negative to neutral responses on sites with higher water availability. Following fire, stand dynamics and composition were modeled to undergo significant changes under the 2080s climate compared to current climate conditions on dry and mesic sites. Changes in stand dynamics under climate change were marginal following bark beetle disturbances. While significant changes to stand dynamics were found on dry sites, the presented results suggest that the sites with the highest moisture availability maintain the same general stand dynamics and composition following disturbances under climate change.

High-severity fires that burned 120-300 years ago initiated even-aged cohorts of fast-growing lodgepole pine at each of the six study sites. Evidence of subsequent, low-to-moderate-severity fires included single and double fire scars on thin-barked lodgepole pine that were as small as 3.6 cm in diameter at the time of the fire, but survived. These low-to-moderate-severity fires resulted in structurally complex stands with a broad range of tree diameters and multiple cohorts of lodgepole pine, white and black spruce, and subalpine fir. At the site level, fire return intervals were variable, ranging from 29 to 167 years, but most were <80 years. Of the 9 years in which we documented low-to-moderate-severity fires, only the fires in 1889 and 1915 scarred trees at more than one site, indicating that these fires were small and had local effects. The new knowledge of historical, low-to-moderate-severity fires provided by this study has important implications for ecologically sustainable forest management. Although we recognize that further research needs to determine the extent of low-to-moderate-severity fires at the landscape scale, our results clearly indicate that a mixed-severity fires occurred at least locally. A broader range of silvicultural systems than is currently practiced would be consistent with historic forest dynamics. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This area has been the location of 9 previous marten surveys during 1980-1993, each involving a systematic detection/non-detection survey on the same grid. These data are a time series of information on the occupancy of martens that can be related to habitat change in the study area. Our objectives were to 1) resurvey martens in SEF using methodology similar to previous studies to assess current marten occupancy; 2) evaluate changes in marten occupancy during the period 1980-2008; and 3) examine associations between marten occurence and changes in habitat and landscape metrics. Current marten occupancy was estimated using surveys conducted in summer 2007, winter 2007-2008, and summer 2008. From 1978 to 2007 there was a decrease in predicted habitat patch size, core area, and total amount of marten habitat in the study area, as well as an increase in distance between patches. Marten detections in 2007-2008 were approximately 60% lower than in surveys in the 1980s. We detected no martens in the summers of 2007 and 2008, and 10 detections in winter 2007-2008 were limited to higher elevations in the southwestern portion of SEF. No martens were detected in the lower elevations where most of the recent forest management activity occurred. We suggest that the marten population at SEF has been negatively affected by the loss and fragmentation of habitat. We recommend that future management of forests in the Sagehen basin focus on restoring and connecting residual marten habitat to improve habitat quality for martens.

The dynamical downscaling was performed to both the GFS (Global forecast model) reanalysis (called GFS-WRF runs) from 2000-2006 and PCM (Parallel Climate Model) simulations (called PCM-WRF runs) from 1997-2006 and 2047-2056. The downscaling results were first validated by comparing current model outputs with the observational analysis PRISM (Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model) dataset. In general, the dominant features from GFS-WRF runs and PCM-WRF runs were consistent with each other, as well as with PRISM results. The influences of climate change on the California and Nevada regions can be inferred from the model future runs. The averaged temperature showed a positive trend in the future, as in other studies. The temperature increases by around 1-2A degrees C under the assumption of business as usual over 50 years. This leads to an upward shifting of the freezing level (the contour line of 0A degrees C temperature) and more rain instead of snow in winter (December, January, and February). More hot days (> 32.2A degrees C or 90A degrees F) and extreme hot days (> 37.8A degrees C or 100A degrees F) are predicted in the Sacramento Valley and the southern parts of California and Nevada during summer (June, July, and August).

The range was extensively glaciated during the late Pleistocene. However, the postglacial paleoecologic history of the highest range in southern Europe is nearly completely unknown. Here we use sediments from a small lake above present treeline - Laguna de Rio Seco at 3020 m elevation - in a paleoecological study documenting over 11,500 calendar years of vegetation, fire and climate change, addressing ecological and paleoclimatic issues unique to this area through comparison with regional paleoecological sequences. The early record is dominated by Pinus pollen, with Betula, deciduous Quercus, and grasses, with an understory of shrubs. It is unlikely that pine trees grew around the lake, and fire was relatively unimportant at this site during this period. Aquatic microfossils indicate that the wettest conditions and highest lake levels at Laguna de Rio Seco occurred before 7800 cal yr BR This is in contrast to lower elevation sites, where wettest conditions occurred after ca 7800. Greater differences in early Holocene seasonal insolation may have translated to greater snowpack and subsequently higher lake levels at higher elevations, but not necessarily at lower elevations, where higher evaporation rates prevailed. With declining seasonality after ca 8000 cal yr BP, but continuing summer precipitation, lake levels at the highest elevation site remained high, but lake levels at lower elevation sites increased as evaporation rates declined. Drier conditions commenced regionally after ca 5700 cal yr BP, shown at Laguna de Rio Seco by declines in wetland pollen, and increases in high elevation steppe shrubs common today (Juniperus. Artemisia, and others). The disappearance or decline of mesophytes, such as Betula from ca 4000 cal yr BP is part of a regional depletion in Mediterranean Spain and elsewhere in Europe from the mid to late Holocene. On the other hand, Castanea sativa increased in Laguna de Rio Seco record after ca 4000 cal yr BP, and especially in post-Roman times, probably due to arboriculture. Though not as important at high than at low elevations, fire occurrence was elevated, particularly after ca 3700 years ago, in response to regional human population expansion. The local and regional impact of humans increased substantially after ca 2700 years ago, with the loss of Pinus forest within the mountain range, increases in evidence of pasturing herbivores around the lake, and Olea cultivation at lower elevations. Though human impact was not as extensive at high elevation as at lower elevation sites in southern Iberia, this record confirms that even remote sites were not free of direct human influence during the Holocene.

The results suggest that the effects of mountains and ice sheets on the buoyancy and momentum transfer from the atmosphere to the surface ocean determine the present pattern of deep ocean circulation. Higher mountains reduce water vapor transport from the Pacific and Indian Oceans into the Atlantic Ocean and contribute to increased (decreased) salinities and enhanced (reduced) deepwater formation and meridional overturning circulation in the Atlantic (Pacific). Orographic effects also lead to the observed interhemispheric asymmetry of midlatitude zonal wind stress. The presence of the Antarctic ice sheet cools winter air temperatures by more than 20 degrees C directly above the ice sheet and sets up a polar meridional overturning cell in the atmosphere. The resulting increased meridional temperature gradient strengthens midlatitude westerlies by similar to 25% and shifts them poleward by similar to 10 degrees. This leads to enhanced and poleward-shifted upwelling of deep waters in the Southern Ocean, a stronger Antarctic Circumpolar Current, increased poleward atmospheric moisture transport, and more advection of high-salinity Indian Ocean water into the South Atlantic.

This paper compiles terrestrial and marine proxy data from sites along the northeastern Pacific margins and proposes that they indicate 1) suppressed ENSO conditions during the middle Holocene between similar to 8000 and 4000 cal BP with a North Pacific that generally resembled a La Nina-like or more negative PDO phase and 2) a climate transition between similar to 4200 and 3000 cal BP that appears to be the teleconnected expression to a more modern-like ENSO Pacific. Compared to modern day conditions, the compiled data suggest that during the middle Holocene, the Aleutian Low was generally weaker during the winter and/or located more to the west, while the North Pacific High was stronger during the summer and located more to the north. Coastal upwelling off California was more enhanced during the summer and fall but suppressed during the spring. Oregon and California sea surface temperatures (SSTs) were cooler. The Santa Barbara Basin had an anomalous record, suggesting warmer SSTs. Late Holocene records indicate a more variable, El Nino-like, and more positive PDO Pacific. The Aleutian Low became more intensified during the winter and/or located more to the east. The North Pacific High became weaker and/or displaced more to the south. Coastal upwelling off California intensified during the spring but decreased during the fall. Oregon and California SSTs became warmer, recording the shoreward migration of sub-tropical gyre waters during the fall, while spring upwelling (cooler SST) increased in the Santa Barbara Basin. The high-resolution proxy records indicate enhanced ENSO and PDO variability after similar to 4000 cal BP off southern California, similar to 3400 cal BP off northern California, and by similar to 2000 cal BP in southwestern Yukon.

Hydrologists recognize that water yields could be significantly reduced in a warmer climate, with negative impacts upon regional water supplies. Weather data availability is usually sparse in alpine watersheds. Consequently, distributed alpine snow hydrology models are generally limited to small instrumented watersheds. Such models are unable to simulate the timing and magnitude of spring streamflow at a sufficient spatial scale for watershed management. In this study, the Simulated Grid microclimate model (SIMGRID) was refined and applied to the simulation of snow water equivalent (SWE) and spring streamflow volume in the headwaters of the St. Mary basin of northern Montana. Relationships between winter precipitation and elevation were derived from snow survey data. The SWE mass balance algorithm was enhanced to include the effect of rain-on-snow conditions, and to differentiate between snowmelt and rainfall runoff. Multiple regression analysis was used to relate predicted SWE and rainfall runoff to observed stream discharge (Q(s)) at Babb, MT, for the 1961-1990 period. The refined SIMGRID model was then applied to the 1991-2004 period, and accurately simulated spring discharge (linear regression, r(2) = 0.67).

Observations of snow water equivalent characteristics were compared to observations in streamflow characteristics.

We incorporated temperature gradients and land-cover data from the current ranges of species in a model of range shifts in response to climate change. We tested four possible scenarios of amphibian movement on a tropical mountain: movement upslope through and to land cover suitable for the species; movement upslope to land-cover types that will not sustain survival and reproduction; movement upslope to areas that previously were outside the species' range; and movement upslope to cooler areas within the current range. Areas in the final scenario will become isolated as climate continues to change. In our scenarios more than 30% of the range of 21 of 46 amphibian species in the tropical Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta is likely to become isolated as climate changes.

A relationship between median glacier elevation, minimal elevation, the general elevation of the surrounding mountains and mean climatic values was found. In the Austrian Alps, the existence of glaciers at low elevations can only be maintained with above-average accumulation or strong dynamic ice supply. For debris-free glaciers, we found a limit of similar to 2080 m a.s.l., where mean summer temperatures (June-August) exceed 4 degrees C. Glacier changes from 1969 to 1998 are strongly negative both in relative area and in mean thickness. There is a weak and regionally varying negative trend in precipitation over this period. A spatially consistent sequence of positive temperature anomalies in the early 1980s and after 1990 offers an explanation for the retreat.

The climate reconstruction, based on the Modern Analogue Technique, indicates warmer and drier conditions during the Medieval Warm Period (MWP). MWP was preceded by a short-lived cold humid event around AD 1060, and followed by a rapid return around AD 1400 to cooler and wetter conditions which generally characterize the Little Ice Age (LIA). Around AD 1450 (solar Sporer minimum), the LIA attained a temperature minimum and a summer precipitation maximum. The solar Maunder minimum around AD 1690 corresponded at Joux to rather mild temperatures but maximal annual precipitation. These results generally agree with other records from neighbouring Alpine regions. However, there are differences in the timing of the LIA temperature minimum depending on the proxy and/or the method used for the reconstruction. As a working hypothesis, the hydrological signal associated with the MWP and LIA oscillations at Lake Joux may have been mainly driven by a shift around AD 1400 from positive to negative NAO modes in response to variations in solar irradiance possibly coupled with changes in the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation.

We applied both approaches to the extensively allocated Oldman River Basin that drains the North American Rocky Mountains and provides an international focus for water sharing. For ETP, we analysed monthly discharges from 1912 to 2008 with non-parametric regression, and extrapolated changes to 2055. For modelling, we refined the physical models MTCLIM and SNOPAC to provide water inputs into RIVRQ (river discharge), a model that assesses the streamflow regime as involving dynamic peaks superimposed on stable baseflow. After parameterization with 1960-1989 data, we assessed climate forecasts from six GCMs: CGCM1-A, HadCM3, NCAR-CCM3, ECHAM4 and 5 and GCM2. Modelling reasonably reconstructed monthly hydrographs (R-2 about 0.7), and averaging over three decades closely reconstructed the monthly pattern (R-2 = 0.94). When applied to the GCM forecasts, the model predicted that summer flows would decline considerably, while winter and early spring flows would increase, producing a slight decline in the annual discharge (-3%, 2005-2055). The ETP predicted similarly decreased summer flows but slight change in winter flows and greater annual flow reduction (-9%). The partial convergence of the seasonal flow projections increases confidence in a composite analysis and we thus predict further declines in summer (about -15%) and annual flows (about -5%). This composite projection indicates a more modest change than had been anticipated based on earlier GCM analyses or trend projections that considered only three or four decades. For other river basins, we recommend the utilization of ETP based on the longest available streamflow records, and HCM with multiple GCMs. The degree of correspondence from these two independent approaches would provide a basis for assessing the confidence in projections for future river flows and surface water supplies.

Relative to live trees, dead trees over their lifetimes had higher series sensitivity, grew more variably, and had lower growth. Although droughts recurred during the 20th century, tree mortality occurred only in the late 1980s. Significant correlations and interactions of growth and mortality dates with temperature and precipitation indicate that conditions of warmth plus sustained drought increased the likelihood of mortality in the 1985-1995 interval. This resembles a global-change-type drought, where warming combined with drought was an initial stress, trees were further weakened by dwarf mistletoe (Arceuthobium cyanocarpum (A. Nels. ex Rydb.) A.

Healthy river conditions through sufficient flows and optimal temperatures are of paramount importance for the survival of Pacific salmon, which migrate upriver toward the headwaters to spawn near the end of their lives. Trends have been detected which indicate that the annual flow and summer temperature have been increasing since the middle of the last century. In this study we examine the observed trend in summer temperature of the Fraser River and compare it with temperatures calculated as part of a global climate model (GCM) simulation in which atmospheric greenhouse gases are increasing. We then use the GCM to consider how these trends might continue through the present century. Both the observations and model indicate that during the Last half of the 20th century, the summer temperature near the river mouth has been increasing at a rate of approximately 0.12 degrees C per decade in August. In this study we use an online method in which river temperatures are calculated directly as part of a GCM simulation and project how summer temperature near the mouth of the Fraser River might change by the end of the present century. The results indicate that between 2000 and 2100 river temperatures will increase in all summer months with a maximum increase of 0.14 degrees C per decade in August. This result is consistent with an offline modeling study by [Morrison, J., Quick, M.C., Goreman, M.G.G. 2002. Climate change in the Fraser River watershed: flow and temperature projections. Journal of Hydrology, 263, 230-244] in which they used output from two GCMS to drive a hydrologic model and predict future changes in river temperature and supports their contention that the timing and magnitude of the increase could be crucial for salmon migration.

A GIS-based model was used to assess the sensitivity of glaciation in different ranges to climatic change and the combinations of temperature and precipitation change necessary to sustain the last glacial maximum (LGM) extent of glaciation in each range. Extensive glaciation initiates first in the Wind River Range of Wyoming under every climate change scenario tested. In absence of precipitation change a summer temperature depression of 6-8 degrees C would be necessary to maintain LGM ice extents in Colorado and Wyoming. If precipitation was halved, necessary summer temperature depression would be 8-10 degrees C; if precipitation was doubled, a depression of 3.5-5.5 degrees C would suffice. Given model uncertainties, these values may underestimate necessary temperature depression by as much as 2 C. Under all scenarios tested, LGM glaciation in Utah, particularly the Wasatch Range, requires either more temperature depression for given precipitation change, or more precipitation for a given temperature depression than is required in the Colorado/Wyoming Rockies. A summer temperature depression of 7 degrees C, which would suffice to sustain LGM ice extent with little change from modern precipitation in the Colorado/Wyoming Rockies, would need to be coupled with a near doubling of precipitation to maintain LGM ice extent in the Wasatch Range. This difference appears to reflect LGM precipitation enhancement in the Wasatch Range, and to a lesser degree the Uinta Mountains, resulting from the presence of Lake Bonneville immediately upwind of these ranges.

The timing, rate, and extent of tree invasion can depend on interactions among topography, positive spatial feedbacks, and temporally variable factors (especially climate, grazing, and fire). Here we examine spatial and temporal patterns of tree invasion in the Valles Caldera of the Jemez Mountains. Location This study was conducted in the Valles Caldera (35 degrees 50'-36 degrees 00' N; 106 degrees 24'-106 degrees 37' W), a 24-km-wide volcanic basin in northern New Mexico, USA. Grasslands in this otherwise forested region occur in broad valley bottoms of the caldera floor between 2575 and 2700 m, and on south-facing slopes and mountain tops up to 3300 m. Methods We used a GIS analysis of orthorectified aerial photos taken in 1935 and 1996, covering a 40,000-ha study area, to quantify the extent of tree invasion and to assess its relationship to spatial factors. We obtained dates of establishment from 299 increment cores and basal disks from 50 sites in the Valles Caldera National Preserve (VCNP) to reconstruct temporal patterns of tree invasion. Results The area of grasslands in our study area declined from 11,747 to 9336 ha (nearly 18%) between 1935 and 1996. Tree invasion increased with slope, elevation, and proximity to the previous tree line, but showed no relationship to aspect. Tree invasion was more rapid and continuous on upper mountain slopes, while the invasion of valley-bottom grasslands below reversed tree lines was more episodic, and appeared to track mean summer minimum temperatures. Main conclusions The rapid and continuous invasion of steep, high-elevation slopes suggests that frequent fire was the single most important factor in maintaining grassy communities in these sites. The slower, episodic invasion of valley-bottom grasslands, and the apparent relationship between increased invasion and years of higher summer minimum temperatures are consistent with the hypothesis that these grasslands have been maintained by low temperatures or frosts damaging to tree seedlings. We encourage prescribed fire to restore and maintain grasslands in the VCNP, especially small patches on steep, high-elevation slopes.",2007,10.1111/j.1365-2699.2006.01660.x,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Physical Geography,WOS:000245693700015,Meghan,No,,Yes,,,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Becky,No,Yes,No,New Mexico,

The species is now extinct in Nevada and reduced to tiny remnants in southern California, where as a distinct population segment, it is classified as Endangered. Introduced predators (trout), air pollution and an infectious disease (chytridiomycosis) threaten remaining populations. A Bayesian analysis of 1901 base pairs of mitochondrial DNA confirms the presence of two deeply divergent clades that come into near contact in the Sierra Nevada. Morphological studies of museum specimens and analysis of acoustic data show that the two major mtDNA clades are readily differentiated phenotypically. Accordingly, we recognize two species, Rana sierrae, in the northern and central Sierra Nevada, and R. muscosa, in the southern Sierra Nevada and southern California. Existing data indicate no range overlap. These results have important implications for the conservation of these two species as they illuminate a profound mismatch between the current delineation of the distinct population segments (southern California vs. Sierra Nevada) and actual species boundaries. For example, our study finds that remnant populations of R. muscosa exist in both the southern Sierra Nevada and the mountains of southern California, which may broaden options for management. In addition, despite the fact that only the southern California populations are listed as Endangered, surveys conducted since 1995 at 225 historic (1899-1994) localities from museum collections show that 93.3% (n=146) of R. sierrae populations and 95.2% (n=79) of R. muscosa populations are extinct.

The snow variables considered were the seasonally averaged new snow sum, snow depth and snow days for winter (DJF) in the period 1958-1999. Three major patterns of large-scale snow variability were identified. The first pattern explains similar to 50 % of total variance and extends over the entire area except the southernmost parts. The second pattern explains similar to 15 % of total variance and has a dipole structure with a maximum on the northern and a strong minimum on the southern slope of the Alps. The third pattern (similar to 10 % of total variance) is height dependent with a strong maximum at lowland stations and a minimum at high stations. In contrast to the first and second pattern, the third pattern's time component shows a distinct trend. It is well correlated with the 0 degrees C isotherm which increased from similar to 600 m a.s.l. in the 1960s to similar to 900 m a.s.l. in the late 1990s and could be related to climate change. Variability in the first new snow sum pattern was primarily related to total precipitation anomalies. In contrast, variability in the first snow day pattern was primarily related to temperature anomalies. The dominance of precipitation for new snow sums and the dominance of temperature for snow days is physically consistent with the former being controlled by accumulation only and the latter by accumulation and ablation. The surface pressure anomaly pattern linked to the first new snow sum pattern is centred over southeastern Europe, resembling the Euro-Atlantic blocking pattern. For snow days the corresponding pressure anomaly is shifted further southeastward.

The thermal regime of rivers plays an important role in the overall health of aquatic ecosystems, including water quality issues and the distribution of aquatic species within the river environment. Consequently, for conducting environmental impact assessments as well as for effective fisheries management, it is important to understand the thermal behaviour of rivers and related heat exchange processes. 2. This study reviews the different river thermal processes responsible for water temperature variability on both the temporal (e.g. diel, daily, seasonal) and spatial scales, as well as providing information related to different water temperature models currently found in the literature. 3. Water temperature models are generally classified into three groups: regression, stochastic and deterministic models. Deterministic models employ an energy budget approach to predict river water temperature, whereas regression and stochastic models generally rely on air to water temperature relationships. 4. Water temperature variability can occur naturally or as a result of anthropogenic perturbations, such as thermal pollution, deforestation, flow modification and climate change. Literature information is provided on the thermal regime of rivers in relation to anthropogenic impacts and such information will contribute to the better protection of fish habitat and more efficient fisheries management.",2006,10.1111/j.1365-2427.2006.01597.x,Marine & Freshwater Biology,WOS:000239600400001,Meghan,Maybe,Yes,No,Global/International,General thermal respnses of rivers to abiotic charactersitics,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Becky,No,Yes,No,,

In this paper, the prehistoric record for pikas in the Great Basin is used to place these losses in deeper historical context. Location The Great Basin, or area of internal drainage, of the western United States. Methods The location, elevation, and age of all reported prehistoric Great Basin specimens of American pikas were extracted from the literature. Elevations of extinct pika populations were arrayed through time, and latitudes and longitudes of those populations used to determine changing distances of those populations from the nearest extant populations. Results The average elevation of now-extinct Great Basin pika populations during the late Wisconsinan (c. 40,000-10,000 radiocarbon years ago) and early Holocene (c. 10,000-7500 years ago) was 1750 m. During the hot and dry middle Holocene (c. 7500-4500 years ago), the average elevation of these populations rose 435 m, to 2168 m. All prehistorically known late Holocene (c. 4500-200 years ago) populations in the Great Basin are from mountain ranges that currently support populations of this animal, but historic period losses have caused the average elevation of pika populations to rise an additional 152 m. The total elevational increase, from the late Wisconsinan and early Holocene to today, has been 783 m. As lower elevation pika populations were lost, their distribution increasingly came to resemble its modern form. During the late Wisconsinan, now-extinct pika populations were located an average of 170 km from the nearest extant population. By the late Holocene, this distance had declined to 30 km. Main conclusions Prehistoric alterations in the distribution of pika population in the Great Basin were driven by climate change and attendant impacts on vegetation. Today, Great Basin pikas contend with both climate change and anthropogenic impacts and thus may be on the brink of extinction.",2005,10.1111/j.1365-2699.2005.01341.x,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Physical Geography,WOS:000233408500005,Meghan,No,Yes,No,Landscape/State-Province,Vocus is about the historical dist.'n of the Great Basin Pika's range may have crossed the watershed divide between great basin and CRB,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Becky,No,Yes,No,great basin,

Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) (exposed or blocked), temperature (6 degrees C and 14 degrees C), and nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, and nitrogen plus phosphor-us) were manipulated in a factorial design to determine how these factors interact to affect phytoplankton growth. Four major phytoplankton taxa (two diatoms, one chrysophyte, and one dinoflagellate) were found in the water samples across all treatments. Greater growth rates were observed at the higher temperature for all taxa, except the chrysophyte. UVR depressed the growth rates of all phytoplankton at 6 degrees C regardless of nutrient conditions. In contrast, at 14 degrees C, a negative effect of UVR was not observed for any species in the absence of nutrient additions; only with the addition of nutrients did UVR exposure depress the growth of one diatom species and the dinoflagellate. Our results suggest that in alpine lakes, the effects of UVR exposure on phytoplankton depend on temperature and nutrient availability, indicating that climate change and enhanced atmospheric nitrogen deposition are likely to alter UV-temperature-nutrient relationships of plankton in high-UV systems.",2005,,Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,WOS:000231932800003,Meghan,No,Yes,No,Ecosystem/Municipal,beartooth mountians on the east side of the Continental divide,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Becky,No,Yes,No,,

Caves dated by Al-26/Be-10 in buried sediments reveal that river incision rates were moderate to slow between c. 5 and 3 Ma (<= 0.07 mm a(-1)), accelerated between 3 and 1.5 Ma (c. 0.3 ram a(-1)), and then have subsequently become much slower (c. 0.02 mm a(-1)). Although the onset of accelerated incision coincides in time with both,postulated Pliocene tectonism and pronounced global climate change, we argue that it primarily represents the response to a discrete tectonic event between 3 and 5 Ma. Dated cave positions reveal that, prior to 3 Ma, river canyons displayed up to 1.6 km of local relief, suggesting that Pliocene rock uplift elevated pre-existing topography. Renewed incision beginning c. 3 Ma deepened canyons by up to 400 m, creating narrow inner gorges. Tributary streams exhibit strong convexities, indicating that the transient erosional response to Pliocene uplift has not yet propagated into upland surfaces. Concentrations of Al-26 and Be-10 in bare bedrock show that upland surfaces are eroding at slow rates of c. 0.01 mm a(-1). Over the past c. 3 Ma, upland surfaces eroded slowly while adjacent rivers incised rapidly, increasing local relief. Although relief production probably drove at least modest crestal uplift, considerable pre-Pliocene relief and low spatially averaged erosion rates suggest that climatically driven rock uplift is not sufficient to explain ail uplift implied by tilted markers at the western edge of the range. Despite the recent pulse of erosion, spatially averaged erosion rates are low, and have probably acted to preserve the broad topographic form of the Sierra Nevada throughout much of the late Cenozoic.

Interpretation of the stratigraphy and optically stimulated luminescence ages of eolian and nearby alluvial deposits, their pollen, and intercalated paleosols yields the following history: (1) Eolian deposition at ca. 46 ka, followed by several episodes of alluviation from some time before ca. 40 ka until after 16 ka (calibrated). (2) Eolian deposition from ca. 17 ka to 12 ka, interrupted by periods of pedogenesis, coinciding with late Pleistocene alluviation as local climate became warmer and wetter. (3) A wetter period from 12 to 8.5 ka corresponding to the peak of summer monsoon influence, during which soils formed relatively quickly by infiltration of eolian silt and clay, and trees and grasses were more abundant. (4) A drier period between ca. 8.5 and 6 ka during which sheetwash deposits accumulated and more desertlike vegetation was dominant; some dunes were reactivated at ca. 8 ka. (5) Episodic eolian and fluvial deposition during a wetter, cooler period that began at ca. 6 ka and ended by ca. 3-2 ka, followed by a shift to drier modern conditions; localized mobilization of dune sand has persisted to the present. These interpretations are similar to those of studies at the Chaco dune field, New Mexico, and the Tusayan dune field, Arizona, and are consistent with paleoclimate interpretations of pollen and packrat middens in the region. A period of rapid deposition and infiltration of eolian dust derived from distant igneous source terranes occurred between ca. 12 and 8 ka. Before ca. 17 ka, and apparently back to at least 45 ka, paleosols contain little or no such infiltrated dust.

In this study, timing and magnitude characteristics of the average annual hydrographs of five glacierized and four nival catchments in the Southwestern Canadian subarctic are empirically identified and compared. Likely effects upon fish habitat are qualitatively assessed, and net fisheries potential is tentatively investigated using taxa richness data. The chief hydrological conclusions at P < 0.05 using Kolmogorov-Smirnov and empirical orthogonal function analyses are: (1) catchment glacial cover results in freshets that are longer, larger, and peak later than those experienced by the nival regime; (2) the winter baseflows of glacial rivers are also much higher on a unit-catchment-area basis; and (3) basin scale and degree of catchment glacial cover are of comparable importance in determining the magnitude of the annual hydrologic cycle. These differences arise from the greater availability, both in volume and over time, Of meltwater in glacial catchments, which in part reflects the consistently negative alpine glacial mass balances observed both in the present study area and globally under historical climatic warming. Such regime distinctions result in increased spawning season and winter aquatic habitat availability, which may in turn offset negative habitat characteristics previously identified for glacial river ecosystems. While previous studies have suggested that glacial influences tend to decrease macroinvertebrate diversity and increase salmon populations, preliminary analysis of available fish species presence/absence data from the current study area tentatively appears to suggest similar or, perhaps, slightly higher fish taxa richness relative to nival streams; in all three cases, however, catchment lake cover may play a key hydroecological modifying role. The results strongly confirm and extend existing understanding of glacial-nival regime differences with respect to both streamflow and fisheries ecology, and raise new questions for future research.

The floods commenced after decades of downwasting and retreat of the glacier from its Holocene maximum position, which it achieved in the nineteenth century. Hydrometric data and other records are used to reconstruct the times and peak discharges of floods from two glacier-dammed lakes. Tulsequah Lake formed in the early 1900s when a tributary glacier separated from Tulsequah Glacier, creating an ice-free embayment between the two. The lake grew rapidly in surface area and volume in the first half of the twentieth century, but later, with continued glacier retreat, it decreased in size. The first jokulhlaups from Tulsequah Lake were the largest. Peak and total discharges decreased as the lake became smaller. Today, Tulsequah Lake is small, and it will disappear completely if Tulsequah Glacier retreats any further. A second lake (Lake No Lake), however, has formed and grown in size as Tulsequah Lake has diminished. Lake No Lake developed from a subglacial water body in a tributary valley, 7 km upglacier from Tulsequah Lake. Like Tulsequah Lake, Lake No Lake rapidly grew in area and volume during its youth, and in the 1970s it began to generate its own jokulhlaups. Lake No Lake appears to be following the same evolutionary path as Tulsequah Lake - its volume is now decreasing due to downwasting of Tulsequah Glacier, and its jokulhlaups are beginning to diminish. As Tulsequah Glacier continues to shrink in response to climatic warming, additional glacier-dammed lakes may form, renewing the cycle of outburst flood activity. Such behaviour can be expected in other high mountains because most alpine glaciers are retreating in response to global warming.",2005,10.1191/0959683605hl812rr,Physical Geography; Geology,WOS:000227733400014,Meghan,No,Maybe,No,,,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Becky,No,Yes,No,Tulsequah Glacier in northwestern British Columbia,

The <63 mum fraction is emphasized for its relative mobility and ease of analysis using instrumental neutron activation. Overall, the composition of the stream sediments closely reflects bedrock distribution. Samples dominated by limestone and dolostone, calcite and dolomite, and related elements (Ca, Mg, Sr etc.) correspond to Lower and Middle Cambrian carbonate bedrock largely confined to the Moose River sub-basin. Clastic and non-quartzite metamorphic lithologies, primary and secondary aluminosilicate minerals and related elements (Al, Cs, Rb etc.) are largely derived from Miette Group bedrock and associated with the uppermost Fraser River sub-basin. Except in the case of the Moose River/Fraser River junction, the determination of proportional tributary contributions is complicated by variable or delayed mixing, localized floodplain or valley side sources, and limited contrast between source areas. At present the Moose River sub-basin contributes a greater proportion of the total and fine-grained sediment loads of the combined Fraser River than would be expected from drainage basin area alone. The imbalance is related to greater relief, precipitation and runoff in the Moose River sub-basin; however, the spatial association of carbonate-rich stream sediments, ice cover and carbonate bedrock exposure indicates that glaciers play a particularly important roll in generating fine-grained fluvial sediment. Since differences in glacier cover and glacier potential in the two major sub-basins are likely to be persistent, and since relative sediment yields from the sub-basins can be determined from sediment composition, a potential indicator of glacier variation and climate change during the Holocene is therein available.

However, understanding genotypic, phenotypic and ecotypic variation is critical in determining the most suitable sources to conserve historical and functional variation. Bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) provide a classic example of restoration biology, where management programmes have re-established extirpated populations via translocations. Through this process, translocated individuals may now face novel environments, including new bioclimatic conditions and an opportunity to interbreed with historically isolated and distinct genetic units. Our goal was to integrate genetic and ecological analyses to assess some of the evolutionary ramifications of this important management practice. LocationWestern North America, but focused on the Great Basin and northern Mojave deserts. MethodsWe quantified genetic variation across 55 Herds of bighorn sheep using 16 microsatellite loci (N=347) and a mitochondrial gene (N=110). We used ordination, Bayesian clustering and phylogenetic analyses to delineate evolutionary units. We used multivariate ordination for 26 ecologically relevant variables to characterize niche-based differences among genetic clusters and then tested whether repatriated populations occupy conditions similar to source areas. ResultsWe document genetic differentiation among three traditional management units of bighorn sheep that now occupy the Great Basin and northern Mojave deserts, but also identify limited hybridization among these groups. Niche-based analyses revealed that translocated populations now occur in conditions incongruent with source ranges. Main conclusionsThis study highlights the importance of considering both genetic variation and ecological differences when implementing translocations. Early consideration of these variables may help minimize the potential for hybridization among distinct groups and mitigate challenges of managing populations experiencing novel environments. More broadly, results from this study have implications for future restoration efforts in this iconic system, but also for similar translocation-based conservation programmes.",2015,10.1111/ddi.12329,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WOS:000360099700007,Micah,No,No,No,,Great Basin,NA,,,,,,Shana,No,Yes,No,Great Basin,Becky,No,No,No,Great Basin and northern Mojave deserts,

New stratigraphic and chronological data within the lacustrine shorezone sediments of the Hogup Mountains of northwestern Utah provide some of the best evidence yet for oscillations within the overall transgressive phase of the lake. This study documents two previously unknown oscillations, hereby named the Lower Hogup (similar to 22 cal ka) and Upper Hogup (similar to 20.6 cal ka) oscillations and provides further evidence for the previously proposed U2 oscillation (similar to 21.3 cal ka). The study suggests that the water level of the lake changed dramatically (up to 25% of the lake's total volume) during the transgressive phase (similar to 30-15 cal ka). With the additional oscillations documented in this study, there are seven proposed oscillatory events during the transgressive phase of the lake. These events likely correlate to rapid but short term regional climatic fluctuations during the broader climatic trends of the Last Glacial Maximum. However, it is still unknown what specific climatic drivers are causing these oscillations and if these events can be correlated to other global climatic events. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This study investigated the development of alpine soils in relation to surficial sediments and bedrock in part of the Presidential Range of the White Mountains, New Hampshire, U.S.A. Published mapping of the study area indicates that five contrasting bedrock units are thinly mantled by glacial sediment, providing the opportunity to evaluate the relative importance of these two potential soil parent materials. Samples collected from 25 pedons were analyzed for a variety of physical, chemical, and mineralogical properties. Soil profiles have distinct Oa, A, Bw, and BC horizons. X-ray diffraction analysis reveals the presence of chlorite in soils above all bedrock formations, despite the absence of this mineral in several bedrock types. Trace element concentrations are relatively uniform for all soils with no clear relationship to underlying bedrock. Differences in median grain size are significant in soils over different bedrock formations; however, extractable cations, cation exchange capacity, exchangeable acidity, and other soil properties exhibit no significant differences. The overall similarity of soils above strongly contrasting bedrock formations indicates that these soils are forming in a homogenous mantle of glacial sediment deposited in the late Wisconsin, and that bedrock weathering does not contribute to pedogenesis to measurable degree in this setting.

In the Glaciers_cci project of the European Space Agency (ESA), three of these characteristics are investigated in detail: glacier area, elevation change and surface velocity. We use (a) data from optical sensors to derive glacier outlines, (b) digital elevation models from at least two points in time, (c) repeat altimetry for determining elevation changes, and (d) data from repeat optical and microwave sensors for calculating surface velocity. For the latter, the two sensor types provide complementary information in terms of spatio-temporal coverage.

Existing catchment models that predict stream temperature use a variety of approaches to estimate throughflow temperatures, but none has been evaluated against field measurements of throughflow temperature. In this study, throughflow temperatures were monitored over two winters at 50 locations adjacent to a headwater stream (11 ha catchment area) located in the rain-on-snow zone of the Pacific Northwest. Existing approaches to estimate throughflow temperature under or overpredicted throughflow temperatures by up to 5 degrees C, or were unable to represent the influence of transient snow cover. Therefore, a conceptual-parametric model that is computationally efficient was developed that simulates hillslope hydrology and throughflow temperatures. The model structure includes an upslope reservoir that drains into a downslope reservoir that, in turn, drains into the stream. Vertical and lateral energy and water fluxes are simulated using simplified process representations.

Nevertheless, little is known about long-term variation in salmon migration timing for multiple species across broad regions. We used long-term data for five Pacific salmon species throughout rapidly warming southeast Alaska to describe long-term changes in salmon migration timing, interannual phenological synchrony, relationships between climatic variation and migratory timing, and to test whether long-term changes in migration timing are related to glaciation in headwater streams. Temporal changes in the median date of salmon migration timing varied widely across species. Most sockeye populations are migrating later over time (11 of 14), but pink, chum, and especially coho populations are migrating earlier than they did historically (16 of 19 combined). Temporal trends in duration and interannual variation in migration timing were highly variable across species and populations. The greatest temporal shifts in the median date of migration timing were correlated with decreases in the duration of migration timing, suggestive of a loss of phenotypic variation due to natural selection. Pairwise interannual correlations in migration timing varied widely but were generally positive, providing evidence for weak region-wide phenological synchrony. This synchrony is likely a function of climatic variation, as interannual variation in migration timing was related to climatic phenomenon operating at large- (Pacific decadal oscillation), moderate- (sea surface temperature), and local-scales (precipitation). Surprisingly, the presence or the absence of glaciers within a watershed was unrelated to long-term shifts in phenology. Overall, there was extensive heterogeneity in long-term patterns of migration timing throughout this climatically and geographically complex region, highlighting that future climatic change will likely have widely divergent impacts on salmon migration timing. Although salmon phenological diversity will complicate future predictions of migration timing, this variation likely acts as a major contributor to population and ecosystem resiliency in southeast Alaska.",NA,,,,Micah,No,Yes,No,,AK,Adrienne,No,Maybe,No,,,NA,,,,,Becky,No,Yes,No,AK,

Continuous data were collected from two reaches of the Girnock Burn (a tributary of the Aberdeenshire Dee, Scotland) with contrasting land use characteristics: (1) semi-natural riparian forest and (2) open moorland. In the moorland reach, wind speed and energy fluxes (especially net radiation, latent heat and sensible heat) varied considerably between years because of variable riparian micro-climate coupled strongly to prevailing meteorological conditions. In the forested reach, riparian vegetation sheltered the stream from meteorological conditions that produced a moderated micro-climate and thus energy exchange conditions, which were relatively stable between years. Net energy gains (losses) in spring and summer (autumn and winter) were typically greater in the moorland than the forest. However, when particularly high latent heat loss or low net radiation gain occurred in the moorland, net energy gain (loss) was less than that in the forest during the spring and summer (autumn and winter) months. Spring and summer water temperature was typically cooler in the forest and characterised by less inter-annual variability due to reduced, more inter-annually stable energy gain in the forested reach. The effect of riparian vegetation on autumn and winter water temperature dynamics was less clear because of the confounding effects of reach-scale inflows of thermally stable groundwater in the moorland reach, which strongly influenced the local heat budget. These findings provide new insights as to the hydrometeorological conditions under which semi-natural riparian forest may be effective in mitigating river thermal variability, notably peaks, under present and future climates.

This area is renowned for its exceptional flora and fauna, but comparatively little is known about arthropod diversity in this region. We obtained specimens of the tarantula genus Aphonopelma from five different mountain ranges (Huachucas, Pajaritos, Peloncillos, Santa Catalinas, and Santa Ritas) to assess patterns of diversity within the group. Species delimitation in tarantulas is difficult because they possess few informative morphological features. We implemented a rigorous methodological framework for delimiting species that incorporated multiple lines of evidence (molecules, distributional information, morphology, and breeding period) in an explicitly hypothesis-driven manner. Our integrative taxonomic approach delimited three species (all undescribed): one endemic to the Peloncillos, one endemic to the Santa Catalinas, and one that is more widely distributed in the Huachucas, Santa Ritas, and Pajaritos. These patterns of diversity and endemicity are comparable to other arachnids in the region and suggest that species-level diversity of stenotypic/dispersal-limited arthropods throughout the Madrean Sky Island Region may be underestimated. Ecological data are not widely available for Madrean Sky Island tarantulas and it is difficult to evaluate their conservation status. Several intrinsic (patterns of endemicity, limited vagility, and life history) and extrinsic (habitat degradation, commercial exploitation, and climate change) factors, however, suggest that these spiders may be of conservation concern. The approach taken in this study highlights the importance of considering multiple lines of evidence when species delimitation has direct implications on conservation.",2015,10.1111/icad.12089,Biodiversity & Conservation; Entomology,WOS:000351085900003,Micah,No,Yes,No,,Mexico,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Becky,No,No,International,Mexico,

To track changing glacier and perennial snow surface area over the past century we used historic maps, aerial photography, and geologic evidence evident in said imagery. Since the end of the Little Ice Age (similar to 1900), when the glaciers retreated from their moraines, to 2006 the ice-covered area shrank by similar to 47%. The main driver of surface area change was air temperature, with glaciers at lower elevations shrinking faster than those at higher elevations. The total contribution of ice wastage to late summer stream flow ranged from 0.4 to 1.5%, 0.9 to 2.8%, 1.7 to 5.4%, and 3.4 to 10.9% in four different watersheds, none of which exceeded 7% glacier cover. Results from previous studies were difficult to include because of differences in interpretation of glacier boundaries, because of poor imagery, or to extensive seasonal snow. These difficulties highlight potential problems in combining data sets from different studies and underscores the importance of reexamining past observations to ensure consistent interpretation.

Automated recorders are an attractive method for monitoring birds, because they leave a record that can be independently validated and multiple units can be programmed to repeatedly survey different locations at the same daily times. We assessed the use of automated recorders and single-species, single-season occupancy models to monitor common forest birds across a 5.4-million-ha region of northern California. Using a survey protocol of 5-minute recordings at 3 times of the morning repeated over 3 consecutive days at 453 sites, we detected 32 species at >10% of these sites. Five of these species (Steller's jay [Cyanocitta stelleri], mountain chickadee [Poecile gambeli], red-breasted nuthatch [Sitta canadensis], dark-eyed junco [Junco hyemalis], and western tanager [Piranga ludoviciana]) were dominant with occupancies >0.5. We also modeled occupancy associations with elevation and canopy cover for brown creeper (Certhia americana), MacGillivray's warbler (Geothlypis tolmiei), and western tanager and found the environmental conditions at which occupancy was maximized differed by up to 399m in elevation and 17.9% canopy cover for these species. Given a sampling effort of 100 new sites per year, we demonstrated 80% power (=0.1) to detect occupancy declines as small as 2.5% per year over 20 years for the 32 most common species. The effective radius of automated recorder surveys was approximately 50m. In a field test, surveys conducted concurrently using automated recorders and point counts yielded similar occupancy estimates despite differences in detection probability. Our results suggest that automated recorders, used alone or in conjunction with point counts, can provide a practical means of monitoring common forest birds across a large geographic area.

These models are used to predict stream temperature in ungauged catchments to assess the impact of human activities or climate change on riverine fauna over large spatial areas. A comprehensive literature review presented in this study shows that the temperature metrics predicted by the majority of models correspond to yearly aggregates, such as the popular annual maximum weekly mean temperature (MWMT). As a consequence, current models are often unable to predict the annual cycle of stream temperature, nor can the majority of them forecast the inter-annual variation of stream temperature. This study presents a new statistical model to estimate the monthly mean stream temperature of ungauged rivers over multiple years in an Alpine country (Switzerland). Contrary to similar models developed to date, which are mostly based on standard regression approaches, this one attempts to incorporate physical aspects into its structure. It is based on the analytical solution to a simplified version of the energy-balance equation over an entire stream network. Some terms of this solution cannot be readily evaluated at the regional scale due to the lack of appropriate data, and are therefore approximated using classical statistical techniques. This physics-inspired approach presents some advantages: (1) the main model structure is directly obtained from first principles, (2) the spatial extent over which the predictor variables are averaged naturally arises during model development, and (3) most of the regression coefficients can be interpreted from a physical point of view - their values can therefore be constrained to remain within plausible bounds. The evaluation of the model over a new freely available data set shows that the monthly mean stream temperature curve can be reproduced with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of +/- 1.3 degrees C, which is similar in precision to the predictions obtained with a multi-linear regression model. We illustrate through a simple example how the physical aspects contained in the model structure can be used to gain more insight into the stream temperature dynamics at regional scales.",2015,10.5194/hess-19-3727-2015,Geology; Water Resources,WOS:000364327300001,Micah,No,No,No,,Switzerland,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Becky,No,Yes,International,Switzerland,

Utilizing vegetation indicators derived from remotely sensed imagery, we present an approach to forecast shifts in the future distribution of vegetation. Remotely sensed metrics representing cumulative greenness, seasonality, and minimum cover have successfully been linked to species distributions over broad spatial scales. In this paper we developed models between a historical time series of Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) satellite imagery from 1987 to 2007 at 1 km spatial resolution with corresponding climate data using regression tree modeling approaches. We then applied these models to three climate change scenarios produced by the Canadian Centre for Climate Modeling and Analysis (CCCma) to predict and map productivity indices in 2065. Our results indicated that warming may lead to increased cumulative greenness in northern British Columbia and seasonality in vegetation is expected to decrease for higher elevations, while levels of minimum cover increase. The Coast Mountains of the Pacific Maritime region and high elevation edge habitats across British Columbia were forecasted to experience the greatest amount of change.

Using ground observation of precipitation and streamflow, the skill of HRPPs and the resulting streamflow simulations from the Variable Infiltration Capacity hydrological model are cross-compared. HRPPs often capture major precipitation events but seldom capture the observed magnitude of precipitation over the studied region and period (2003-09). Bias adjustment is found to be effective in enhancing the HRPPs and resulting streamflow simulations. However, if not bias adjusted using gauges, errors are typically large as in the lower-level precipitation inputs to HRPPs. The results using collocated Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) and CloudSat precipitation data show that missing data, often over frozen land, and limitations in retrieving precipitation from systems that lack frozen hydrometeors contribute to the observed microwave-based precipitation errors transferred to HRPPs. Over frozen land, precipitation retrievals from infrared sensors and microwave sounders show some skill in capturing the observed precipitation climatology maps. However, infrared techniques often show poor detection skill, and microwave sounding in dry atmosphere remains challenging. By recognizing the sources of precipitation error and in light of the operation of the Global Precipitation Measurement mission, further opportunity for enhancing the current status of precipitation retrievals and the hydrology of cold and mountainous regions becomes available.",2014,10.1175/JAMC-D-14-0056.1,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,WOS:000346284300013,Micah,No,Yes,No,Landscape/State-Province,CA,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Becky,No,Yes,No,CA,

Physically based models, such as the shallow landslide instability prediction (SLIP) model, have many advantages because these models can assess the hazards of shallow landslides dynamically, based on physical stability equations that consider rainfall as a triggering factor. The main objective of this research is to test the SLIP model's potential to predict shallow landslide hazards in Thailand. To achieve this goal, the SLIP model was applied to two massive landslide events in Thailand. The results predicted by the SLIP model for the two study areas are outlined, and the model prediction capabilities were evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic plot. The Phetchabun results showed that the western part of the catchment had the lowest factor of safety (F-S) value, whereas the Krabi results showed that the slopes surrounding the peak of Khao Panom Mountain had the lowest F-S value, explaining the highest potentials for shallow landslides in each area. The SLIP model showed good performance: The global accuracies were 0.828 for the Phetchabun area and 0.824 for the Krabi area.

In the United States the U.S. Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program monitors the forested land base with field data collected over a permanent network of sample plots. Although these plots are visited repeatedly through time there are large temporal gaps (e.g. 5-10 years) between remeasurements such that many forest canopy disturbances go undetected. In this paper we demonstrate how Landsat time series (LTS) can help improve FIA's capacity to estimate disturbance by 1.) incorporating a new, downward looking response variable which is more sensitive to picking up change and 2.) providing historical disturbance maps which can reduce the variance of design-based estimates via post-stratification. To develop the LTS response variable a trained analyst was used to manually interpret 449 forested HA plots located in the Uinta Mountains of northern Utah, USA. This involved recording cause and timing of disturbances based on evidence gathered from a 26-year annual stack of Landsat images and an 18-year, periodically spaced set of high resolution (similar to 1 m) aerial photographs (e.g. National Aerial Image Program, NAIP and Google Earth). In general, the Landsat data captured major disturbances (e.g. harvests, fires) while the air photos allowed more detailed estimates of the number of trees impacted by recent insect outbreaks. Comparing the LTS and FIA field observations, we found that overall agreement was 73%, although when only disturbed plots were considered agreement dropped to 40%. Using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test, we compared distributions of live and disturbed tree size (height and DBH) and found that when LTS and FIA both found non-stand clearing disturbance the median disturbed tree size was significantly larger than undisturbed trees, whereas no significant difference was found on plots where only FIA detected disturbance. This suggests that LTS interpretation and FIA field crews both detect upper canopy disturbances while RA crews alone add disturbances occurring at or below canopy level. The analysis also showed that plots with only LTS disturbance had a significantly greater median number of years since last FIA measurement (6 years) than plots with both FIA and LTS disturbances (2.5 years), indicating that LTS improved detection on plots which had not been field sampled for several years. Next, to gauge the impact of incorporating LTS disturbances into the FIA estimation process we calculated design-based estimates of disturbance (for the period 1995-2011) using three response populations 1.) LTS observations, 2.) FIA field observations, and 3.) Combination of FIA and LTS observations. The results showed that combining the FIA and LTS observations led to the largest and most precise (i.e. smallest percent standard error) estimates of disturbance. In fact, the estimate based on the combined observations (486,458 ha, +/-47,101) was approximately 65% more than the estimate derived solely with FIA data (294,295 ha, +/-44,242). Lastly, a Landsat forest disturbance map was developed and tested for its ability to post-stratify the design-based estimates. Based on relative efficiency (RE), we found that stratification mostly improved the estimates derived with the LTS response data. Aside from insects (RE = 1. 26), the estimates of area affected by individual agents saw minimal gain, whereas the LTS and combined FIA + LTS estimates of total disturbance saw modest improvement, with REs of 1.43 and 1.50 respectively. Overall, our results successfully demonstrate two ways LTS can improve the completeness and precision of disturbance estimates derived from FIA inventory data.

Empirically, linking reproductive success with landscape structure and anthropogenic change is a first step in understanding and managing the spatial mechanisms that affect reproduction, but this link is not sufficiently informed by data. Hierarchical multistate occupancy models can forge these links by estimating spatial patterns of reproductive success across landscapes. To illustrate, we surveyed the occurrence of grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) in the Canadian Rocky Mountains Alberta, Canada. We deployed camera traps for 6 weeks at 54 surveys sites in different types of land cover. We used hierarchical multistate occupancy models to estimate probability of detection, grizzly bear occupancy, and probability of reproductive success at each site. Grizzly bear occupancy varied among cover types and was greater in herbaceous alpine ecotones than in low-elevation wetlands or mid-elevation conifer forests. The conditional probability of reproductive success given grizzly bear occupancy was 30% (SE = 0.14). Grizzly bears with cubs had a higher probability of detection than grizzly bears without cubs, but sites were correctly classified as being occupied by breeding females 49% of the time based on raw data and thus would have been underestimated by half. Repeated surveys and multistate modeling reduced the probability of misclassifying sites occupied by breeders as unoccupied to <2%. The probability of breeding grizzly bear occupancy varied across the landscape. Those patches with highest probabilities of breeding occupancyherbaceous alpine ecotoneswere small and highly dispersed and are projected to shrink as treelines advance due to climate warming.

We quantified the extent to which vegetation and evapo-transpiration (ET) are presently cold-limited in California's upper Kings River basin and used a space-for-time substitution to calculate the sensitivity of riverflow to vegetation expansion. We found that runoff is highly sensitive to vegetation migration; warming projected for 2100 could increase average basin-wide ET by 28% and decrease riverflow by 26%. Kings River basin ET currently peaks at midelevation and declines at higher elevation, creating a cold-limited zone above 2,400 m that is disproportionately important for runoff generation.

Over the last few decades, several papers have addressed changing forest structure in the Sierra Nevada, CA, USA, but these studies were limited in scope. We carried out a broad comparison of forest density and composition in the 1930s versus the 2000s for the west slope of the central and northern Sierra Nevada, using the two most extensive data sets available. Forests in this region have endured a long, complex history of human disturbance, and are now experiencing climatic shifts. We subdivided the landscape into elevation and latitude zones and compared historical and modern tree densities within each zone. We compared densities in historical plots to burned and unburned modern plots, as well as densities of individual tree species in historical vs. modern plots for their entire elevational distribution. Density of small trees (10.2-30.4 cm dbh) was significantly higher in the modern data set for all elevations and all latitudes, ranging from 20 to 148% higher. However, density of large trees (>= 61.0 cm) was lower in the modern data set for most elevations and latitudes, ranging from 41% to 60% lower in most zones. Density difference of mid-sized trees (30.5-60.9 cm) was mixed, but was generally higher in modern plots. The pattern of more small trees but fewer large trees held for most individual species as well, but with notable exceptions. Our comparison of burned and unburned plots strongly implicates fire suppression as a driver of increased density of small trees in low-to mid-elevation forests. However, modern high-elevation (>2500 m) forests, where fire suppression impacts should be minimal, were also significantly denser than historical plots. Changing climatic conditions may be driving increased densities of small trees in high elevations, as well as decreased densities of large trees across the region.",2014,10.1890/ES14-00103.1,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WOS:000345096900008,Micah,No,Yes,No,,CA,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Becky,No,Yes,No,CA,

These changes are especially relevant in regions that rely on water from forested areas. In this study, we present an analysis of (2005-2010) daily climate and streamflow data collected following the 2003 Lost Creek wildfire that burned the majority of the vegetated areas (>50%) of two catchments in the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains in southern Alberta, Canada. In the analysis, observed streamflow data showed 1.2 to 2.0 times higher mean annual water yield and 1.4 to 2.2 times higher mean peak flows from burned catchments compared to unburned catchments. The burned catchments did have distinct responses in seasonality, onset of peak and flow recession. Most notable was the recession, which was approximately 40% faster in the burned catchments, compared to the unburned catchments. The differences observed between the burned and unburned catchment behaviors, especially in the annual yield and peak flow, were likely due to the combined impacts of wildfire and variability in climate (precipitation) over the catchments. We used the concept of elasticity commonly applied to climate change problems to account for precipitation variability. This approach suggested an increased annual flow in the burned catchments, but changes in peak flows were not detected. Overall the impact of just wildfire to streamflow was difficult to determine and surprisingly small during this timeframe when precipitation variability over the catchments were accounted for.

Interpretations of these isotopic trends require quantitative estimates of the influence of climatic and environmental changes on delta O-18 and delta D of soil water. Here we use a coupled atmosphere-land model with water-iso-topologue tracking capabilities, ECHAM5-JSBACH-wiso, to simulate precipitation and delta O-18 responses to elevation-independent changes in Neogene geography, equator to pole temperature gradient (EPGRAD), grassland expansion, and tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures. Both precipitation and soil water delta O-18 (delta O-18(sw)) respond strongly to Neogene strengthening of the EPGRAD, but weakly to other forcings. An increase in EPGRAD leads to significant drying and O-18 enrichment (3%-5%) of soil water over the northern Sierra Nevada and central Rockies as a result of Hadley circulation strengthening and enhanced coastal subtropical subsidence. These large-scale circulation changes reduce inland moisture transport from the Pacific Ocean and Gulf of Mexico. Our simulated delta O-18(sw) responses could explain 50%-100% of the proxy delta O-18 increases over the Sierra Nevada and central Rockies, suggesting that climate change rather than surface subsidence may have been the dominant climate signal in delta O-18 records in these regions. On the contrary, delta O-18 responses to climate changes are small in the Great Basin, indicating that the observed delta O-18 increase over this region was likely a direct response to surface subsidence with elevation losses of 1-1.5 km. Adding this elevation loss to current Great Basin elevations reveals the former existence of a uniformly high plateau extending from the Sierra Nevada to the central Rockies prior to Neogene extension. This revised elevation history brings Neogene delta O-18 and delta D paleoaltimetry of the western United States in accordance with independent lines of structural evidence and early Cenozoic elevation reconstructions.",2016,10.1130/G38212.1,Geology,WOS:000386121200023,Paris,No,Yes,No,,GB,Courtney,Yes,Yes,Yes,Biome/National,"Western US, palroclimate",NA,,,,,Becky,No,Yes,No,great basin and CA,

We test the hypothesis that commonly assumed glacial sliding parameterizations control denudation rates over geologic timescales. We do this by modeling glacier dynamics over a glacial -interglacial cycle and compare with a dense dataset of (U-Th)/He thermochronometer derived denudation rates from the southern Coast Mountains, BC. Results indicate zones of rapid Quaternary erosion correspond to locations where the model predicts the highest averaged sliding velocities. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that sliding influences the rate of glacial erosion. Regression between sliding predicted by the model and erosion rates shows a statistically significant correlation (r(2) = 0.6). The coefficient of the regression (10(-5)) is smaller than previous estimates based on data from much shorter timescales. The model results also reveal that for a specific location, active subglacial sliding, and hence erosion, occurs for only similar to 10-20% of a glacial-interglacial cycle, suggesting high temporal variations in erosion rates. This intermittency of erosion requires instantaneous erosion rates to be greater than long term averages, explaining how timescale averaging can impact estimates of glacial erosion rates.

We used repeated observations on 289,390 trees in 3673 1 ha plots on U.S. Forest Service lands in Oregon and Washington to compare distributions of mortality rates among natural disturbances and vegetation zones from the mid-1990s to mid-2000s, a period characterized by drought, insect outbreaks, and large wildfires. Endogenous disturbances (e.g. pathogens, insects) were pervasive but operated at relatively low levels of mortality (<2.5%/yr) that rarely exceeded 5%/yr. Exogenous disturbances (e.g. fire, wind, landslides, avalanches) were less common and operated mostly at intermediate levels of mortality (5-25%/yr) indicative of partial-stand replacement events. Stand-replacing mortality rates (>= 25%/yr) comprised a third of all exogenous disturbance events, occurring almost exclusively in fires. Fires were rare in wet vegetation zones and most rates were <2.5%/yr and associated with endogenous processes. Mortality rates in dry vegetation zones revealed a different set of dynamics including a more variable role of background mortality and greater proportions of mortality associated with fire and insects at partial- and stand-replacing levels. Mortality rates in early and middle stages of stand development were low compared to published rates, but rates >1%/yr in over half of the plots in late and old-growth stages corroborate previous findings of elevated mortality during the same period and indicate the potential for pervasive structural change across all vegetation zones. Partial- and stand-replacing fire were associated with most mortality, but affected a relatively small proportion of dry vegetation zones (3.1-7.1% and 2.1-5.1%, respectively). These disturbances have likely affected regional biodiversity through the creation of early seral habitat, increased within-stand heterogeneity, and restored some aspects of historical fire regimes, but there is a need to better understand corresponding structural and compositional changes. We demonstrate the variability in the drivers, magnitude, and extent of mortality across a biophysically diverse region and highlight the need to incorporate and characterize the effects of mortality at intermediate levels to develop a more comprehensive understanding of regional forest dynamics.

These studies have revealed that reduced soil infiltration capacity and reduced transpiration due to tree canopy combustion increase streamflow at the watershed scale. However, the degree to which these local increases in runoff propagate to larger scales-relevant to urban and agricultural water supply-remains largely unknown, particularly in semi-arid mountainous watersheds co-dominated by winter snowmelt and the North American monsoon. To address this question, we selected three New Mexico watersheds the Jemez (1223 km(2)), Mogollon (191 km(2)), and Gila (4807 km(2))-that together have been affected by over 100 wildfires since 1982. We then applied climate-driven linear models to test for effects of fire on streamflow metrics after controlling for climatic variability. Here we show that, after controlling for climatic and snowpack variability, significantly more streamflow discharged from the Gila watershed for three to five years following wildfires, consistent with increased regional water yield due to enhanced infiltration-excess overland flow and groundwater recharge at the large watershed scale. In contrast, we observed no such increase in discharge from the Jemez watershed following wildfires. Fire regimes represent a key difference between the contrasting responses of the Jemez and Gila watersheds with the latter experiencing more frequent wildfires, many caused by lightning strikes. While hydrologic dynamics at the scale of large watersheds were previously thought to be climatically dominated, these results suggest that if one fifth or more of a large watershed has been burned in the previous three to five years, significant increases in water yield can be expected.",2016,10.1088/1748-9326/11/8/085006,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,WOS:000381828300023,Paris,No,Yes,No,,NM,Becky,No,Yes,No,,three New Mexico watersheds,NA,,,,,Becky,No,Yes,No,NM,

Fossil diatom assemblages were investigated from an 11,000-year lake sediment core from a deep, alpine lake (Lugu Hu) in southwest China, an area strongly influenced by the southwest (or the Indian) summer monsoon. Changes in diatom assemblage composition, notably the abundance of the two dominant planktonic species, Cyclotella rhomboideo-elliptica and Cyclostephanos dubius, reflect the effects of climate variability on nutrient dynamics, mediated via thermal stratification (internal nutrient cycling) and catchment vegetation processes. Statistical analyses of the climate diatom interactions highlight the strong effect of changing orbitally-induced solar radiation during the Holocene, presumably via its effect on the lake's thermal budget. In a partial redundancy analysis, climate (solar insolation) and proxies reflecting catchment process (pollen percentages, C/N ratio) were the most important drivers of diatom ecological change, showing the strong effects of climate catchment vegetation interactions on lake functioning. This diatom record reflects long-term ontogeny of the lake-catchment ecosystem and suggests that climatic changes (both temperature and precipitation) impact lake ecology indirectly through shifts in thermal stratification and catchment nutrient exports.

Warmer, wetter growing seasons may increase productivity; however, in the absence of additional precipitation, increased temperatures may decrease soil moisture, thereby diminishing any positive effect of warming. Since plant species show individual responses to environmental change, responses may depend on community composition and vary across life form or functional groups. We warmed an alpine plant community at Niwot Ridge, Colorado continuously for four years to test whether warming increases or decreases productivity of life form groups and the whole community. We provided supplemental water to a subset of plots to alleviate the drying effect of warming. We measured annual above-ground productivity and soil temperature and moisture, from which we calculated soil degree days and adequate soil moisture days. Using an information-theoretic approach, we observed that positive productivity responses to warming at the community level occur only when warming is combined with supplemental watering; otherwise we observed -decreased productivity. Watering also increased community productivity in the absence of warming. Forbs accounted for the majority of the productivity at the site and drove the contingent community response to warming, while cushions drove the generally positive response to watering and graminoids muted the community response. Warming advanced snowmelt and increased soil degree days, while watering increased adequate soil moisture days. Heated and watered plots had more adequate soil moisture days than heated plots. Overall, measured changes in soil temperature and moisture in response to treatments were consistent with expected productivity responses. We found that available soil moisture largely determines the responses of this forb-dominated alpine community to simulated climate warming.",2016,10.1890/15-1197.1,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WOS:000377219900018,Paris,No,Yes,No,,CO,NA,,,,,,Danny,No,Yes,No,"Niwot Ridge, Colorado",Becky,No,Yes,No,"Niwot Ridge, Colorado",

Individual populations of species occupy different positions in the landscape that determine their required range shift to maintain similar climate, and likewise the migration capacity depends on habitat connectivity. Here, we demonstrate an approach to quantifying species vulnerabilities to climate change for 419 rare vascular plants in Alberta, Canada, based on a multivariate velocity of climate change metric, local habitat fragmentation, and migration capacity. Climate change velocities indicated that future migration requirements ranged from 1 to 5 km/year in topographically complex landscapes, such as the Alberta Foothills and Rocky Mountains. In contrast, migration requirements to maintain constant climate in relatively flat Boreal Plains, Parkland, and Grassland ranged from 4 to 8 km/year. Habitat fragmentation was also highest in these flat regions, particularly the Parkland Natural Region. Of the 419 rare vascular plants assessed, 36 were globally threatened (G1-G3 ranking).

The combination of broad scale, regional climatic, and more localized, site-level drivers presents a challenge when upscaling phenology from the plot to the region. Likewise, developing relationships between ground- or camera-based estimates and satellite imagery remains difficult due to the trade-off between temporal and spatial resolution. Landsat imagery, with its 16 day temporal resolution, is often thought of as being insufficient for timely observation of changes in vegetation throughout the year. However the free availability of the Landsat archive has enabled a major shift in the way Landsat imagery is processed moving towards pixel, rather than scene, based analyses. In this paper we build on previous research by examining the applicability and accuracy of Landsat derived phonology curves beyond deciduous stands into more mixed stands and conifer dominated forest types in the Rocky Mountains and foothills in Alberta, Canada. In addition, we discuss the application of these Landsat phenology curves to phenology of understorey species which are linked to habitat selection for free roaming wildlife, in particular grizzly bears. The agreement between Landsat- and camera-derived estimates of key phonological events was stronger for green up (RMSE = 7 days) than for senescence (RMSE = 14 days). Our results show that yearly adjustment of green-up and senescence dates using available Landsat observations improved the agreement with camera-derived estimates when compared to average annual curves. Seasonal phonology transition dates accepted as valid ranged from 25% for alpine herbaceous pixels to 75% for closed deciduous, demonstrating the variable success of this approach across land cover types. Season transition dates were rejected if pixels lacked a strong enough green up signal in Landsat spectral indices or if the estimated dates fell outside of the valid range. We conclude by investigating the spatial patterns of seasonal phenology at the Landsat scale, and assess the relative importance of regional vs. microsite conditions as well as the utility of these data for resource and wildlife management.

The objective of this work is to analyse temperatures at the first 60 m depth of this drilling from September 2002 to August 2013 based on 11 UTL-1 thermal loggers located at different depths, together with air temperatures at the summit of the Veleta peak. Permanent negative temperatures have not been detected in the borehole, which shows evidence of the absence of widespread permafrost conditions nowadays in the highest lands of this massif. Bedrock temperatures oscillated between 3.2 degrees C at 0.6 m depth and 2 degrees C at 20 m below the surface. The largest temperature ranges were recorded on the most external sensors until 12 in depth, where values reached 22.3 degrees C. Seasonal temperature variations were significant until 10 m depth. The thickness of the seasonal frozen layer was highly variable (0.6-2 m) and dependent on annual climate conditions. The mean air temperature at the Veleta peak increased by 0.12 degrees C during the study period. Bedrock temperatures followed diverging trends: a drop of 0.3-0.4 degrees C down to 0.6 m depth, a decrease of up to 0.7 degrees C between 4 and 10 m, thermal stability at 20 m and a rise of 0.2 degrees C that occurred in 2009 at the deepest sensor at 60 m. The calculation of the thermal wave damping in the subsoil of the Veleta peak has allowed for quantitYing the thermal diffusivity of the rock as (7.05 +/- 0.03)10(-7) m(2)/s, which means that the external climate signal arrives with an 8.5-year lag to the sensor at 60 m deep.

Additional watershed characteristics were derived from GIS coverages of watershed, hydrological and climatic variables. Maximum weekly average temperature (MWAT), computed as an index of summer thermal regime, ranged from 10 to 23 degrees C. High values of MWAT were associated with large, warm, low relief watersheds with a high lake influence. Measures of community similarity suggested that the fish community changed most rapidly through a lower transition zone at an MWAT of about 12 degrees C and an upper transition zone at an MWAT of about 19 degrees C. These results were confirmed using existing fisheries inventory data combined with predictions of MWAT from a landscape-scale regression model for the Thompson River watershed. For headwater sites in the Chilcotin River watershed (which drains into the middle Fraser River), the relative dominance of bull trout versus rainbow trout (based on inventory data) decreased with increasing predicted MWAT although the distinction was not as clear as for the Thompson River sites. The fish communities in these watersheds can be characterized in terms of very cold water (bull trout and some cold water species), cold water (salmonids and sculpins) and cool water (minnows and some cold water salmonids). The two transition zones (ca 12 and 19 degrees C) can be used to identify thresholds where small changes in stream temperature can be expected to lead to large changes in fish communities. Such clear, quantifiable thresholds are critical components of a management strategy designed to identify and protect vulnerable fish communities in streams where poor land use practices, alone or in combination with climatic change, can lead to changes in stream temperatures.

Stand-scale disturbances, like fires, can suddenly improve local host susceptibility and may attract beetles; however, whether such increases can lead to outbreaks in post-disturbance stands is unclear. Using low-density Dendroctonus ponderosae mountain pine beetle populations in Pinus contorta lodgepole pine forests in western Canada, we investigated whether prescribed fires promote outbreaks or provide only short-term resources. Proportionally more burned than non-burned trees were attacked. At one site, beetle attacks increased in response to a resource pulse, but the proportions of attacked trees and numbers of attacks per tree declined over fouryears after fire. Elsewhere, beetle attacks remained very low. As the resource (phloem) quality of burned trees remained high threeyears after fire, we propose that post-fire mortality, resulting in fewer available host trees, can at least partially explain why D.ponderosae did not build up populations in burned stands.Synthesis and applications. Our study emphasizes the importance of examining long-term trends in fire-bark beetle interactions, and of understanding low-density beetle populations.

The consequences of these natural processes on terrestrial ecology and nutrient cycling are well established, and their potential climatic effects resulting from modified land-atmosphere exchanges of carbon, energy, and water are increasingly being recognized. We developed a Marauding Insect Module (MIM) to quantify, in the Integrated BIosphere Simulator (IBIS), the consequences of insect activity on biogeochemical and biogeophysical fluxes, also accounting for the effects of altered vegetation dynamics. MIM can simulate damage from three different insect functional types: (1) defoliators on broadleaf deciduous trees, (2) defoliators on needleleaf evergreen trees, and (3) bark beetles on needleleaf evergreen trees, with the resulting impacts being estimated by IBIS based on the new, insect-modified state of the vegetation. MIM further accounts for the physical presence and gradual fall of insect-killed dead standing trees. The design of MIM should facilitate the addition of other insect types besides the ones already included and could guide the development of similar modules for other process-based vegetation models. After describing IBIS-MIM, we illustrate the usefulness of the model by presenting results spanning daily to centennial timescales for vegetation dynamics and cycling of carbon, energy, and water in a simplified setting and for bark beetles only. More precisely, we simulated 100% mortality events from the mountain pine beetle for three locations in western Canada. We then show that these simulated impacts agree with many previous studies based on field measurements, satellite data, or modelling.

In general, organisms can respond to changing environmental conditions by moving, by adapting in situ, or by going locally or globally extinct. Morphological changes, whether plastic or adaptive, are one way that species may respond in situ to local environmental change. Because cranial morphology is influenced by selective pressures arising from an organism's abiotic and biotic environments, including aspects of thermal physiology, diet, and sensory ecology, studies of cranial morphology may generate important insights into how species are responding to environmental change. To assess potential response of deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) to changing conditions in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California, we quantified cranial variation in museum specimens of this species collected approximately 100 years apart. Specifically, we examined how cranial morphology varies in three populations of this geographically widespread, ecological generalist over elevation and time. Our analyses indicate that cranial morphology does not differ with elevation within either modern or historical samples but does vary between time periods, suggesting that in situ responses to environmental change have occurred. Contrary to predictions based on Bergmann's rule, we found no consistent relationship between body size and either elevation or time, suggesting that morphological differences detected between historic and modern specimens are specific to factors influencing cranial structure. Collectively, these analyses demonstrate the potential importance of in situ changes in morphology as a response to changing environmental conditions.

This is true for the avifauna of western North America where our knowledge of high elevation use is primarily restricted to breeding assemblages. Here we report on systematic avian surveys of high elevation habitats over four years in British Columbia conducted during the post-breeding and fall migration periods (Aug-Oct). We detected a remarkable diversity of birds (95 species in 30 families) using alpine, subalpine, and montane forest, many of which used these habitats seasonally. One quarter of the species are on lists of conservation concern. Density, species richness, and community composition varied considerably between habitats and mountain ranges within the study area, especially between the western slope of the Coast range and other ranges. Most species exhibited strong temporal variation in patterns of abundance that were related to migratory behavior. From an extensive literature-based survey, we found that similar to 35% of North America's breeding bird species use high elevations, and that all primary high elevation habitats are important for full life-cyde conservation of this avifauna. Our findings highlight the importance of high elevation habitats to migrating birds from wide-ranging breeding distributions for at least three months of the year, a period equivalent to the length of the breeding season for most species. These results emphasize the need for effective conservation of fragile alpine and other high elevation habitats that are increasingly threatened by local, regional, and global anthropogenic disturbance.

Observational and modeling evidence suggest that warm temperatures observed during the late 20th century altered beetle population dynamics by accelerating beetle reproductive cycles leading to exponential population growth. The linkage between beetle outbreaks and climate warming has motivated efforts to reconstruct these disturbances using long-term environmental records using lake sediments. Here, we present data from across western North America in an effort to understand how beetle remains retrieved from lake sediments may be used as a proxy for reconstructing severe outbreaks and ecosystem response over centennial to millennial timescales. We (1) review existing literature related to beetle taphonomy; (2) present previously unpublished data of beetle remains in lake sediments; (3) comment on the development of a methodology to retrieve terrestrial beetle remains from lake sediments; (4) discuss potential controls on beetle carcass taphonomy into the sediment matrix; and lastly (5) speculate on the use of primary and secondary attack beetle remains as indicators of past outbreak episodes. Our synthesis suggests that the remains of primary attack beetles are rarely preserved in lake sediments, at least using small-diameter piston devices common in multi-proxy studies. Alternatively, remains of secondary attach beetles may be common but further work is required to understand how these insects can be used to aid in interpreting past forest disturbances, including bark beetle outbreaks and wildfire. A number of factors may influence whether or not bark beetle remains become entrained in the area of sediment focusing including lake water chemistry, fish predation and scavenging, and weather conditions during peak beetle emergence.

However, few if any studies have explicitly evaluated climatically enhanced beetle population dynamics in relation to climate-driven changes in forest composition and structure that may alter forest suitability for beetle infestation. We synthesized current understanding of the interactions among climate, spruce beetles (Dendroctonus rufipennis) and forest dynamics to parameterize and further advance the bark beetle module of a dynamic forest landscape model (LandClim) that also integrates fire and wind disturbance and climate-driven forest succession. We applied the model to a subalpine watershed in northwestern Colorado to examine the mechanisms and feedbacks that may lead to shifts in forest composition and spruce beetle disturbance under three climate change scenarios. Simulation results suggest increased drought-and beetle-induced reduction of large Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii) trees while Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) increased in dominance throughout the study area under all climate change scenarios. This shift in forest composition and structure counterbalances the enhancing effects of accelerated beetle population development and increased drought-induced susceptibility of spruce to beetles. As a result, we projected a long-term decrease in beetle-induced spruce mortality to below historical values under all climate scenarios at low elevations (<2800 m asl). Beetle-induced spruce mortality above 2800 m asl and under moderate climate change was slightly higher and more variable than under historical conditions but decreased to 36% and 6% of historical values under intermediate and extreme climate change, respectively. Because mechanisms driving beetle disturbance dynamics are similar across different bark beetle species, we argue that the depletion of host trees due to drought and beetle disturbance may also be important in other climate-sensitive beetle-host systems. We advocate for the consideration of climate-driven shifts in forest and disturbance dynamics in devising adaptive management strategies.",2015,10.1890/ES15-00394.1,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WOS:000367310600022,Paris,No,Yes,No,,CO,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Becky,No,,No,,

To understand the patterns and drivers of this vegetational change and the associated late-Holocene environmental dynamics, we analyzed radiocarbon-dated sediments from Grizzly Lake for chironomids, diatoms, pollen, macrofossils, charcoal, element composition, particle size, and magnetic properties for the period 4100-1800 cal BP. Chironamid assemblages assemblages reveal two episodes of decreased July temperature, at ca. 3300-3150 (ca -1 degrees C) and 2900-2550 cal BP (ca -2 degrees C). These episodes coincided with climate change elsewhere in the Northern Hemisphere, atmospheric reorganization, and low solar activity. Diatom-inferred lake levels dropped by ca. 5 m at 3200 cal BP, suggesting dry conditions during the period 3200-1800 cal BP. P. glauca declined and P. mariana expanded at ca. 3200 cal BP; this vegetational change was linked to diatom-inferred low lake levels and thus decreased moisture availability. Forest cover declined at 3300-3100, 2800-2500 and 2300-2100 cal BP and soil erosion as inferred from increased values of Al, K, Si, Ti, and Ca intensified, when solar irradiance was low. Plant taxa adapted to disturbance and cold climate (e.g. Alnus viridis, shrub Betula, Epilobium) expanded during these periods of reduced forest cover. This open vegetation type was associated with high fire activity that peaked at 2800 cal BP, when climatic conditions were particularly cold and dry. Forest recovery lagged behind subsequent climate warming (<+3 degrees C) by ca. 75 -225 years. Our multiproxy data set suggests that P. glauca was dominant under warm-moist climatic conditions, whereas P. mariana prevailed under cold-dry and warm-dry conditions. This pattern implies that climatic warming, as anticipated for this century, may promote P. glauca expansions, if moisture availability will be sufficiently high, while P. mariana may expand under dry conditions, possibly exacerbating climate impacts on the fire regime.

The RCM is the Hadley Centre Regional Climate Model, version 3, with improved physics parameterizations (HadRM3P) run at 25-km resolution and nested within the Hadley Centre Atmosphere Model, version 3 (HadAM3P). Overall, the means of seasonal temperature were well represented in the simulations; 95% of grid points were within 2.7 degrees, 2.4 degrees, and 3.6 degrees C of observations in winter, spring, and summer, respectively. The model was too warm over most of the domain in summer except central California and southern Nevada. HadRM3P produced more extreme temperatures than observed. The overall magnitude and spatial pattern of precipitation were well characterized, though HadRM3P exaggerated the orographic enhancement along the coastal mountains, Cascade Range, and Sierra Nevada.

The state of Colorado in the United States comprises a principal snow catchment area, with all major headwater river basins in Colorado providing substantial water flows to surrounding western and midwestern states. The ability to represent and quantify hydrologic processes controlling the generation and movement of water in headwater basins of Colorado therefore has significant implications for effective management of water resources in the western United States under varying climatic and land-use conditions. In the research reported in this paper, hydrologic modeling was applied to four snow-dominated, mountainous basins of Colorado [i.e.,the river basins of (1)Cache la Poudre, (2)Gunnison, (3)San Juan, and (4)Yampa] to evaluate the relevance of specific hydrologic components (i.e.,evapotranspiration, snow processes, groundwater processes, surface runoff, and so on) in the complex, high-elevation watersheds. The soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) model was calibrated and tested for multiple river locations within each basin using monthly naturalized flows over the 1990-2005 period. The model was able to adequately simulate streamflows at all locations within the four basins. Monthly patterns of precipitation, snowfall, evapotranspiration (ET), and total water yield were similar for all the basins, while subsurface lateral flow was the dominant hydrologic pathway, contributing between 64 and 82% to gross basin water yields on an average annual basis. Overall, results indicated the strong influence of snowmelt and groundwater processes on amounts and timing of streamflows in the study basins. Hence, enhanced representation of these processes may be essential to improve hydrological estimation using computer software in snowmelt-driven mountainous basins. In particular, examination of monthly streamflow residuals indicated that the normality and independence of model residuals, which are often assumed in parameter estimation and uncertainty analysis, were not always satisfied.",2015,10.1061/(ASCE)HE.1943-5584.0001130,Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,WOS:000361481300001,Paris,No,Yes,No,,CO,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Becky,No,,No,,

Statistical models are useful for making predictions about the occurrence of species based on variables derived from remote sensing or geographic information systems. We previously used 14 topographically based environmental variables from 49 locations in the Toquima Range (Nevada, U.S.A.) and species inventories conducted over 4 years (1996-1999) to model logistically the occurrence of resident butterfly species. To test the models, we collected new validation data in 39 locations in the nearby Shoshone Mountains in 2000-2001. We used a series of ""classification rules"" based on conventional logistic and Bayesian criteria to assess the success rates of predictions. The classification rules represented a gradient of stringency in the ""certainty"" with which predictions were made. More stringent rules reduced the number of predictions made but greatly increased the success rate of predictions. For comparisons of classification rules making similar numbers of predictions, conventional logistic and Bayesian criteria produced similar outcomes. Success rates for predicted absences were uniformly higher than for predicted presences. Increasing the temporal extent of data from 1 to 2 years elevated success rates for predicted presences but decreased success rates for predicted absences, leaving the overall success rates essentially the same. Although species occurrence rates (the proportion of locations in which each species was found) were correlated between the modeling and validation data sets, occurrence rates for many species increased or decreased substantially; erroneous predictions were more likely for those taxa. Model fit (measured by the explained deviance) was an indicator of the probable success rate of predicted presences but not of predicted absences or overall success rates. We suggest that classification rules for predicting likely presences and absences may be decoupled to improve overall predictive success.

We used Poisson regression to develop a predictive model of species richness of resident butterflies in the central Great Basin of western North America. Species inventory data and values for 14 environmental variables from 49 locations (canyon segments) in the Toquima Range (Nevada, USA) were used to build the model. We also included squares of the environmental variables to accommodate potential non-linear relationships. Species richness of butterflies was a significant function of elevation and local topographic heterogeneity, with the selected model explaining 57% of the total deviance of species richness. Predictive variables can be derived efficiently from GIS-based data for areas in which species inventories have not yet been conducted. Therefore, in addition to evaluating the ability of the model to explain observed variation in species richness, we generated and tested predictions of species richness for 'new' locations that had not been used to build the model. Predictions we're effective for five new segments also located in the Toquima Range, but not for 22 new segments in the nearby Shoshone Range.

A number of these recent shifts have been attributed to anthropogenic disturbances such as enhanced atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition or climate change. When these disturbances a e coupled, the response of alpine lakes becomes more complex and varies from region to region. The Beartooth Mountain Range, situated on the border between Montana and Wyoming, is part of the central Rocky Mountains; it is considered an area of relatively low N deposition but has experienced an increase in bulk precipitation rates, primarily in the form of snowfall, over the past century. We have examined a 400-yr sediment record from Beartooth Lake and have observed a rapid change in the diatom community structure over the past decade. A typical alpine lake diatom flora, consisting mainly of small Fragilaria sensu lato species, dominated this lake until approximately 1995, at which time Fragilaria crotonensis and Cyclotella bodanica var. lemanica rapidly increased to approximately 30% each of the total assemblage.

In California, the transport and deposition of pesticides from the agriculturally intensive Central Valley to the adjacent Sierra Nevada is well documented, and pesticides have been found in the bodies of Sierra frogs. Pesticides are therefore a plausible cause of declines, but to date no direct links have been found between pesticides and actual amphibian population declines. Using a geographic information system, we constructed maps of the spatial pattern of declines for eight declining California amphibian taxa, and compared the observed patterns of decline to those predicted by hypotheses of wind-borne pesticides, habitat destruction, ultraviolet radiation, and climate change. In four species, we found a strong positive association between declines and the amount of upwind agricultural land use, suggesting that wind-borne pesticides may be an important factor in declines. For two other species, declines were strongly associated with local urban and agricultural land use, consistent with the habitat-destruction hypothesis.

It is expected that doubling Of CO2 and increasing the amount of other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere would result in more severe weather, among other consequences. The purpose of the paper is to examine how flood frequencies and magnitudes in a midsize subalpine watershed on the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains in Alberta, Canada, would change under 2 X CO2 conditions. Given the poor spatial resolution of present general circulation models (GCM) and their uncertain performance at the regional scale, a first-order analysis is carried on, in which only rainfall intensity changes are considered to have the most significant impact on future floods. Estimates of storm rainfall increases are based on the literature survey, GCM projections for the study area, and transposition of southern climatic conditions. Two scenarios of likely most severe changes were selected: first, a 25% increase in the mean and standard deviation of Gumbel distribution of rainfall depth for storm durations from 6 to 48 h; second, a 50% increase in the standard deviation only. The HEC-1 watershed model and the soil conservation service runoff curve method for abstractions were used in Monte Carlo simulation. Comparison of Monte Carlo derived flood frequency curves for the two scenarios with the present day curve shows that scenario I is more critical in terms of flood flow increases than scenario 2. Under scenario 1, the mean annual flood on the study watershed would increase by almost 80% and the 100-year flood would increase by 41%. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Biogeochemical response of this tropical alpine system to climate change was inferred from changes in elemental concentrations and ratios and isotopic signatures in the upper 120 m of the lacustrine Funza core. Values of delta(13)C(org) exhibit eight abrupt, positive shifts that are thought to reflect rapid expansions of C-4 grasses in the tropical Andes and algal blooms. One of these excursions, interpreted to correspond to C-4 vegetation expansion, occurred in sediments accumulated during the last glaciation (similar to30,000-50,000 yr B.P.) and implies a downslope shift of the upper Andean treeline, regardless of prevailing temperatures. Sedimentary carbon/sulfur ratios are low and indicate significant sequestering of sulfur. Monosulfides are the dominant constituent of sedimentary sulfur during relatively humid intervals, when increased supply of iron caused by enhanced weathering favored the formation of monosulfide minerals under strongly reducing conditions. In contrast, organosulfur compounds dominate the sedimentary sulfur-species in relatively drier intervals when mildly reducing conditions and limited iron input promoted the diagenetic incorporation of sulfur in organic matter. Dry events inferred from the sulfur record typically correlate with glacial maxima, whereas glacial terminations are usually associated with wet periods.

This rain shadow effect often creates desert regions on the lee side of mountain belts in which precipitation is isotopically light. Changes in the isotopic composition of precipitation can be estimated from the isotopic composition of authigenic or pedogenic minerals, which can then be used to infer both the development of relief during orogenesis as well as the stability of a rain shadow formed by developing mountains. The delta(18)O of smectites formed from the weathering of Middle Miocene to Late Pliocene volcanic ashes currently exposed in the rain shadow of the modern Sierra Nevada of California show no indication of large-scale Late Cenozoic surface uplift of the Sierra and corresponding regional rain shadow development. Rather smectite isotope data tentatively suggest that elevations may have decreased over this time by as much as 2000 m toward the southern end of the range and 700 m in regions farther north. This suggests that the modern rain shadow cast over the western Basin and Range has been in existence since pre-Middle Miocene and that the Sierra Nevada have been a prominent orographic barrier since before this time. These interpretations are in accord with several recent studies also suggesting a possible Cenozoic elevation loss of an already developed Sierra Nevada mountain range.",2002,10.1029/2001TC001303,Geochemistry & Geophysics,WOS:000179018800003,Shana,No,Yes,No,,Sierra Nevada,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Becky,No,,No,,

We have collected a large data set of numeric ages from these terraces that is used to elucidate the geomorphic, fluvial, active tectonic, and climatic processes that operate at Holocene spatial and temporal scales. Detailed field mapping reveals three prominent Holocene straths and their overlying terrace deposits. Terrace ages fall into three broad ranges: ca. 9000-11000 yr B.P. (Qt4), 4000-8000 yr B.P. (Qt5), and 0-3000, yr B.P. (Qt6). Terrace deposit stratigraphy, sedimentology, and age distributions allow us to consider two alternative models for their genesis. The favored model states that the terrace ages are coincident with lateral incision of the Clearwater channel, emplacement of the terrace alluvium, and the carving of the straths. Vertical incision of the Clearwater channel was primarily relegated to the brief (similar to1000 yr) intervals when we have no record of terraces. Alternatively, the straths were carved as the channel incised vertically during the brief time periods between dated terrace deposits, and the terrace ages record a subsequent long time of alluviation atop the straths and concomitant termination of vertical incision. In both models, we envision a Clearwater River channel at or near capacity with a temporally variable rate of both lateral and vertical incision. Small deviations from this at-capacity condition are driven by variations in the liberation and delivery of hillslope sediment to the channel. We consider several causes for variable hillslope sediment flux in this tectonically active setting including Holocene climate change and ground accelerations related to earthquakes. Holocene rates of vertical incision are reconstructed along nearly the entire Clearwater Valley from the wide distribution of dated terraces. Incision rates clearly increase upstream, mimicking a pattern documented for Pleistocene terraces in the same basin; however, the rates are 2-3 times those determined for the Pleistocene terraces. The faster Holocene incision rates may be interpreted in terms of an increase in the rates of rock uplift. However, we favor an alternative explanation in which the Holocene rates represent a channel rapidly reacquiring its stable, graded concavity following protracted periods of time in the Pleistocene when it could not accomplish any vertical incision into tectonically uplifted bedrock because the channel was raised above the bedrock valley bottom by climatically induced alluviation. These results illustrate how, even in tectonically active settings, representative rates of rock uplift inferred from studies of river incision should be integrated over at least one glacial-interglacial cycle.",2002,10.1130/0016-7606(2002)114<0731:HSTCCA>2.0.CO;2,Geology,WOS:000176134500007,Shana,No,Yes,No,,Olympic mtns,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Becky,No,,No,,

Tie sediment fluxes of 16 major Alpine drainage basins were quant lied by determining the sediment volumes which have been trapped in valleys and lake basins. These became sedimentologically closed after the last glacier retreat around 17 000 cal. BP. The sediment volumes distributed over their provenance areas yield mean mechanical denudation rates between 250 to 1060 mm ka(-1). In contrast, modem denudation rates, derived from river loads and delta surveys, range from 30 to 360 mm ka(-1). Relief, such as rr-ean elevation and slope, turned out to be the primary control of both modem and Late Glacial mechanical denudation. Rock types seem to be responsible for some scatter of the data, but their role is masked by other factors. Modem denudation rates increase with higher proportions of bare rocks and glaciated area, but decrease with forest cover. An area-weighted extrapolation of the studied drainage basins to the entire Alps on the basis of major morphotectonic zones yields a mean denudation rate of 620 mm ka(-1) over the last 17 000 years. This rate clearly exceeds the modem rate of 125 mm ka(-1). Lake sediments and palaeoclimatic reconstructions confirm that the sediment yield of the Alps reached a maximum during deglaciation when large masses of unconsolidated materials were available, vegetation was scarse, and transport capacities were high. During the early Holocene sediment yield declined to a minimum before some climate deterioration and human activities again accelerated erosional processes. Assuming a denudation rate in the early Holocene half of the modem one, the Late Glacial denudation rates must have been in the order of 1100 to 2900 mm ka(-1). Consequently, denudation rates during a glacial/interglacial cycle probably varied by a factor of 14, which ties well within the range of other studies in central Europe, Scandinavia and North America. From large scale sediment budgets of perialpine sedimentary basins the overall denudation rate of the Alps during the Quaternary has been c. 400 mm ka(-1), i.e. about one third lower than the estimate for the last 17000 years. This can be well explained by the outstanding role which deglaciation played in the time span studied here.

In the ""remnant hypothesis"" parks are thought to be remnants of Vegetation that was widespread under previous climate conditions. The ""replacement hypothesis"" states that parks replace forest vegetation in response to disturbance, climate change, or a combination of these two factors.

Fossil pollen extracted from the sediments of live small ponds in and around Fish Creek Park was used to reconstruct Holocene vegetation changes. Changes in vegetation were reconstructed through the use of multivariate analyses and pollen ratios derived from modern surface samples and by comparison with pollen data from other studies. The pollen record indicates that shortly after deglaciation (similar to 11000 yr BP) the area supported alpine tundra, followed by whitebark pine-spruce-fir parkland at similar to 9500 yr BP. From similar to 8500 to 6000 yr BP, a pine parkland occupied the area, perhaps in response to climate conditions warmer than today.

Orographic effects combine with moisture-laden frontal systems originating in the Pacific Ocean to produce areas of very high precipitation on western slopes and dry basins of internal drainage on eastern hanks of the mountains. In the southern half of the region most of the runoff occurs during winter or spring, while in the northern part most occurs in summer, especially in glaciated basins, Analyses of long-term climatic and hydrological records, combined with palaeoclimatic reconstructions and simulations of future climates, are used as the basis for likely scenarios of climatic variations. The predicted hydrological response in northern California to a climate with doubled CO2 and higher temperatures is a decrease in the amount of precipitation falling as snow, and substantially increased runoff during winter and less in late spring and summer. One consequence of the predicted earlier runoff is higher salinity in summer and autumn in San Francisco Bay. In saline lakes, the incidence of meromixis and the associated reduction in nutrient supply and algal abundance is expected to vary significantly as runoff fluctuates. In subalpine lakes, global warming will probably will lead to increased productivity. Lacustrine productivity can also be altered by changes in wind regimes, drought-enhanced forest fires and maximal or minimal snowpacks associated with atmospheric anomalies such as Fl Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. Reduced stream temperature from increased contributions of glacial meltwater and decreased channel stability from changed runoff patterns and altered sediment loads has the potential to reduce the diversity of zoobenthic communities in predominately glacier-fed rivers. Climatic warming is likely to result in reduced growth and survival of sockeye salmon in freshwater, which would, in turn, increase marine mortality. Further research activities should include expanded studies at high elevations and of glacier mass balances and glacial runoff, applications of remote sensing to monitor changes, further refinement of regional climatic models to improve forecasts of future conditions and continued analyses of long-term physical, chemical and biological data to help understand responses to future climates.

These environments are representative of current climatic conditions and those predicted to accompany a doubling of atmospheric CO2, respectively, throughout the range of many western north American conifers. A previous study found that trees growing in the desert allocate proportionally more biomass to sapwood and less to leaf area than montane trees. We tested the hypothesis that respiration rates of sapwood are lower in desert trees than in montane trees due to reduced stem maintenance respiration (physiological acclimation) or reduced construction cost of stem tissue (structural acclimation). Maintenance respiration per unit sapwood Volume at 15 degrees C did not differ between populations (desert: 6.39 +/- 1.14 SE mu mol m(-3) s(-1), montane: 6.54 +/- 1.13 SE mu mol m(-3) s(-1), P = 0.71) and declined with increasing stem diameter (P = 0.001). The temperature coefficient of respiration (Q(10)) varied seasonally within both environments (P = 0.05). Construction cost of stem sapwood was the same in both environments (desert: 1.46 +/- 0.009 SE g glucose g(-1) sapwood, montane: 1.48 +/- 0.009 SE glucose g(-1) sapwood, P = 0.14). Annual construction respiration calculated from construction cost, percent carbon and relative growth rate was greater in montane populations due to higher growth rates. These data provide no evidence of respiratory acclimation by desert trees. Estimated yearly stem maintenance respiration was greater in large desert trees than in large montane trees because of higher temperatures in the desert and because of increased allocation of biomass to sapwood. By analogy, these data suggest that under predicted increases in temperature and aridity, potential increases in aboveground carbon gain due to enhanced photosynthetic rates may be partially offset by increases in maintenance respiration in large trees growing in CO2-enriched atmospheres.",1997,10.1007/s004420050203,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WOS:A1997XF86000003,Shana,No,,No,,Sierra Nevada,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Becky,No,,No,,

Variation in geologic substrate, landforms, and soils, in combination with steep environmental gradients, create habitat diversity across spatial scales from 10(6) ha to <10 m(2). This leads to higher biodiversity in a smaller space than in landscapes with less topographic variation. Mountains are often considered to be refuges for biological diversity at the regional scale, although variation in landscape features creates refuges at a fine scale as well. Mountains should also be considered a source of biological diversity, because they provide the germplasm for migration into lowland areas following glacial recession. Many taxa are distributed over a broad range of elevations andhabitats, which maximizes the potential to respond to environmental perturbations. Reorganization of species distribution and abundance as a result of climatic change may be impacted considerably by human-caused fragmentation of landscape features, especially at lower elevations.

Tree establishment was greatest during periods with above normal annual and summer temperatures, and normal or above normal precipitation.

Currently, there are numerous isotopic (lacustrine, palustrine, and pedogenic carbonates, hydrous silicates, fluid inclusions) and paleofloral (leaf physiognomy, stomata density) proxies that provide information on climatic and topographic histories of mountain belts. Compared to lacustrine and paleosoil carbonates that frequently provide detailed and temporally extensive paleoaltimetric records, the use of hydrous silicates (such as smectite, kaolinite, chert, as well as metamorphic minerals that grow in the presence of meteoric waters) in paleoclimate and paleoaltimetry studies has important additional advantages. First, hydrous silicates provide both a hydrogen and oxygen isotope record. These two isotope systems can be used to evaluate climate change, but are also useful in understanding evaporative effects on meteoric waters prior to mineral formation. Since evaporation can cause isotopic changes that otherwise would correspond to changes on the order of kilometers of surface uplift, it is critical in any isotopic paleoaltimetry study within continental interiors to examine both the hydrogen and oxygen isotope record. Second, hydrogen isotope ratios of micas in deep-seated extensional shear zones often reflect the composition of meteoric waters that infiltrated these rocks during the late stages of orogenesis. As such, it is possible to use the combined oxygen, hydrogen and geochronological record of synkinernatic micas in extensional shear zones as a paleoaltimeter. This information when combined with high-precision geochronology and paleoaltimetry studies of intermontane basins formed above these shear zones allows for the development of an integrated structural, sedimentologic, and surface elevation history of an evolving orogen.",2007,10.2138/rmg.2007.66.4,Geochemistry & Geophysics; Mineralogy,WOS:000251350400004,Meghan,No,No,No,,,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Becky,No,Yes,Paleo,,

The inferred median fire return interval (FRI) was 800-1200 cal. yr, depending on the extent of inbuilt age errors resulting from charring of wood pre-dating actual fire ages. This FRI is likely an overestimate, as less severe events may not have created sufficient erosion and slope instability to preserve a record of charcoal in buried soils and slope deposits. Median time since fire was 467 cal. yr based on ages of the uppermost charcoal found at each site, but the severity of heart-rots in the dominant redcedars (Thuja plicata Donn ex D.

A comparison of this mid-European lake-level record with the Outbursts from proglacial Lake Agassiz in North America suggests that, between 13,000 and 8000 cal yr B.P., phases of positive water balance were the response in west-central Europe to climate cooling episodes, which were induced by perturbation of the thermohaline circulation due to sudden freshwater releases to oceans. This probably was in response to a Southward migration of the Atlantic Westerly Jet and its associated cyclonic track.

National parks in Canada's Rocky and Purcell Mountains offer a rare opportunity to evaluate the impacts of a century of conservation on forest carbon (C) stocks and fluxes. We studied forest ecosystem C dynamics of three national parks in the Rocky and Purcell Mountains of British Columbia - Yoho, Kootenay, and Glacier National Parks - over the period 1970-2008 using the CBM-CFS3 inventory-based forest C budget model. We hypothesized that parks and protected areas would contain higher forest C density and have lower CO2 uptake rates compared to their surrounding reference areas because of the exclusion of timber harvesting and resulting predominance of older, slower growing forest stands. Results for Glacier National Park relative to its reference area were consistent with our hypothesis. Forests in Kootenay National Park were substantially younger than those in its reference area despite the exclusion of harvesting because natural disturbances affected large areas within the park over the past century. Site productivity in Kootenay National Park was also generally higher in the park than in its reference area. Consequently, Kootenay National Park had both higher C density and higher CO2 uptake than its reference area. Yoho National Park forests were similar in age to reference area forests and more productive, and therefore had both higher C stocks and greater CO2 uptake. C density was higher in all 3 parks compared to their surrounding areas, and parks with younger forests than reference areas had higher CO2 uptake. The results of this study indicate that forest conservation in protected areas such as national parks can preserve existing C stocks where natural disturbances are rare. Where natural disturbances are an important part of the forest ecology, conservation may or may not contribute to climate change mitigation because of the risk of C loss in the event of wildfire or insect-caused tree mortality. Anticipated increases in natural disturbance resulting from global warming may further reduce the climate change mitigation potential of forest conservation in disturbance-prone ecosystems. We show that managing for the ecological integrity of landscapes can also have carbon mitigation co-benefits. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Radiocarbon dating of alluvial charcoal reconstructed local fire occurrence and geomorphic response, and fossil woodrat (Neotoma) middens revealed pinyon and juniper arrivals. Fire peaks occurred similar to 10,700-9500, 7200-6700, 2400-2000, 850-700, and 550-400 cal yr BP, whereas similar to 9500-7200, 6700-4700 and similar to 1500-1000 cal yr BP are fire-free. Wetter climates and denser vegetation fueled episodic fires and debris flows during the early and late Holocene, whereas drier climates and reduced vegetation caused frequent sheetflooding during the mid-Holocene. Increased fires during the wetter and more variable late Holocene suggest variable climate and adequate fuels augment fires at CIRO. Utah juniper and single-leaf pinyon colonized CIRO by 3800 and 2800 cal yr BP, respectively, though pinyon did not expand broadly until similar to 700 cal yr BP. Increased fire-related deposition coincided with regional droughts and pinyon infilling similar to 850-700 and 550-400 cal yr BP. Early and late Holocene vegetation change probably played a major role in accelerated fire activity, which may be sustained into the future due to pinyon-juniper densification and cheatgrass invasion.

In north-central Alberta, lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud. var. latifolia) and jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb) form a complex and poorly defined hybrid zone. Better knowledge of this zone is relevant, given the recent host expansion of mountain pine beetle into jack pine. We characterized the zone by genotyping 1998 lodgepole, jack pine, and hybrids from British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Ontario, and Minnesota at 11 microsatellites. Using Bayesian algorithms, we calculated genetic ancestry and used this to model the relationship between species occurrence and environment. In addition, we analyzed the ancestry of hybrids to calculate the genetic contribution of lodgepole and jack pine. Finally, we measured the amount of gene flow between the pure species. We found the distribution of the pine classes is explained by environmental variables, and these distributions differ from classic distribution maps. Hybrid ancestry was biased toward lodgepole pine; however, gene flow between the two species was equal. The results of this study suggest that the hybrid zone is complex and influenced by environmental constraints.

In all modified subbasins, ""spring runoff"" metrics occurred much earlier than natural flow (up to similar to 44 days earlier for April-July flows). Storage capacity modulated the magnitude of timing of flow-metric changes, with the largest storage capacity leading to the most change. However, even in subbasins with low storage capacity, we found significant change in most timing of flow metrics. We also found that damming, especially in subbasins with higher storage capacity, overwhelmed climate variability in all basins for most flow metrics.

We measured POPs in eggs and plasma of an apex predator, the osprey (Pandion haliaetus) breeding in IS mountainous watersheds across a broad latitudinal, longitudinal and altitudinal range in western Canada. After accounting for proximate biotic factors such as trophic level (delta N-15) and carbon source (delta C-13), variability in contaminant concentrations, including Sigma DDT (sum of trichlorodiphenylethane-related compounds), toxaphene, hexachlorobenzene (HCB), total chlordane, and Sigma PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) in osprey tissues was explained by interactions among relative size of watersheds, water bodies, elevation, and glacial input. Sigma DDT in nestling plasma, for example, decreased with lake elevation, probably as a result of local past inputs from agricultural or public health usage at lower altitude sites. In contrast, toxaphene, never used as an insecticide in western Canada, increased with elevation and year-round snow and ice cover in both plasma and eggs, indicating long-range atmospheric sources as dominant for toxaphene. Lower chlorinated PCBs in plasma tended to decrease with elevation and ice cover consistent with published data and model outcomes. Temporal trends of POPs in osprey eggs are coincident with some modeled predictions of release from melting glaciers due to climate change.

The goal of our research is to employ a robust clustering algorithm to provide a transparent method of integrating remotely sensed datasets into homogeneous ecosystem units for conservation planning and monitoring ecosystem condition and change. Using a suite of ecosystem characteristics derived from digital elevation and remotely sensed data at 1 km spatial resolution, we classify the 94 million ha within the province of British Columbia (BC), Canada, into 16 terrestrial ecosystem regions (and a water category) using a two-step clustering approach. Initially, 10 metrics representing the physical environment (elevation and soil wetness potential), available energy (solar insolation and snow melt) and vegetation production (fraction of photosynthetically active radiation) were considered for ecosystem classification, which were reduced to six after analyzing variable inter-correlations. The results provide ecologically unique terrestrial regions: ten of which describe the Northern Boreal, Coastal Mountains and Southern Interior Mountains, and six the coastal lowlands, Georgia Depression, interior, Boreal Plains and Taiga Plains. Analyzing the spatial interaction between the cluster categories revealed that highly dispersed ecosystem types occur most often in the intermediate elevation zone, moderate dispersion at the highest elevations, and homogeneity in the lowland areas where elevation remains relatively constant. When overlaid with BC's standard biogeoclimatic ecosystem classification zones the newly developed regions represent similar ecosystem ranges in the coastal, Taiga and Boreal Plains. However, overall our delineation exhibits a greater level of diversity in the alpine environment, and greater homogeneity in the central and southern interior. The quantitative regionalization approach we present offers a broad-scale assessment of British Columbia's ecosystem diversity that can be used as a supplement to traditional in situ biodiversity assessments to provide detail in under-sampled regions of BC or areas experiencing landscape change.

Large regions in western North America have become more favorable to the MPB, which has extended its range into higher elevations and more northerly latitudes, previously considered climatically unsuitable. Various investigators, and recent forest health surveys in Alberta have suggested that the beetle's range could shift further east on both lodgepole (Pinus contorta Dougl.) and jack pine (Pious banksiana Lamb.) into the boreal forest. A risk assessment of the threat of MPB to Canada's boreal forest identified effective monitoring and detection in areas vulnerable to infestation as the most critical information need. Changing climate may also be independently impacting pine forests, for instance through moisture stress. Species' vulnerability to climate change is reflected in modeled increases or decreases in the probability of its presence across its range. We hypothesize that areas within the current ranges of lodgepole and jack pine that have historically been sub-optimal for beetle expansion may become increasingly vulnerable as a result of climate change. In our analysis, we first test the ability of physiologically-based models to predict the recorded distributions of lodgepole and jack pine for 12,456 ground plots across British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan, using monthly climatic data derived for a calibration period between 1950 and 1975. Both the presence and absence of the two tree species recorded on survey plots were predicted, on average, with an accuracy of 85% for the calibration period. We then identified locations that appear to have become less suitable for these pine species in each subsequent year between 1976 and 2006 and found that the suitable range area for lodgepole and jack pine for > 50% of years in the period decreased by 45% and 40%, respectively. These results were compared with outputs from a climate-suitability model that identified areas of potential range expansion by MPB for two periods: 2001-2030 and 2010-2040. The area of vulnerable lodgepole pine forests that coincided with the area of potential beetle expansion was 40,000 km(2) in 2001-2030 and 45,000 km(2) in 2010-2040. The area of vulnerable jack pine was much less, ranging from 4000 to 8000 km(2) for the two periods. This analysis is unique in that it acknowledges the complexity of the beetle-host interaction by incorporating the potential impact of climate change on each of these elements into predictions of future host susceptibility to infestation. Such information is vital for assessing the ongoing risk of MPB range expansion and for designing future monitoring programs. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The hydrologic model has been applied to many river basins at scales from 0.0625 degrees to 1.0 degrees. The water temperature model, which uses a semi-Lagrangian numerical scheme to solve the one-dimensional, time-dependent equations for thermal energy balance in advective river systems, has been applied and tested on segmented river systems in the Pacific Northwest. The state-space structure of the water temperature model described in previous work is extended to include propagation of uncertainty. Model results focus on proof of concept by comparing statistics from a study of a test basin with results from other studies that have used either process models or statistical models to estimate water temperature. The results from this study compared favorably with those of selected case studies using data-driven statistical models.

A large number of migratory bird species appear to be declining as the result of climate change, but whether resident bird species have or will be adversely affected by climate change is less clear. We focus on the South Hills crossbill (Loxia curvirostra complex), which is endemic to about 70 km(2) of Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta latifolia) forest in southern Idaho, USA. 2. Our results indicate that the South Hills crossbill has declined by over 60% between 2003 and 2008, and that decreasing adult survival drives this population decline. 3. We evaluated the relative support for multiple hypotheses linking crossbill survival to climate, an ectoparasitic mite (scaly-leg mites Knemidokoptes jamaicensis), and the recent emergence of West Nile virus. Changes in adult apparent survival rate were closely associated with average spring and annual temperatures, and with high temperatures (>= 32 degrees C) during summer, which have increased during the last decade. In contrast, there was little evidence that scaly-leg mites or West Nile virus contributed to recent declines in adult survival. 4. The most probable mechanism causing the decline in adult survival and population size is a decrease in the availability of their primary food resource, seeds in serotinous pine cones. Cone production has declined with increasing annual temperatures, and these cones appear to be prematurely opening owing to increasingly hot summer conditions releasing their seeds and reducing the carrying capacity for crossbills later in the year. 5. In light of regional climate change forecasts, which include an increase in both annual temperature and hot days (>32 degrees C), and the likely disappearance of lodgepole pine from southern Idaho by the end of this century, additional research is needed to determine how to maintain lodgepole pine forests and their supply of seeds to conserve one of the few bird species endemic to the continental United States.",2012,10.1111/j.1365-2656.2011.01918.x,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Zoology,WOS:000300502600006,Becky,Yes,Yes,Yes,plot/family/group," South Hills crossbill (Loxia curvirostra complex) (my geog scale may be off, not sure if it would be landscape or plot/species group)",NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Becky,Yes,Yes,Yes,South Hills and Albion Mountains,

The mountain pine beetle Dendroctonus ponderosae (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), is a landscape-altering insect that infests forests of North America. Abundant availability of host trees due to altered disturbance regimes has facilitated an unprecedented, landscape-wide outbreak of this pest in British Columbia and Alberta, Canada, during the past decade. A previous outbreak in the 1980s, in central British Columbia, collapsed due to host depletion and extreme cold weather events. Despite the importance of such extreme weather events and other temperature-related signals in modulating an outbreak, few landscape-level models have studied the associations of extreme cold events with outbreak occurrences. We studied the individual associations of several biologically-relevant cold temperature variables, and other temperature/degree-day terms, with outbreak occurrences in a spatial-temporal logistic regression model using data from the current outbreak. Timing, frequency, and duration of cold snaps had a severe negative association with occurrence of an outbreak in a given area. Large drops in temperature (>10 degrees C) or extreme winter minimum temperatures reduced the outbreak probability. We then used the model to apply eight different climate change scenarios to the peak year of the current outbreak. Our scenarios involved combinations of increasing annual temperature and different variances about this trend. Our goal was to examine how spatial outbreak pattern would have changed in the face of changing thermal regime if the underlying outbreak behaviour remained consistent. We demonstrate that increases in mean temperature by 1 degrees C to 4 degrees C profoundly increased the risk of outbreaks with effects first being manifested at higher elevations and then at increasing latitudes.

Forests have already responded to these changes, and the future temperature and precipitation scenarios are of foremost concern, especially in the mountainous western United States, where forests occur in the dry environments that interface with grasslands. The objective of this study was to understand the trade-offs between temperature and water controls on these forested sites in the context of available climate projections. Three temperature and precipitation scenarios from IPCC AR4 AOGCMs ranging in precipitation levels were input to the process model Biome-BGC for key forested sites in the northern U. S. Rocky Mountains. Despite the omission of natural and human-caused disturbances in our simulations, our results show consequential effects from these conservative future temperature and precipitation scenarios. According to these projections, if future precipitation and temperatures are similar to or drier than the dry scenario depicted here, high-elevation forests on both the drier and wetter sites, which have in the absence of disturbance accumulated carbon, will reduce their carbon accumulation. Under the marginally drier climate projections, most forests became carbon sources by the end of the simulation horizon (2089). Under all three scenarios, growing season lengthened, the number of days with snow on the ground decreased, peak snow occurred earlier, and water stress increased through the projection horizon (1950-2089) for all sites, which represent the temperature and precipitation spectrum of forests in this region.

While climate change is widely expected to produce significant changes in hydrology and stream temperature, the effects of climate change on sediment yield have received less attention. In the northern Rocky Mountains, we expect climate change to increase sediment yield primarily through changes in temperature and hydrology that promote vegetation disturbances (i.e., wildfire, insect/pathogen outbreak, drought-related die off). Here, we synthesize existing data from central Idaho to explore (1) how sediment yields are likely to respond to climate change in semi-arid basins influenced by wildfire, (2) the potential consequences for aquatic habitat and water resource infrastructure, and (3) prospects for mitigating sediment yields in forest basins. Recent climate-driven increases in the severity and extent of wildfire suggest that basin-scale sediment yields within the next few years to decades could be greater than the long-term average rate of 146 T km(-2) year(-1) observed for central Idaho. These elevated sediment yields will likely impact downstream reservoirs, which were designed under conditions of historically lower sediment yield. Episodic erosional events (massive debris flows) that dominate post-fire sediment yields are impractical to mitigate, leaving road restoration as the most viable management opportunity for offsetting climate-related increases in sediment yield. However, short-term sediment yields from experimental basins with roads are three orders of magnitude smaller than those from individual fire-related events (on the order of 10(1) T km(-2) year(-1) compared to 10(4)T km(-2)year(-1), respectively, for similar contributing areas), suggesting that road restoration would provide a relatively minor reduction in sediment loads at the basin-scale. Nevertheless, the ecologically damaging effects of fine sediment (material <6 mm) chronically produced from roads will require continued management efforts.

We illustrate how spatial differences in groundwater dynamics can also play a significant role in determining streamflow responses to warming. We examine two contrasting watersheds, one located in the Western Cascades and the other in the High Cascades mountains of Oregon. We use both empirical analysis of streamflow data and physically based, spatially distributed modeling to disentangle the relative importance of multiple and interacting controls. In particular, we explore the extent to which differences in snow accumulation and melt and drainage characteristics (deep ground water vs. shallow subsurface) mediate the effect of climate change. Results show that within the Cascade Range, local variations in bedrock geology and concomitant differences in volume and seasonal fluxes of subsurface water will likely result in significant spatial variability in responses to climate forcing.

To understand the impacts of these stressors, it is crucial to develop assessments of forest properties to establish baselines, determine the extent of changes, and provide information to ecosystem modeling activities. Here we report on spatial patterns of characteristics of forest ecosystems in the western United States, including area, stand age, forest type, and carbon stocks, and comparisons of these patterns with those from satellite imagery and simulation models. The USDA Forest Service collected ground-based measurements of tree and plot information in recent decades as part of nationwide forest inventories. Using these measurements together with a methodology for estimating carbon stocks for each tree measured, we mapped county-level patterns across the western United States. Because forest ecosystem properties are often significantly different between hardwood and softwood species, we describe patterns of each. The stand age distribution peaked at 60 100 years across the region, with hardwoods typically younger than softwoods. Forest carbon density was highest along the coast region of northern California, Oregon, and Washington and lowest in the arid regions of the Southwest and along the edge of the Great Plains. These results quantify the spatial variability of forest characteristics important for understanding large-scale ecosystem processes and their controlling mechanisms. To illustrate other uses of the inventory-derived forest characteristics, we compared them against examples of independently derived estimates. Forest cover compared well with satellite-derived values when only productive stands were included in the inventory estimates. Forest types derived from satellite observations were similar to our inventory results, though the inventory database suggested more heterogeneity.

On average, Engelmann spruce populations were polymorphic at 80% of 24 isozyme loci, with 2.4 alleles per locus and expected heterozygosity of 0.255. The respective means for four populations of blue spruce were 42.7%, 1.6 alleles, and 0.138. Of total diversity, 14.7% was among populations in Engelmann spruce and 8.6% in blue spruce. In Engelmann spruce, numbers of alleles increased from south to north. Recent bottlenecks were indicated in the three southernmost populations of Engelmann spruce and in the northernmost population of blue spruce. Cluster analysis divided Engelmann spruce into a northern group and a Southwestern group; however, populations from Utah were distributed among both clusters. Genetic distance was correlated with geographic distance between northern populations but not between Southwestern populations, where drift predominated over gene flow. In two Engelmann spruce populations from Utah, multilocus outcrossing rates were 0.951 (+/- 0.016) and 0.940 (+/- 0.071). At Flys Peak, Arizona, the southernmost location of Engelmann spruce, outcrossing was also high, 0.899 (+/- 0.017).

The downscaling method makes minimal, physically based corrections to the global simulation while preserving much of the statistics of interannual variability in the climate model. Differences among the downscaled results for simulations of present-day climate form a basis for model evaluation. The downscaled results are used to simulate streamflow in the Yakima River, a mountainous basin in Washington, USA, to illustrate how model differences affect streamflow simulations. The downscaling is applied to the output of three models (ECHAM4, HADCM3, and NCAR-PCM) for simulations of historic conditions (1900-2000) and two future emissions scenarios (A2 and B2 for 2000-2100) from the IPCC assessment. The ECHAM4 simulation closely reproduces the observed statistics of temperature and precipitation for the 42 year period 1949-90. Streamflow computed from this climate simulation likewise produces similar statistics to streamflow computed from the observed data. Downscaled climate-change scenarios from these models are examined in light of the differences in the present-day simulations.

S., global climate simulations were produced using the National Center for Atmospheric Research/Department of Energy (NCAR/DOE) Parallel Climate Model (PCM). The Penn State/NCAR Mesoscale Model (MM5) was used to downscale the PCM control ( 20 years) and three future ( 2040 - 2060) climate simulations to yield ensemble regional climate simulations at 40 km spatial resolution for the western U. S. This paper describes the regional simulations and focuses on the hydroclimate conditions in the Columbia River Basin (CRB) and Sacramento- San Joaquin River (SSJ) Basin. Results based on global and regional simulations show that by mid-century, the average regional warming of 1 to 2.5 degreesC strongly affects snowpack in the western U. S. Along coastal mountains, reduction in annual snowpack was about 70% as indicated by the regional simulations. Besides changes in mean temperature, precipitation, and snowpack, cold season extreme daily precipitation increased by 5 to 15 mm/day (15 - 20%) along the Cascades and the Sierra. The warming resulted in increased rainfall at the expense of reduced snowfall, and reduced snow accumulation ( or earlier snowmelt) during the cold season. In the CRB, these changes were accompanied by more frequent rain-on-snow events. Overall, they induced higher likelihood of wintertime flooding and reduced runoff and soil moisture in the summer. Changes in surface water and energy budgets in the CRB and SSJ basin were affected mainly by changes in surface temperature, which were statistically significant at the 0.95 confidence level. Changes in precipitation, while spatially incoherent, were not statistically significant except for the drying trend during summer. Because snow and runoff are highly sensitive to spatial distributions of temperature and precipitation, this study shows that ( 1) downscaling provides more realistic estimates of hydrologic impacts in mountainous regions such as the western U. S., and ( 2) despite relatively small changes in temperature and precipitation, changes in snowpack and runoff can be much larger on monthly to seasonal time scales because the effects of temperature and precipitation are integrated over time and space through various surface hydrological and land-atmosphere feedback processes.

The assessment employed observations of sensitivity and response to climatic variability, downscaled climate projections, literature reviews, current management policies and practices, expert knowledge, and stakeholder engagement. Primary pathways for climate impacts focused on projected increases in extreme high flows and flooding, elevated winter soil moisture and landslide hazards, and loss of snowpack. The biggest impacts to roads and trails are expected from temperature-induced changes in hydrologic regimes that enhance autumn flooding and reduce spring snowpack. Projected higher winter soil moisture caused by changes in seasonal precipitation and snow accumulation could reduce slope stability. Earlier snowmelt may lengthen the snow-free season for visitor use and agency operations. Infrastructure age, design, maintenance, location, use, and limited redundancy along with funding policies and management, influence the sensitivities of the transportation system. Vulnerabilities were identified based on when and where these sensitivities to changes in climate may emerge. Adaptation strategies and tactics identified to address these vulnerabilities included: upgrading stream crossing and drainage design, changing use and maintenance, relocating or closing roads and trails, modifying funding policies, and expanding pubic engagement.

Presently, the assessment of potential elevation-dependent responses is difficult because many gauged watersheds integrate drainage areas that are both snow and rain dominated. To predict the impact of snowline rise on streamflow, we mapped the current snowline (1980m) for the Salmon River watershed (Idaho, USA) and projected its elevation after 3 degrees C warming (2440m). This increase results in a 40% reduction in snow-covered area during winter months. We expand this analysis by collecting streamflow records from a new, elevation-stratified gauging network of watersheds contained within high (2250-3800m), mid (1500-2250m) and low (300-1500m) elevations that isolate snow, mixed and rain-dominated precipitation regimes. Results indicate that lags between percentiles of precipitation and streamflow are much shorter in low elevations than in mid- and high-elevation watersheds. Low elevation annual percentiles (Q(25) and Q(75)) of streamflow occur 30-50days earlier than in higher elevation watersheds. Extreme events in low elevations are dominated by low- and no-flow events whereas mid- and high-elevation extreme events are primarily large magnitude floods. Only mid- and high-elevation watersheds are strongly cross correlated with catchment-wide flow of the Salmon River, suggesting that changes in contributions from low-elevation catchments may be poorly represented using mainstem gauges. As snowline rises, mid-elevation watersheds will likely exhibit behaviours currently observed only at lower elevations. Streamflow monitoring networks designed for operational decision making or change detection may require modification to capture elevation-dependent responses of streamflow to warming.

Interactions between nonnative species may alter their impacts on native species, yet few studies have addressed multispecies interactions. The spread of whirling disease, caused by the nonnative parasite Myxobolus cerebralis, has generated declines in wild trout populations across western North America. Westslope Cutthroat Trout Oncorhynchus clarkii lewisi in the northern Rocky Mountains are threatened by hybridization with introduced Rainbow Trout O. mykiss. Rainbow Trout are more susceptible to whirling disease than Cutthroat Trout and may be more vulnerable due to differences in spawning location. We hypothesized that the presence of whirling disease in a stream would (1) reduce levels of introgressive hybridization at the site scale and (2) limit the size of the hybrid zone at the whole-stream scale. We measured levels of introgression and the spatial extent of hybridization between Rainbow Trout and Westslope Cutthroat Trout in four disease-positive streams and six disease-negative streams within the Blackfoot River basin of Montana. In addition to disease status, we considered habitat quality, stream slope, distance from the confluence, temperature, and elevation. Whirling disease presence was not associated with either the level of introgression at a site or the size of the hybrid zone. Temperature, elevation, and stream slope were all influential in determining levels of introgression at the site scale. Stream slope was the most influential factor determining the size of the hybrid zone, as longer, steeper streams contained smaller hybrid zones. Stream slope is a driver of many habitat characteristics that may provide refuge from invasive species in the coming decades. Although the multispecies interactions examined in this study did not alter the impacts of invasion on native species, community assemblages will continue to change with the spread of nonnative species, requiring continued assessment to determine their impacts on native species.",2015,10.1080/02755947.2015.1007182,Fisheries,WOS:000354576000017,Micah,Yes,Yes,Yes,,"Blackfoot River, MT",NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Becky,Yes,Yes,Yes,Blackfoot River basin of Montana,

This is particularly important for improving the simulation accuracy of models used to evaluate potential hydrologic responses to land use and climate change. The distributed hydrology soil-vegetation model (DHSVM) was parameterized for the Mica Creek Experimental Watershed in northern Idaho. Performance was assessed based on measured streamflow from nested and paired watersheds, snowpack dynamics, soil moisture, and transpiration estimated from sap flux. In general, DHSVM effectively simulated snowpack dynamics, soil water content, and the streamflow regime. Streamflow simulation for seven subcatchments had model efficiencies ranging between 0.63 and 0.79. Model efficiency of snowpack simulation at a SNOTEL site was 0.95. Some minor discrepancies between simulated and measured values suggested that some processes, such as snow redistribution, were not represented by the model or were insufficiently parameterized for local conditions. A sensitivity analysis indicated that soil porosity, leaf area index, and minimum stomatal resistance were among the most influential parameters that affected variations in the simulated hydrological regime. However, those variables can be reasonably estimated based on field or remote sensing data. Other important parameters, such as saturated hydraulic conductivity, are more difficult to quantify and therefore need to be refined during the calibration phase. A description of the iterative parameter refinement process that was used in the calibration phase of the model is included to assist other researchers in refining model parameterizations.

Although mechanistic models are commonly applied for evaluation of climate effects for snowmelt, empirical relationships provide a first-order validation of the various postulates required for their implementation. Previous studies of empirical sensitivity for April 1 snow water equivalent (SWE) in the western United States were developed by regressing interannual variations in SWE to winter precipitation and temperature. This offers a temporal analog for climate change, positing that a warmer future looks like warmer years. Spatial analogs are used to hypothesize that a warmer future may look like warmer places, and are frequently applied alternatives for complex processes, or states/metrics that show little interannual variability (e.g., forest cover). We contrast spatial and temporal analogs for sensitivity of April 1 SWE and the mean residence time of snow (SRT) using data from 524 Snowpack Telemetry (SNOTEL) stations across the western U.S. We built relatively strong models using spatial analogs to relate temperature and precipitation climatology to snowpack climatology (April 1 SWE, R-2=0.87, and SRT, R-2=0.81). Although the poorest temporal analog relationships were in areas showing the highest sensitivity to warming, spatial analog models showed consistent performance throughout the range of temperature and precipitation. Generally, slopes from the spatial relationships showed greater thermal sensitivity than the temporal analogs, and high elevation stations showed greater vulnerability using a spatial analog than shown in previous modeling and sensitivity studies. The spatial analog models provide a simple perspective to evaluate potential futures and may be useful in further evaluation of snowpack with warming.",2014,10.1002/2013WR014844,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Water Resources,WOS:000347921100020,Micah,Yes,Yes,Yes,Landscape/State-Province,Western US,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Becky,Yes,Yes,Yes,Western US,

Two separate validation approaches indicate this dataset provides a more accurate representation of glacial ice and perennial snow cover for the region than either the U.S. glacier database derived from US Geological Survey (USGS) Digital Raster Graphics (DRG) maps (based on aerial photography primarily from the 1960s-1980s) or the National Land Cover Database 2011 perennial ice and snow cover class. Our 2010-2014 Landsat-derived dataset indicates 28% less glacier and perennial snow cover than the USGS DRG dataset. There are larger differences between the datasets in some regions, such as the Rocky Mountains of Northwest Wyoming and Southwest Montana, where the Landsat dataset indicates 54% less PISC area. Analysis of Landsat scenes from 1987-1988 and 2008-2010 for three regions using a more conventional, semi-automated approach indicates substantial decreases in glaciers and perennial snow cover that correlate with differences between PISC mapped by the USGS DRG dataset and the automated Landsat-derived dataset. This suggests that most of the differences in PISC between the USGS DRG and the Landsat-derived dataset can be attributed to decreases in PISC, as opposed to differences between mapping techniques. While the dataset produced by the automated Landsat mapping approach is not designed to serve as a conventional glacier inventory that provides glacier outlines and attribute information, it allows for an updated estimate of PISC for the conterminous U.S. as well as for smaller regions. Additionally, the new dataset highlights areas where decreases in PISC have been most significant over the past 25-50 years.

We monitored stream temperatures between August 2008 and August 2009 at 41 sites ranging from small headwater streams to larger valley bottom streams. At a subset of these sites (n = 27), we collected tailed frog abundance and biomass estimates.

Larval occurrence was found to be limited when DD 5 was = 160 degrees C and MWAT = 8 degrees C. No breeding streams were too warm to support tailed frogs. Frogs and tadpoles had similar realized niche centres for both MWAT (about 10.8 degrees C) and DD 5 (about 355 degrees C). However, frogs had greater realized niche widths than tadpoles.

In western North America, recent widespread insect outbreaks and wildfires have sparked acute concerns about potential insect-fire interactions. Although previous research shows that insect activity typically does not increase wildfire likelihood, key uncertainties remain regarding insect effects on wildfire severity (i.e., ecological impact). Recent assessments indicate that outbreak severity and burn severity are not strongly associated, but these studies have been limited to specific insect or fire events. Here, we present a regional census of large wildfire severity following outbreaks of two prevalent bark beetle and defoliator species, mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) and western spruce budworm (Choristoneura freemani), across the US Pacific Northwest. Wefirst quantify insect effects on burn severity with spatial modeling at the fire event scale and then evaluate how these effects vary across the full population of insect-fire events (n = 81 spanning 1987-2011). In contrast to common assumptions of positive feedbacks, we find that insects generally reduce the severity of subsequent wildfires.

The climatic changes expected during the next decades - large increases in mean temperature, increased heat waves, and significant long-term regional drying in the western USA - will likely increase chronic forest stress and mortality. The aim of this research is to develop and apply a new forest vulnerability index (FVI) associated with drought and high temperatures across the Pacific Northwest region (PNW; Oregon and Washington) of the USA during the MODIS Aqua era (since 2003). Our technique incorporates the alterations to canopy water and energy exchange processes caused by drought and high temperatures with spatially continuous MODIS land surface temperature (LST) and evapotranspiration (ET), and with Parameter-elevation Relationships on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) precipitation (P) data. With P and ET, we calculate a monthly water balance variable for each individual pixel normalized by forest type group (FTG), and then difference the water balance with the corresponding normalized monthly meanLST to calculate a monthly forest stress index (FSI). We then extract the pixel-specific (800-m resolution) statistically significant temporal trends of the FSI from 2003 to 2012 by month (April to October). The FVI is the slope of the monthly FSI across years, such that there is a FVI for each month. Statistically significant positive slopes indicate interannual increases in stress leading to expected forest vulnerability (positive FVI) for a given month. Positive FVI values were concentrated in the months of August and September, with peak vulnerability occurring at different times for different FTGs. Overall, increased vulnerability rates were the highest in drier FTGs such as Ponderosa Pine, Juniper, and Lodgepole Pine. Western Larch and Fir/Spruce/Mountain Hemlock groups occupy moister sites but also had relatively high proportion of positive FVI values. The Douglas-fir group had the second largest total area of increased vulnerability due to its large areal extent in the study area. Based on an analysis using imagery viewed in Google Earth, we confirm that areas with increased vulnerability are associated with greater amounts of stress and mortality. The FVI is a new way to conceptualize and monitor forest vulnerability based on first-order principles and has the potential to be generalized to other geographical areas. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

However, there have been few empirical examples of longitudinal patterns of temperature in large rivers due to a paucity of data. We constructed longitudinal thermal profiles (temperature vs distance) for 53 rivers in the Pacific Northwest (USA) using an extensive data set of remotely sensed summertime river temperatures and classified each profile into one of five patterns of downstream warming: asymptotic (increasing then flattening), linear (increasing steadily), uniform (not changing), parabolic (increasing then decreasing), or complex (not fitting other classes). We evaluated (1) how frequently profiles warmed asymptotically downstream as expected, and (2) whether relationships between river temperature and common hydroclimatic variables differed by profile class. We found considerable diversity in profile shape, with 47% of rivers warming asymptotically and 53% having alternative profile shapes. Water temperature did not warm substantially over the course of the river for coastal parabolic and uniform profiles, and for some linear and complex profiles. Profile classes showed no clear geographical trends. The degree of correlation between river temperature and hydroclimatic variables differed among profile classes, but there was overlap among classes. Water temperature in rivers with asymptotic or parabolic profiles was positively correlated with August air temperature, tributary temperature and velocity, and negatively correlated with elevation, August precipitation, gradient and distance upstream. Conversely, associations were less apparent in rivers with linear, uniform or complex profiles. Factors contributing to the unique shape of parabolic profiles differed for coastal and inland rivers, where downstream cooling was influenced locally by climate or cool water inputs, respectively. Potential drivers of shape for complex profiles were specific to each river. These thermal patterns indicate diverse thermal habitats that may promote resilience of aquatic biota to climate change. Without this spatial context, climate change models may incorrectly estimate loss of thermally suitable habitat.

Identifying the environmental filters that exert selective pressures on specific riparian vegetation guilds is a critical step in setting baseline expectations for how riparian vegetation may respond to environmental conditions anticipated under future global change scenarios. In this study, we ask: (1) What riparian plant guilds exist across the interior Columbia and upper Missouri River basins? (2) What environmental filters shape riparian guild distributions? (3) How does resource partitioning among guilds influence guild distributions and co-occurrence? Woody species composition was measured at 703 stream reaches and each species' morphological and functional attributes were extracted from a database in four categories: (1) life form, (2) persistence and growth, (3) reproduction, and (4) resource use. We clustered species into guilds by morphological characteristics and attributes related to environmental tolerances, modeling these guilds' distributions as a function of environmental filters-regional climate, watershed hydrogeomorphic characteristics, and stream channel form-and guild coexistence. We identified five guilds: (1) a tall, deeply rooted, long-lived, evergreen tree guild, (2) a xeric, disturbance tolerant shrub guild, (3) a hydrophytic, thicket-forming shrub guild, (4) a low-statured, shade-tolerant, understory shrub guild, and (5) a flood tolerant, mesoriparian shrub guild. Guilds were most strongly discriminated by species' rooting depth, canopy height and potential to resprout and grow following biomass-removing disturbance (e.g., flooding, fire). Hydro-climatic variables, including precipitation, watershed area, water table depth, and channel form attributes reflective of hydrologic regime, were predictors of guilds whose life history strategies had affinity or aversion to flooding, drought, and fluvial disturbance. Biotic interactions excluded guilds with divergent life history strategies and/or allowed for the co-occurrence of guilds that partition resources differently in the same environment. We conclude that the riparian guild framework provides insight into how disturbance and bioclimatic gradients shape riparian functional plant diversity across heterogeneous landscapes. Multiple environmental filters should be considered when the riparian response guild framework is to be used as a decision-support tool framework across large spatial extents.",2015,10.1890/ES15-00064.1,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WOS:000364024300002,Paris,,,Yes,Landscape/State-Province,CRB,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Becky,Yes,Yes,Yes,,

Our results indicate that, contrary to our initial expectations, glacier change throughout the study region cannot be explained readily by correlations in glacier location, size, or shape. Because of the large error attributable to annual variations in glacier area due to snowpack, no statistically reliable change could be detected for 444 glaciers in our study (a slight majority). Of the North Cascades glaciers that do exhibit detectable change, a majority decreased in area, but nevertheless, some were detectably growing. These findings suggest that the integration of weather patterns over time does not neatly translate into correlations with natural variations in the geometry of glaciers. Our statistical analyses of the changes observed indicate that geometric data from a large number of glaciers, as well as a surprisingly large amount of spatial change, are required for a credible statistical detection of glacier-length and area changes over a short (multidecadal) period of time.

Annual weather patterns are cold in winter and mild in summer. Precipitation has high seasonal and interannual variation and may differ by an order of magnitude between geographically close locales, depending on slope, aspect and local climatic and orographic conditions. The region's hydrology is characterized by the accumulation of winter snow, spring snowmelt and autumnal baseflows. During the 2-3-month 'spring runoff period, rivers frequently discharge > 70% of their annual water budget and have instantaneous discharges 10-100 times mean low flow. Complex weather patterns characterized by high spatial and temporal variability make predictions of future conditions tenuous. However, general patterns are identifiable; northern and western portions of the region are dominated by maritime weather patterns from the North Pacific, central areas and eastern slopes are dominated by continental air masses and southern portions receive seasonally variable atmospheric circulation from the Pacific and the Gulf of Mexico. Significant interannual variations occur in these general patterns, possibly related to ENSO (El Nino-Southern Oscillation) forcing. Changes in precipitation and temperature regimes or patterns have significant potential effects on the distribution and abundance of plants and animals. For example, elevation of the timber-line is principally a function of temperature. Palaeolimnological investigations have shown significant shifts in phyto- and zoo-plankton populations as alpine lakes shift between being above or below the timber-line. Likewise, streamside vegetation has a significant effect on stream ecosystem structure and function. Changes in stream temperature regimes result in significant changes in community composition as a consequence of bioenergetic factors. Stenothermic species could be extirpated as appropriate thermal criteria disappear. Warming temperatures may geographically isolate cole water stream fishes in increasingly confined headwaters. The heat budgets of large lakes may be affected resulting in a change of state between dimictic and warm monomictic character. Uncertainties associated with prediction are increased by the planting of fish in historically fishless, high mountain lakes and the introduction of non-native species of fishes and invertebrates into often previously simple food-webs of large valley bottom lakes and streams. Many of the streams and rivers suffer from the anthropogenic effects of abstraction and regulation. Likewise, many of the large lakes receive nutrient loads from a growing human population. We concluded that: (1) regional climate models are required to resolve adequately the complexities of the high gradient landscapes; (2) extensive wilderness preserves and national park lands, so prevalent in the Rocky Mountain Region, provide sensitive areas for differentiation of anthropogenic effects from climate effects; and (3) future research should encompass both short-term intensive studies and long-term monitoring studies developed within comprehensive experimental arrays of streams and lakes specifically designed to address the issue of anthropogenic versus climatic effects.

As such, water management in regional mountain aquifer systems, particularly in light of future projected climate change, requires an understanding of hydrogeological processes, including the complex linkages between surface and subsurface hydrology. This paper provides a brief overview of hydrogeological processes in temperate mountain regions, focusing primarily on sources of recharge to valley-bottom (or basin-bottom) aquifers. Recharge modelling in two case study areas in British Columbia (BC), Canada indicates that diffuse recharge to valley-bottom aquifers in these settings is, in general, very low (< 12% of annual precipitation in Oliver and < 24% in Grand Forks). Under current climate conditions, all recharge models show peak diffuse recharge in March and April coincident with snowmelt. Recharge declines through the summer and fall months (July through October) and attains the lowest values in January and February (when the ground is frozen and covered by snow). Future climate change in southern BC, estimated from multiple downscaled global climate models (GCMs), suggests minor increases in annual recharge due the shift (earlier) of peak recharge from increased temperature affecting earlier valley-bottom snowmelt and ground thaw. Summer recharge, currently augmented by irrigation return flow, may become more so in future due to a longer growing season assuming irrigation efficiency does not improve and crop types remain the same. Valley-bottom aquifers can receive indirect recharge through interaction with rivers. In southern BC, climate change projections suggest that peak discharge will occur earlier, winter discharge may increase, and the summer low flow period will be longer and with lower baseflow. Groundwater levels in valley-bottom aquifers will respond accordingly.",2011,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Water Resources,WOS:000361607800014,Danny,Maybe,Yes,Maybe,Landscape/State-Province,Unable to Find,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Becky,,,,????,

As a basis for our quantification, we use the stratigraphic record offered by a 3.5 km(2) large fan that we explore with a seismic survey, stratigraphic analyses of drillhole material, and C-14 ages measured on organic matter encountered in these drillings. In addition, we calculate past denudation rate variability in the fan deposits using concentrations of cosmogenic Be-10. We merge this information into a scenario of how the sediment flux has changed through time and how this variability can be related to climatic variations, framed within well-known paraglacial models. The results document a highly complex natural system. From the LGM to the very early Holocene, ice-melted discharge and climate variability promoted a high sediment flux (sedimentation rate up to 40 mm/yr). This flux then dramatically decreased toward interglacial values (0.8 mm/yr at 5-4 calibrated kyr B.P.). However, in contrast to the trend of classic paraglacial models, the flux recorded at Zielbach shows secondary peaks at 6.5 ka and 2.5 ka, with values of 13 mm/yr and 1.5 mm/yr, respectively. Paleo-denudation rates also decrease from similar to 33 mm/yr at the beginning of the Holocene to 0.42 mm/yr at 5 ka, with peaks of similar to 6 mm/yr and 1.1 mm/yr at 6.5 ka and 2.5 ka. High-amplitude climate change is the most likely cause of the secondary peaks, but anthropogenic activities may have contributed as well.

While several comprehensive paleotemperature reconstructions have been developed across Europe, only a few quantitative high-resolution studies exist for precipitation. Here we present a calibration and verification study of lithoclastic sediment proxies from proglacial Lake Oeschinen (46A degrees 30'N, 7A degrees 44'E, 1,580 m a.s.l., north-west Swiss Alps) that are sensitive to rainfall for the period AD 1901-2008. We collected two sediment cores, one in 2007 and another in 2011. The sediments are characterized by two facies: (A) mm-laminated clastic varves and (B) turbidites. The annual character of the laminae couplets was confirmed by radiometric dating (Pb-210, Cs-137) and independent flood-layer chronomarkers. Individual varves consist of a dark sand-size spring-summer layer enriched in siliciclastic minerals and a lighter clay-size calcite-rich winter layer. Three subtypes of varves are distinguished: Type I with a 1-1.5 mm fining upward sequence; Type II with a distinct fine-sand base up to 3 mm thick; and Type III containing multiple internal microlaminae caused by individual summer rainstorm deposits. Delta-fan surface samples and sediment trap data fingerprint different sediment source areas and transport processes from the watershed and confirm the instant response of sediment flux to rainfall and erosion. Based on a highly accurate, precise and reproducible chronology, we demonstrate that sediment accumulation (varve thickness) is a quantitative predictor for cumulative boreal alpine spring (May-June) and spring/summer (May-August) rainfall (r(MJ) = 0.71, r(MJJA) = 0.60, p < 0.01).

A 95-year-long sediment record was recovered from the lake. Principal components analysis (PCA) and redundancy analysis of fossil chironomid data were performed to determine the controlling factors on the chironomid community. The four prominent environmental controls were summer air temperature, organic matter C:N ratio (C-org:N), dry mass accumulation rate (DMAR), and total nitrogen. C-org:N proved to be the most important controlling factor through time. However, C-org:N and summer air temperature were highly co-linear, possibly due to temperature directly impacting lake productivity (and thus C:N ratios) through increased stratification and a longer growing season. PCA Axis 1 scores were a strong predictor of summer temperatures even after DMAR was factored out to account for direct human influences. The strong temperature-chironomid relationship over the last 50 years could be due to the lake becoming more responsive to climate warming after cultural eutrophication of the 1950s, as lakes with higher nutrient loads are shown to be more responsive to the effects of climate warming.",2013,10.1007/s10750-013-1615-5,Marine & Freshwater Biology,WOS:000324636600015,Adrienne,No,Maybe,No,,,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Courtney,,,International,China,

It has been found through a combination of field measurements and satellite observations that glaciers in this region appear to be reacting differently to contemporary climate change than those in other regions. This region has exhibited a relatively large number of either static or advancing glaciers while other glaciers in the central and eastern Himalayas, as well as around the world, are nearly all retreating. The amount of precipitation received in the Karakoram region depends on the interplay between two climate systems: the westerly winds flowing over the Mediterranean and Caspian Seas, and the South Asian monsoon winds (also referred to as the Indian monsoon) flowing over the Indian Ocean. This study extends the modeling time frame by performing time-slice calculations for the Karakoram region through the twenty-first century. Despite regionwide simulated temperature changes, the highly elevated regions of the Karakoram Mountain range experience positive climatic mass balance until the end of the modeling time period. This result arises from a strong positive correlation between climatic mass balance and simulated increases in regional precipitation, which outweighs the negative correlation between climatic mass balance and simulated increases in temperature. Also, the extreme elevations within the Karakoram allow regional alpine glaciers to benefit from a strong elevation-dependent signal simulated in net snowfall accumulation, and hence climatic mass balance.",2012,10.1175/JCLI-D-11-00436.1,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,WOS:000312107300017,Becky,No,Yes,No,,Karakoram Mountain range in the greater Himalayas,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Courtney,,,International,,

In New Zealand, little is known about the long-term variability of the snow cover and the expected impacts of climate change on snow cover. The lack of systematic historical snow observations in New Zealand means that information on interannual variability, trends and projections of future seasonal snow must be generated using simulation models. We use a temperature index snow model to calculate the accumulation and ablation of the current (1980-1999) snowpack for more than 37,000 third-order river basins with 100 m contour intervals, resulting in over 200,000 individual model elements in New Zealand. Using this model, which captures the gross features of snow under the current climate, we assess the range of likely effects of climate change on seasonal snow in New Zealand using downscaled temperature and precipitation changes from the middle of the road (A1B) climate change projections from 12 general circulation models (GCMs). For each of the 12 GCMs, we consider two future time periods 2030-2049 (mid-point reference 2040) and 2080-2099 (mid-point reference 2090). These future time periods are compared to simulations of current, 1980-1999 (mid-point reference 1990), seasonal snow. Our results show that on average at a national scale, at nearly all elevations, the 2040s and 2090s result in a decrease in snow as described by all of our summary statistics: snow duration, percentage of precipitation that is snow and peak snow accumulation in each year. This decrease in snow is more marked at elevations below 1,000 m but is evident at all but the very highest elevations. Relative to snow simulations for average peak snow accumulation for the present, we observe that by the 2040s, depending on the GCM used, there is a reduction of between 3 and 44 % at 1,000 m, and an increase of 8 % through to a reduction of 22 % at 2,000 m. By the 2090s, the average reduction is greater, with a decrease of between 32 and 79 % at 1,000 m and between 6 and 51 % at 2,000 m. More substantial reductions are observed below these elevations. When we consider the elevation where snow duration exceeds 3 months, we see a rise in this elevation from 1,550 m in the 1990s to between 1,550 and 1,750 m by the 2040s and 1,700 and 2,000 m by the 2090s, depending on the GCM used.

Furthermore, we consider how biogeographical and genetic results can be combined to guide global conservation strategies. Location The Mediterranean region. Methods We started from a detailed analysis of the scientific literature (1993-2007) in order to identify refugia in the Mediterranean region, based on intra-specific phylogeographical studies of plant species. We used population locations together with gene-pool identity to establish the database, comparing patterns of phylogeographical concordance with the locations of Mediterranean refugia. We then tested the biogeographical congruence between two biodiversity components, namely phylogeographical refugia and regional hotspots. Results We identified 52 refugia in the Mediterranean bioclimatic region and confirmed the role played by the three major peninsulas, with a shared total of 25 refugia. We emphasize the importance of areas that have previously been attributed a lesser role (large Mediterranean islands, North Africa, Turkey, Catalonia). Of the 52 refugia identified, 33 are situated in the western Mediterranean Basin and 19 in the eastern part. The locations of the phylogeographically defined refugia are significantly associated with the 10 regional hotspots of plant biodiversity, with 26 of these refugia (i.e. 50%) occurring within the hotspots. Main conclusions The locations of refugia are determined by complex historical and environmental factors, the cumulative effects of which need to be considered because they have occurred since the Tertiary, rather than solely during the last glacial period. Refugia represent climatically stable areas and constitute a high conservation priority as key areas for the long-term persistence of species and genetic diversity, especially given the threat posed by the extensive environmental change processes operating in the Mediterranean region. The refugia defined here represent 'phylogeographical hotspots'; that is, significant reservoirs of unique genetic diversity favourable to the evolutionary processes of Mediterranean plant species.",2009,10.1111/j.1365-2699.2008.02051.x,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Physical Geography,WOS:000267129400010,Courtney,No,,No,,Mediterranean,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Courtney,,,International,mediterranean,

Two sets of in situ experiments were conducted: (1) On July 2006, F-v/F-m was measured throughout the day at different depths (0.1, 0.25, 0.5 and 1 m) and in the afternoon. ETR and phenolic compounds were determined. In addition, in order to analyze the effect of UV radiation, F-v/F-m was determined in algae incubated for 3 days at 0.5m under three different light treatments: PAR+UVA+UVB (PAB). PAR+UVA (PA) and PAR (P). (2) On August 2007, F-v/F-m was determined under PAB, PA and P treatments and desiccation/rehydration conditions. F-v/F-m decreased in algae growing in surface waters (0.1 m) but also at 1 m depth compared to that at 0.5 in depth. The decrease of F-v/F-m at noon due to photoinhibition was small (less than 10%) except in algae growing at 1 m depth (44%). The maximal electron transport rate was 3.5-5 times higher in algae growing at 0.25-0.5 m respectively than that at 0.1 and 1 m depth. These results are related to the accumulation of phenolic compounds: i.e. the algae at 0.25-0.5 in presentedrespectively about a 3-5 times higher concentration of phenolic compounds than that of algae at 0.1-1 m depth. The protection mechanisms seem to be stimulated by UVB radiation, since F-v/F-m was higher in the presence of UVB (PAB treatment) compared to PA or P treatments. UVA exerts the main photoinhibitory effect, not Only at midday, but also in the afternoon. UVB radiation also had a protective effect in algae grown under desiccation conditions for three days. During re-hydration, the rapid increase of F-v/F-m (after 1 h) was higher in the UVB-grown algae than in algae grown under UVA radiation. After 5 h. F-v/F-m values were similar in algae submitted to desiccation/rehydration under PAB and P treatments as they were in the control (submerged algae). The combined effect of desiccation and UVA produced the greatest decrease of photosynthesis in Z. decussata. Thifs UVB, in contrast to other species, may support the recovery process. Z. decussata can acclimate to severe stress, conditions in this high mountain lake by the photoprotection mechanism induced by UVB radiation through dynamic photoinhibition and the accumulation of phenolic compounds (UV screen and antioxidant substances).",2009,10.3274/JL09-68-2-05,Marine & Freshwater Biology,WOS:000268778300005,Courtney,No,,No,,Spain,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Courtney,,,International,,

We report here the transport of suspended sediment and solutes during the snowmelt period in a small experimental catchment in the subalpine belt of the Central Spanish Pyrenees. The seasonality of hydrological and sediment responses throughout the year was investigated using daily data of discharge, suspended sediment transport and solute outputs of the hydrological years 2003/2004 and 2005/2006. The study demonstrated the importance of the snowmelt period in terms of runoff production, and solute and suspended sediment yield: whereas precipitation during the snowmelt period (2-2.5 months) represented 10-13% of annual precipitation, discharge and suspended sediment transport accounted for up to 50% and 60%, respectively, and solute output approximately 40-50%. Solute transport dominated throughout the snowmelt period, whereas suspended sediment transport mostly occurred during the second phase of the snowmelt period (June), when an expanding area of the catchment was free from snow. The moderate daily increases in discharge, which were related to day night temperature fluctuations, were insufficient to transport bedload material. Hourly data were used for preliminary assessment of the relationships among discharge, suspended sediment, and solute concentration, which provided insights into sediment sources and delivery mechanisms. Thus, during snowmelt-related events, the sediment mobilized was most probably derived from areas near or within the channel. In contrast, during events involving both snowmelt and rainfall, the gully system near the divide contributed to sediment load. The solute concentration was inversely related to water discharge, with higher concentrations during the first half of the snowmelt period (May) than during the second half (June). The results of this study demonstrate the key role of snow accumulation and melting processes in controlling the hydrological dynamics and patterns of particulate and solute mobilization in high-mountain environments. Future changes in snow volume and duration will affect the timing of snowmelt-related spring high flows, as well as soil erosion and transport.",2011,10.1657/1938-4246-43.2.213,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Physical Geography,WOS:000291118700006,Danny,No,Yes,No,Landscape/State-Province,Central Pyranees,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Courtney,,,International,,

This work provides biological and ecological data on one rare European self-sustaining population through three-years of data collection in the Lemme Creek (Northern Apennines, Italy). Regular reproductive events were recorded and analysed: gonad maturation, the presence of nests, juveniles and the rearing of alevins from naturally hatched eggs confirmed that the reproductive period is in the first months of the year. Biometric and population parameters are comparable to values recorded for the species, with a density of 0.60 +/- 0.21 individuals/m(2), a biomass of 5.18 +/- 2.75 g/m(2) and a weight/length relationship W = 5 E-05L(2.69).

Decrease in phosphate sorption properties was observed in transects from the littoral zone to dry land (up to the high water mark) in both lakes concomitantly with loss of amorphous oxides of iron and aluminum as revealed by oxalate and dithionite extractions. X-ray diffraction did not indicate increased amounts of crystalline metal oxides, but there was a loss of fine particles (< 20 mu m) with distance from the shore, probably due to wind erosion. Likely this explains the loss of amorphous metal oxides as they are often enriched in the fine sediment fraction. Changes in P-speciation toward less available pools were also observed as a result of desiccation. When re-wetted under oxic conditions, the sediments, especially those closest to the shore, released phosphate to the overlying water. The loss of adsorption capacity for phosphate upon re-wetting was associated with loss of amorphous iron oxides, and the changes appear to be non-reversible. Thus, both desiccation and re-wetting will lead to a decrease in sediment phosphate sorption capacity and increased water level fluctuations, a possible scenario in climate change, can therefore increase P availability in the water column of these oligotrophic systems.",NA,,,,Danny,No,Yes,No,Ecosystem/Municipal,Spain,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Courtney,,,International,Spain,

The tree-ring growth response of stone pine (Pinus cembra L.) to climatic variability was studied in the Alps. The aims were (i) to assess tree-ring growth patterns at different spatial-temporal scales; (ii) to identify the climate parameters that explain most of the variability in radial growth at different time domains; and (iii) to study past and current trends in radial growth and climate-growth relationships at different locations. 2. High- and low-frequency stone pine chronologies were compiled for 30 treeline sites on the French and Italian Alps. We used gridded climate data computed from 200 years of instrumental records from an extensive Alpine network. Climate-growth relationships were computed with bootstrap correlation functions and their stationarity and consistency over time assessed with moving correlation. 3. No spatial patterns were detected in stone pine chronology statistics despite the regional clustering observed in tree-ring series and climate responses. This can be attributed to (i) local weather variability; (ii) different biophysical conditions caused by soil moisture, solar radiation, snowmelt dynamics and growing season length; and (iii) forest stand history and age structure, the expression of long-term land use and disturbances. 4. The exceptionally long-term climate records allowed significant stone pine growth response changes to be assessed at both annual and decadal time scales. Winter conditions and spring-summer temperatures mainly affected the growing season length, in addition to site carbon and water balance. Most of these limiting factors varied spatially and temporally along the latitudinal and longitudinal gradients in response to the corresponding changes in local conditions. 5.

Data on water quality, invertebrate and fish populations were collected for 2 years before construction and for the following 3 years covering the construction period and the initial period of the farm's operation. In contrast to previous studies, the impacts of the wind farm development were assessed for a suite of potentially affected hydrochemical variables using a before-after-control-impact (BACI) analysis that allowed separation of construction effects from spatial and temporal variability in hydroclimatological conditions, thereby providing an improved, more robust evidence base. Therewas a small but significant negative effect of construction on pH, alkalinity (Alk) and acid neutralising capacity (ANC) in the upper part of the treatment catchment, which was where the wind farm was situated. The effects were more marked under higher flow conditions. It is hypothesised that this reflects changes in hydrological processes with increased near-surface runoff or organic acid mobilisation.

The relevance of the work stems from the increasing scientific interest concerning the impacts of the warming climate on water resources management and temperature-controlled ecological processes. The description of the advective energy fluxes is cast in a travel time formulation of water and energy transport, resulting in a closed form solution for water temperature evolution in the soil compartment. The application to Alpine catchments hinges on the boundary conditions provided by the fully distributed and physically based snow model Alpine3D. The performance of the simulations is illustrated by comparing modeled and measured hydrographs and thermographs at the outlet of the Dischma catchment (45 km(2)) in the Swiss Alps. The Monte Carlo calibration shows that the model is robust and that a simultaneous fitting of streamflow and stream temperature reduces the uncertainty in the hydrological parameters estimation. The calibrated model also provides a good fit to the measurements in the validation period, suggesting that it could be employed for predictive applications, both for hydrological and ecological purposes. The temperature of the subsurface flow, as described by the proposed travel time formulation, proves warmer than the stream temperature during winter and colder during summer. Finally, the spatially explicit results of the model during snowmelt show a notable hydrothermal spatial variability in the river network, owing to the small spatial correlation of infiltration and meteorological forcings in Alpine regions.",2015,10.1002/2014WR016228,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Water Resources,WOS:000353158800017,Micah,No,No,No,,location?,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Courtney,,,International,swiss alps,

Some of the reasons why these ""snow towers"" do not exist in nature are vertical and lateral transport processes. While snow transport models have been developed using grid cell sizes of tens to hundreds of square metres and have been applied in several catchments, no model exists using coarser cell sizes of 1 km(2), which is a common resolution for meso-and large-scale hydrologic modelling (hundreds to thousands of square kilometres). In this paper we present an approach that uses only gravity and snow density as a proxy for the age of the snow cover and land-use information to redistribute snow in alpine basins. The results are based on the hydrological modelling of the Austrian Inn Basin in Tyrol, Austria, more specifically the Otztaler Ache catchment, but the findings hold for other tributaries of the river Inn. This transport model is implemented in the distributed rainfall-runoff model COSERO (Continuous Semidistributed Runoff). The results of both model concepts with and without consideration of lateral snow redistribution are compared against observed discharge and snow-covered areas derived from MODIS satellite images. By means of the snow redistribution concept, snow accumulation over several years can be prevented and the snow depletion curve compared with MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) data could be improved, too. In a 7-year period the standard model would lead to snow accumulation of approximately 2900mm SWE (snow water equivalent) in high elevated regions whereas the updated version of the model does not show accumulation and does also predict discharge with more accuracy leading to a Kling-Gupta efficiency of 0.93 instead of 0.9. A further improvement can be shown in the comparison of MODIS snow cover data and the calculated depletion curve, where the redistribution model increased the efficiency (R-2) from 0.70 to 0.78 (calibration) and from 0.66 to 0.74 (validation).",2015,10.5194/hess-19-4517-2015,Geology; Water Resources,WOS:000365981100008,Micah,No,No,No,,Austria,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Courtney,,,International,,

Stable isotope paleoaltimetry exploits systematic decreases in the oxygen (delta O-18) or hydrogen (delta D) isotopic composition of precipitation along a mountain front when the interaction of topography and advected moist air masses induces orographic precipitation. These changes in delta O-18 or delta D can be recovered from the geologic record and recent geochemical and modeling advances allow a broad range of proxy materials to be evaluated. Over the last 10 yr stable isotope paleoaltimetry has witnessed rapidly expanding research activities and has produced a broad array of fascinating tectonic and geomorphologic studies many of which have concentrated on determining the elevation history of continental plateau regions. These single-site studies have greatly expanded what used to be very sparse global paleoaltimetric data. The challenge now lies in disentangling the surface uplift component from the impact of climate change on delta O-18 and delta D in precipitation. The robustness of stable isotope paleoaltimetry can be enhanced when high-elevation delta O-18 or delta D data are referenced against low-elevation sites that track climate-modulated sea level delta O-18 or delta D of precipitation through time ('delta-delta approach'). Analysis of central Andean paleosols documents that differences in delta O-18 of soil carbonate between the Subandean foreland and the Bolivian Altiplano are small between 11 and 7 Ma but rise rapidly to ca. 2.9 parts per thousand after 7 Ma, corroborating the magnitude of late Miocene change in delta O-18 on the Altiplano. Future advances in stable isotope paleoaltimetry will greatly benefit from addressing four key challenges: (1) Identifying topographically-induced changes in atmospheric circulation and associated teleconnections in the global climate system that affect delta O-18 or delta D of precipitation; (2) Evaluating on a case-by-case basis if temporal and spatial changes in isotope lapse rates influence interpretations of paleoelevation; (3) Interfacing with phylogenetic techniques to evaluate competing hypotheses with respect to the timing of surface uplift and the diversification of lineages; (4) Characterizing feedbacks between changes in surface elevation and atmospheric circulation as these are likely to be equally important to the diversification of lineages than changes in surface elevation alone. Tackling these challenges will benefit from the accelerating pace of improved data-model comparisons and rapidly evolving geochemical techniques for reconstructing precipitation patterns. Most importantly, stable isotope paleoaltimetry has the potential to develop into a truly interdisciplinary field if innovative tectonic/paleoclimatic and evolutionary biology/phylogenetic approaches are integrated into a common research framework. It therefore, opens new avenues to study the long-term evolution of landscapes and life. (C) 201 5 Elsevier B.V.

The Basin is part of the continental drainage system and the main physiographic and biotic corridor for peopling of the transitive coastal interior SE Primor'ye Region. The Final Pleistocene and Holocene environmental (biotic and abiotic) proxy records from the Upper/Final Palaeolithic to early historical sites document a dynamic climate change with vegetation cover transformations within riverine and mountain valley ecosystems of the Russian Far East. Most of the archaeological sites located on the low terraces and bedrock promontories along the main river channel and its tributary streams suggest traditional hunter gathered lifestyles based on seasonal salmon-fishing supplemented by pastoral economy. Tundra-forests with larch trees, dwarf birch thickets and polypod ferns from the basal stratigraphic units of the late Last Glacial occupation sites associated with the Upper Palaeolithic micro-blade and bifacial stone tool traditions (C-14-dated to 19,000-12,000 cal yrs BP) indicate rather pronounced conditions and much lower MAT comparing today. Following a final Pleistocene cooling event, a major climate warming marked the onset of Holocene accompanied by a regional humidity increase promoting the formation of a mixed broadleaved-coniferous oak-dominant taiga, and culminating in the mid Holocene Climatic Optimum. The appearance of mosaic parklands ca. 5,000-4,000 cal yrs BP. may be partly attributed to the expansion of the Far Eastern Neolithic cultures practicing forest clearance for pastures and dwellings. A progressing landscape opening indicated by the spread of light-demanding thickets and birch-dominated riverine 'biotopes with Artemisia suggests a further vegetation cover transformation during the late Neolithic and the early Palaeo-Metal (Bronze Age) periods. This trend corroborates the documented climate deterioration between 3,400 and 2,600 cal yrs BP, causing a regional aridification with a parkland-steppe broadening in the main SE Primor'ye river valleys. The late Holocene climate development persisted until the Little Ice Age which led to formation of the present settlement ecosystems with mixed (oak/cedar/fir-dominated) temperate maritime woodlands.

Here, we test for early life history growth variation in dimorphic Arctic char as a proximate explanation for the observed life history variation between the two forms. Char were sampled in 11 alpine and Arctic Norwegian lakes. Dwarfs (defined as sexually mature char less than 15 cm long; N=304) had a mean total length of 105 mm, whereas the typical cannibal (body length above 20 cm; N=153) was 388 mm long. A positive correlation between egg size and otolith hatching ring were ascertained in a separate hatching experiment with brown trout (Salmo trutta) and it is assumed that this relationship also is valid for Arctic char, and otolith size was used as a proxy for length. Otolith hatching ring from Arctic char cannibals was larger (mean +/- SD; 187 +/- 24 mu m) than those from dwarfs (mean +/- SD; 164 +/- 23 mu m). There were only minor size differences between dwarfs and cannibals during the next three years, after which dwarfs usually matured. Two mutually nonexclusive, proximate explanations for the differentiation into separate morphs (dwarfs and cannibals) are therefore maternal effects and/or genetic based differentiation.

A long-term, high-resolution understanding of the lake's retreat and expansion and the driving mechanisms will inform future adaptive water management strategies, ecosystem restoration, and government decision-making in the context of a growing water scarcity in the inland river basin. The shrubs that grow along the shore of a lake often provide evidence of lake retreat or expansion. The chronological results showed that the earliest germination dates of the lakeshore shrubs, tamarisk, were in 1901, 1943, 1966, 2009, and 1990 from the higher terrace to the lower terrace of East Juyan Lake, a terminal lake of China's Heihe River. Coupled with river and lake hydrological data, six obvious lake's fluctuations were identified: shrinkage from 1900 to 1940s and during the early 1990s, expansion and retreat in the late 1950s and early 1970s, continued expansion from 2002 to 2008, and stabilization at a water area of around 40 km(2) from 2009 to the present. The water elevation in the 1900s was below 905 m a.s.l., resulting in a water area < 80 km(2), but decreased to 40 km(2) after 1960 and dried up completely by the 1990s. By analysing climatic and hydrological records since 1950, tree-ring climate proxy data, river runoff outside the observation period, and water resource consumption in the middle and lower reaches of the Heihe River, we found that the periodic expansion and retreat of East Juyan Lake was influenced by both climate change and human activities, but especially by human activities.

Concomitant cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum L.) invasions, plant community transitions and a warming climate in recent decades along grassland-shrubland-woodland-xeric forest transitions have promoted frequent and large wildfires, and continuance of the trend appears likely if warming climate conditions prevail. These changes potentially increase overall hydrologic vulnerability by spatially and temporally increasing soil exposure to runoff and erosion processes. Plot and hillslope-scale studies demonstrate burning may increase event runoff or erosion by factors of 2-40 over small-plot scales and more than 100-fold over large-plot to hillslope scales. Reports of flooding and debris flow events from rangelands and xeric forests following burning show the potential risk to natural resources, property, infrastructure and human life. We present a conceptual model for evaluating post-fire hydrologic vulnerability and risk. We suggest that post-fire risk assessment of potential hydrologic hazards should adopt a probability-based approach that considers varying site susceptibility in conjunction with a range of potential storms and that determines the hydrologic response magnitudes likely to affect values-at-risk. Our review suggests that improved risk assessment requires better understanding in several key areas including quantification of interactions between varying storm intensities and measures of site susceptibility, the varying effects of soil water repellency, and the spatial scaling of post-fire hydrologic response across rangeland-xeric forest plant communities.",2014,10.1071/WF12161,Forestry,WOS:000334100800001,Adrienne,Yes,Yes,Yes,Biome/National,Do we want to include review papers?,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Courtney,Yes,,Maybe,Review paper western US,

An experiment was conducted in which soil cores were reciprocally transplanted between immediately adjacent forests and meadows at two high elevation (-1,600 m) sites (Carpenter and Lookout) in the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest located in the Cascade Mountains of Oregon. Half of the cores were placed in PVC pipe (closed) to prevent new root colonization, whereas the other cores were placed in mesh bags (open) to allow recolonization by fine roots. A duplicate set of open and closed soil cores was not transferred between sites and was incubated in place. After 2 year, soil cores were removed and changes in fungal and bacterial biomasses determined using light microscopy, and changes in microbial community composition determined by PLFA analysis, and by length heterogeneity PCR of the internal transcribed spacer region of fungal ribosomal DNA. At both sites soil microbial community structures had responded to treatments after 2 year of incubation. At Carpenter, both fungal and bacterial community structures of forest soil changed significantly in response to transfer from forest to meadow, with the shift in fungal community structure being accompanied by a significant decrease in the PLFA biomarker of fungal biomass, 18:2 omega 6,9.

Changing disturbance regimes are of particular concern in this context due to their high potential impact on ecosystem structure, function and composition. Resilience-based stewardship is advocated to address these changes in ecosystem management, but its operational implementation has remained challenging. We review observed and expected changes in disturbance regimes and their potential impacts on provisioning, regulating, cultural and supporting ecosystem services, concentrating on temperate and boreal forests. Subsequently, we focus on resilience as a powerful concept to quantify and address these changes and their impacts, and present an approach towards its operational application using established methods from disturbance ecology. We suggest using the range of variability concept - characterizing and bounding the long-term behaviour of ecosystems - to locate and delineate the basins of attraction of a system. System recovery in relation to its range of variability can be used to measure resilience of ecosystems, allowing inferences on both engineering resilience (recovery rate) and monitoring for regime shifts (directionality of recovery trajectory). It is important to consider the dynamic nature of these properties in ecosystem analysis and management decision-making, as both disturbance processes and mechanisms of resilience will be subject to changes in the future. Furthermore, because ecosystem services are at the interface between natural and human systems, the social dimension of resilience (social adaptive capacity and range of variability) requires consideration in responding to changing disturbance regimes in forests.Synthesis and applications. Based on examples from temperate and boreal forests we synthesize principles and pathways for fostering resilience to changing disturbance regimes in ecosystem management. We conclude that future work should focus on testing and implementing these pathways in different contexts to make ecosystem services provisioning more robust to changing disturbance regimes and advance our understanding of how to cope with change and uncertainty in ecosystem management.",2016,10.1111/1365-2664.12511,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WOS:000368088300015,Paris,No,Yes,No,,"theory, no application",NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Courtney,Yes,Yes,Maybe,too broad.

This has left divergent perspectives about how to restore dry forests, protect people and infrastructure from fire, and interpret the ecological effects of large fires, such as the 2013 Rim fire, a human-set 104,000 ha fire in the western Sierra Nevada Mountains. To help resolve this uncertainty, I used new methods to reconstruct historical forest structure and fire and test 11 hypotheses about them, using A.D. 1865-1885 General Land Office surveys, across 330,000 ha of Sierran mixed-conifer forests. The reconstructions show these historical forests were open and park-like in places, but generally dense, averaging 293 trees/ ha; shade-tolerant trees and large trees were abundant, but smaller (<60 cm diameter) pines and oaks numerically dominated. These smaller trees, along with common understory seedlings and saplings and almost pervasive shrubs, created abundant ladder fuels. It is not surprising, given these conditions, that just 13-26% of historical Sierran mixed-conifer forests had only low-severity fire, with mixed-severity fire over 43-48%, and high-severity fire over 31-39% of the land area. The high-severity fire rotation was 281 years in the northern and 354 years in the southern Sierra, short enough to contribute to high levels of heterogeneity, including abundant areas and large patches (up to 9400 ha) of early-successional forest and montane chaparral, but long enough to allow recovery of old-growth forest over large land areas. Proposals to reduce fuels and fire severity would actually reduce, not restore, historical forest heterogeneity important to wildlife and resiliency. Sierran mixed-conifer forests are inherently dangerous places to live, which cannot be changed without creating artificial forests over large land areas. However, people can adapt to fires by channeling development to safer areas and modifying ignition zones near houses and communities to survive fire.",2014,10.1890/ES14-00046.1,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WOS:000345096600002,Adrienne,No,Yes,No,,,NA,,,,,,Meghan,No,Maybe,No,CA,Courtney,No,,No,Sierras,

Improved methods for assessment of the risk of pest establishment are needed to enhance informed decision-making, to develop cost-effective pest management strategies, and to design quarantine policies for preventing the spread of pests. We evaluated the capabilities of a correlative and a process-based mechanistic niche model, and their combination, to assess the risk of pest establishment. The correlative model MaxEnt and the process-based mechanistic model CLIMEX were used to assess the risk of establishment of western cherry fruit fly, Rhagoletis indifferens Curran (Diptera: Tephritidae) in California. We integrated R. indifferens occurrence records and spatial environmental variables using MaxEnt to assess the potential risk of establishment of this pest. The CLIMEX model was developed using eco-physiological tolerances of R. indifferens. The predictive performance of the MaxEnt model improved by including the host species' distribution and Ecoclimatic Index generated using the CLIMEX model. The best model predicted no risk for R. indifferens establishment in the Central Valley around the areas where sweet cherries are produced in California. Most of the high to very high risk areas for R. indifferens were predicted in northern parts of California and the Sierra Nevada Mountains, where the fly exists on its native host, bitter cherry [Prunus emarginata (Douglas) Eaton]. Precipitation of driest quarter, degree days with average temperatures >= 8.3 degrees C, degree days with average temperatures <= 58 degrees C, and mean diurnal range in temperature were the strongest predictors of R. indifferens distribution in western North America. We showed that the predictive power of correlative niche models can be improved by including outputs from the process-based mechanistic niche models. Overall results suggest that R. indifferens is unlikely to establish in the commercial cherry-growing areas in the Central Valley of California, largely because heat stress is too high and chilling requirement in those areas is not met.",2014,10.1890/ES14-00050.1,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WOS:000345096600009,Adrienne,No,Yes,No,,,NA,,,,,,Micah,Yes,Yes,Yes,Western US ,Courtney,No,,No,California,

However, understanding stream temperature response to environmental change in mountain regions is difficult because there is typically a lack of observations. This work aims to address this issue by coupling two process-based models to simulate stream temperature in a groundwater-dominated mountain catchment, Alberta, Canada, and using a reach-scale field study for model development and verification. Results suggest that it is possible to produce spatial simulations of hydrometeorological variables needed for process-based stream temperature modelling. Simulated stream energy budget estimates compare well with results from field-based studies, and errors in stream temperature simulations (RMSE < 1.6) are similar to other modelling studies, providing confidence in the methods developed. Model sensitivity analysis demonstrates the importance of incorporating meteorological, hydrological, and geomorphological controls on stream temperature in modelling studies. This study also demonstrates the current lack of process knowledge regarding in-stream ice cover and snowmelt effects on stream temperature, both of which can contribute substantially to stream thermal regimes. Future field-based and modelling studies should consider these processes in order to fully understand stream temperature response to environmental change. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Classification trees showed that outbreaks can be predicted most successfully from above average annual AMO values and above average summer VPD values, indicators of drought across Colorado. Notably, we find that spruce beetle outbreaks appear to be predicted best by interannual to multidecadal variability in drought, not by temperature alone. This finding may imply that spruce beetle outbreaks are triggered by decreases in host tree defenses, which are hypothesized to occur with drought stress.

Observations of precipitation and temperature are more common than other variables; consequently, radiation, humidity, pressure, and wind speed often must be either estimated using empirical relationships with precipitation and temperature or obtained from numerical weather prediction models. This study examines two climate forcing datasets using different methods to estimate radiative energy fluxes and humidity and investigates the effects of the choice of forcing data on hydrologic simulations over the mountainous upper Colorado River basin (293 472 km(2)). Comparisons of model simulations forced by two climate datasets illustrate that the methods used to estimate shortwave radiation impact hydrologic states and fluxes, particularly at high elevation (e.g., ~20% difference in runoff above 3000-m elevation), substantially altering the timing of snowmelt and runoff (~20 days difference) and the partitioning of precipitation between evapotranspiration and runoff. The different forcing datasets also exhibit differences in hydrologic sensitivity to interannual temperature at high elevation. The results suggest that the choice of forcing dataset is an important consideration when conducting climate impact assessments and the subsequent applications of these assessments for water resources planning and management.",2014,10.1175/JHM-D-13-036.1,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,WOS:000332301900027,Adrienne,No,Yes,No,,,Meghan,,,No,,,NA,,,,,Courtney,No,,No,Colorado River Basin,

Among vascular plants, graminoids colonized most quickly, and woody species were largely absent. Species with the highest frequency and greatest abundance in the disturbed area also were common and abundant in the undisturbed community. Bryophytes appeared to be colonizing no more quickly than vascular plants. Treeline and elevation exerted separate effects on community structure and recovery. Treeline influenced species richness, abundance, and the rate of recovery of vascular plants, but there was no evidence of an additional effect of elevation either above or below treeline. Treeline also influenced species richness of bryophytes and lichens. In addition, elevation appeared to have a separate effect on their rate of recovery in alpine habitat: species richness of bryophytes and lichens declined with elevation in the disturbed community but not in the undisturbed community. This suggests that elevation has a transient effect on colonization and/or survival, but only above treeline. In general, recovery has occurred more quickly below treeline.

Four catchments are snow-dominated, and four receive a mix of rain and snow. Results of diagnostic tools of mixing models indicate that Ca2+, Mg2+, K+ and Cl- behaved conservatively in the streamflow at all catchments, reflecting mixing of three endmembers. Using endmember mixing analysis, the endmembers were determined to be snowmelt runoff (including rain on snow), subsurface flow and fall storm runoff. In seven of the eight catchments, streamflow was dominated by subsurface flow, with an average relative contribution (% of streamflow discharge) greater than 60%. Snowmelt runoff contributed less than 40%, and fall storm runoff less than 7% on average. Streamflow peaked 2-4weeks earlier at mixed rain-snow than snow-dominated catchments, but relative endmember contributions were not significantly different between the two groups of catchments. Both soil water in the unsaturated zone and regional groundwater were not significant contributors to streamflow. The contributions of snowmelt runoff and subsurface flow, when expressed as discharge, were linearly correlated with streamflow discharge (R-2 of 0.85-0.99). These results suggest that subsurface flow is generated from the soil-bedrock interface through preferential pathways and is not very sensitive to snow-rain proportions. Thus, a declining of the snow-rain ratio under a warming climate should not systematically affect the processes controlling the streamflow generation at these catchments.

Thus, research that examines potential impacts of shifting disturbance regimes on ecosystem properties and processes in these forests is needed. We examined short-term effects (up to one year after treatment) of three treatments that emulated MPB attack and associated forest management disturbance (i.e., moderate and high intensity simulated MPB attack, salvage harvest) on above-and below-ground properties and processes of mature lodgepole pine forests in MPB's recently expanded range east of the Rockies. While the salvage logging treatment showed dramatic effects on the understory plant community and downed woody material with several less dramatic below-ground responses, there were no effects of the moderate MPB attack, and only limited below-ground responses to the high intensity attack. The salvage logged stands showed decreases in species richness and understory plant cover, increases in small downed wood, litter cover, forest floor pH, and plant available Ca, Mg, and P, and differences in multiple microbial properties compared with the other treatments. The high intensity simulated MPB attack showed increased respiration rates of several carbon substrates compared with the salvage treatment. There was considerable variation among years for many below-ground variables (e.g., multiple soil nutrients, microbial respiration rates and phospholipid fatty acids), and these were unrelated to treatments. For the majority of below-ground response variables, differences among study years rather than differences due to the MPB treatments suggest that inter-annual variability exerts a stronger influence than does disturbance effects of MPB red attack. The lack of potential response to MPB attack in the short-term suggests these forests are resistant to change early after attack, and/or have high ecological inertia. In contrast, salvage logging had immediate and dramatic effects. We don't yet know how these pine forests will develop under this modified disturbance regime of partial canopy disturbance, but it appears likely that salvage logging will push these stands in a potentially very different direction than the modified natural disturbance regime due to MPB will.",2013,10.1890/ES12-00344.1,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WOS:000327309300001,Adrienne,No,Yes,No,,,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Courtney,No,,No,Upper Foothills natural sub-region of Alberta,

Human activities and forest fires can also elevate phosphorus (P) deposition, possibly compounding the ecological effects of increased N deposition given the ubiquity of nutrient co-limitation of primary producers. Low N : P ratios coupled with evidence of NP-limitation from bioassays led us to hypothesize that P indirectly stimulates phytoplankton by amplifying the direct positive effect of N (i.e. serial N-limitation) in alpine ponds. We tested the hypothesis using the first replicated N x P enrichment experiment conducted at the whole-ecosystem level, which involved 12 alpine ponds located in the low N deposition backcountry of the eastern Front Range of the Canadian Rockies. Although applications of N and P elevated ambient N and P concentrations by 2-5x, seston and plankton remained relatively unaffected in the amended ponds. However, additions of ammonium nitrate elevated the delta N-15 signals of both primary producers and herbivores (fairy shrimp; Anostraca), attesting to trophic transfer of N deposition to consumers. Further, in situ bioassays revealed that grazing by high ambient densities of fairy shrimp together with potential competition from algae lining the pond bottoms suppressed the otherwise serially N-limited response by phytoplankton.

This input further attenuates the penetration of solar radiation, leading to the view that opaque lakes are more ""protected"" from solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR) than clear ones. Vertical mixing, however, complicates this view as cells are exposed to fluctuating radiation regimes, for which the effects have, in general, been neglected. Furthermore, the combined impacts of mixing, together with those of UVR and nutrient inputs are virtually unknown. In this study, we carried out complex in situ experiments in three high mountain lakes of Spain (Lake Enol in the National Park Picos de Europa, Asturias, and lakes Las Yeguas and La Caldera in the National Park Sierra Nevada, Granada), used as model ecosystems to evaluate the joint impact of these climate change variables. The main goal of this study was to address the question of how short-term pulses of nutrient inputs, together with vertical mixing and increased UVR fluxes modify the photosynthetic responses of phytoplankton. The experimentation consisted in all possible combinations of the following treatments: (a) solar radiation: UVR+ PAR (280-700 nm) versus PAR (photosynthetically active radiation) alone (400-700 nm); (b) nutrient addition (phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N)): ambient versus addition (P to reach to a final concentration of 30 mu g P L-1, and N to reach N: P molar ratio of 31); and (c) mixing: mixed (one rotation from surface to 3m depth (speed of 1 m 4 min(-1), total of 10 cycles)) versus static. Our findings suggest that under ambient nutrient conditions there is a synergistic effect between vertical mixing and UVR, increasing phytoplankton photosynthetic inhibition and excretion of organic carbon (EOC) from opaque lakes as compared to algae that received constant mean irradiance within the epilimnion. The opposite occurs in clear lakes where antagonistic effects were determined, with mixing partially counteracting the negative effects of UVR. Nutrient input, mimicking atmospheric pulses from Saharan dust, reversed this effect and clear lakes became more inhibited during mixing, while opaque lakes benefited from the fluctuating irradiance regime. These climate change related scenarios of nutrient input and increased mixing, would not only affect photosynthesis and production in lakes, but might also further influence the microbial loop and trophic interactions via enhanced EOC under fluctuating UVR exposure.",2013,10.5194/bg-10-1037-2013,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology,WOS:000315093000025,Becky,No,Yes,No,,"Spain, (some anthropogenic signifcance) CC impacts on input of material into water bodies",NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Courtney,No,,No,nothing in crb,

This study reports temporal variations in stable isotopic ratios and concentrations of major dissolved ions of streamwater and precipitation between October, 2005 and May, 2007 in Red Canyon Creek and its tributary, Cherry Creek, draining carbonate-rich catchments on the southeastern flank of Wind River Range (Wyoming, USA). Although the isotopic ratios of oxygen and hydrogen in precipitation increased from approximately -33 parts per thousand to -13 parts per thousand and -260 parts per thousand to -110 parts per thousand, respectively, during winters of 2006 and 2007. the oxygen and hydrogen isotopic compositions of streamwater at all sites remained unchanged throughout the year at -18.6 +/- 0.3 parts per thousand (n = 88) and -142 +/- 1.6 parts per thousand (n = 40) for delta O-18 and delta H-2, respectively. The isotopic values for the streamwater were identical to that found in groundwater, which had the values of -18.6 +/- 0.2 parts per thousand (n = 26) and -142 +/- 1.1 parts per thousand (n = 26) for delta O-18 and delta H-2, respectively. On the other hand, the temporal pattern of streamwater chemistry differed in space. In upper Red Canyon Creek, major dissolved ion concentrations in water varied little throughout the year. Nearly constant isotopic and chemical composition of streamwater at upper Red Canyon Creek indicated the dominance of the groundwater contribution throughout the year. In contrast, Cherry Creek had clear dilution of base metal and sulfate concentrations during increasing discharge at snowmelt, which is a clear indication of ""new"" water coming from fresh snowmelt. The contrasting behavior of stable isotopes and dissolved solutes during snowmelt at Cherry Creek suggests the isotopic tracers traditionally used in hydrograph separation failed to indicate different water sources at Cherry Creek. Combining isotopes and geochemical tracers indicates that streamwater at Cherry Creek during snowmelt is primarily a mixture of snowmelt and groundwater which have similar isotopic compositions but different chemical concentrations. The snowmelt is well mixed during temporary storage in a headwater wetland before reaching the sampling site. Such mixing plays an important role in reducing temporal variability of stable isotope values of fresh snowmelt water. We suggest that development of direct tracer experiments might help address the hydrodynamics of these kinds of watersheds in future research. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Our study focused on montane stonefly populations in the Great Basin of western North America. We used niche-based distribution modelling, phylogeography and traditional species-based biogeography to test several hypotheses as follows: (i) genetic differentiation among Doroneuria baumanni populations will be independent of hydrologic connectivity (headwater model); (ii) Sky islands were colonized when habitat was more continuous and populations likely experienced multiple expansions and contractions; (iii) Colonization events were coincident with the late Pleistocene and Holocene; and (iv) Shared topography and climate history will result in concordant patterns of genetic differentiation in D.similar to baumanni and occurrences of 32 stonefly species across the region. Overall, FSTs and coalescent-based estimates of migration were consistent with the headwater model. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian gene trees identified three major nonoverlapping east-west clades. Distribution modelling indicated more suitable habitat in the Great Basin during the Last Glacial Maximum than at present, but none during the last interglacial period. Demographic analyses showed evidence of population expansion in one of the three major eastwest clades. Intra-clade divergence times (60 000183 000 ybp) were well within the late Pleistocene while among-clade divergence times (499 000719 000 ybp) were deeper. Genetic differentiation in D.similar to baumanni and distributions of stonefly species were significantly concordant.

This large basin presents a unique modelling case due to its physiographic heterogeneity and the potentially large implications of changes to its hydrologic regime. The macro-scale Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrologic model was employed to simulate 30-year baseline (1970s) and future (2050s) hydrologic regimes based on climate forcings derived from eight global climate models (GCMs) runs under three emissions scenarios (B1, A1B and A2). Bias Corrected Spatial Disaggregation was used to statistically downscale GCM outputs to the resolution of the VIC model (1/16 degrees). The modelled future scenarios for the 11 sub-basins and three regions (eastern mountains, central plateau and coastal mountains) of the FRB exhibit spatially varied responses, such as, shifts from snow-dominant to hybrid regime in the eastern and coastal mountains and hybrid to rain-dominant regime in the central plateau region. The analysis of temporal changes illustrated considerable uncertainties in the projections obtained from an ensemble of GCMs and emission scenarios. However, direction of changes obtained from the GCM ensembles and emissions scenarios are consistent amongst one another. The most significant temporal changes could include earlier onsets of snowmelt-driven peak discharge, increased winter and spring runoff and decreased summer runoff. The projected winter runoff increases and summer decreases are more pronounced in the central plateau region. The results also revealed increases in the total annual discharge and decreases in the 30-year mean of the peak annual discharge. Such climate-induced changes could have implications for water resources management in the region. The spatially and temporally varied hydro-climatic projections and their range of projections can be used for local-scale adaptation in this important water resource system for British Columbia.

Among these models a warming trend is universal, but projected changes in precipitation vary in sign and magnitude. Two independent methods are applied: a dynamic global vegetation model to assess changes in plant functional types and bioclimatic envelope modeling to assess changes in individual tree and shrub species and biodiversity. The former approach investigates broad responses of plant functional types to climate change, while considering competition, disturbances, and carbon fertilization, while the latter approach focuses on the response of individual plant species, and net biodiversity, to climate change. The dynamic model simulates a region-wide reduction in vegetation cover during the 21st century, with a partial replacement of evergreen trees with grasses in the mountains of Colorado and Utah, except at the highest elevations, where tree cover increases. Across southern Arizona, central New Mexico, and eastern Colorado, grass cover declines, in some cases abruptly. Due to the prevalent warming trend among all 17 climate models, vegetation cover declines in the 21st century, with the greatest vegetation losses associated with models that project a drying trend. The inclusion of the carbon fertilization effect largely ameliorates the projected vegetation loss. Based on bioclimatic envelope modeling for the 21st century, the number of tree and shrub species that are expected to experience robust declines in range likely outweighs the number of species that are expected to expand in range. Dramatic shifts in plant species richness are projected, with declines in the high-elevation evergreen forests, increases in the eastern New Mexico prairies, and a northward shift of the Sonoran Desert biodiversity maximum.",2012,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WOS:000305836600024,Becky,No,Yes,No,,Southwest United States,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Courtney,No,,No,southwest,

Groundwater pumping from additional groundwater development in the form of new pumping wells starting in 1991 has significantly reduced the streamflow, especially during the summer. The fraction of gross rainfall converted into ET has significantly increased by 7% during 1991-2009 compared to the pre-development period. Based on the model results, in the absence of the groundwater development in the upper part of Makaha watershed, the observed cumulative streamflow could have been 11% higher than its current level. On an annual basis, total additional groundwater pumping accounts for 26% of the recharge with a significant seasonal variability (12% in wet and 180% in dry season). Relative to recharge, higher groundwater pumping during the dry season could have been the reason behind the significant streamflow decline during the summer. This study clearly emphasizes the importance of temporal patterns in groundwater withdrawal which are often ignored while determining safe yield. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We sampled MPB populations across British Columbia and Alberta and used phylogeographic methods to describe lineage diversification, characterize population structure, investigate expansion dynamics, and identify source populations of the outbreak. Using 1181 bp of mitochondrial DNA sequence from 267 individuals, we found high haplotype diversity, low nucleotide diversity, and limited lineage diversification. The overall pattern was consistent with isolation by distance at a continental scale, and with reduced diversity and population structure in the northerly, outbreak regions. Post-Pleistocene expansion was detected, however more recent expansion signals were not detected, potentially due to the size and rapid rate of range expansion. Based on the limited genetic structure, there were likely multiple source populations in southern British Columbia, although the magnitude of the demographic expansion and rate of spread have obscured the signature of these source populations.

Net photosynthesis declined strongly with leaf-to-air vapour pressure deficit, resulting in a bimodal seasonal pattern of A(max). Although very little gas exchange was observed in late summer, photosynthetic activity extended into October. The avoidance of gas exchange during high atmospheric demand maximized whole-season water-use efficiency. Leaf temperature and leaf-to-air vapour pressure deficit were higher on south-facing slopes during both moderate (2006) and severe (2007) drought.

Large-scale insect outbreaks provide an ideal system to examine the cascade of ecological effects of disturbance regimes across forested landscapes. A major outbreak of the mountain pine beetle Dendroctonus ponderosae continues to exert landscape-level mortality across forests of lodgepole pine Pinus contorta var. latifolia. in western Canada. This outbreak, exacerbated in part by fire suppression and climate change, has affected more than 14 million ha of merchantable forest. Salvage and reforestation efforts are currently underway at landscape-level scales. An emerging concern is the migration of Warren root collar weevil Hylobius warreni from stands with a reduced host pool, i.e. those with a high per cent of mature, dead lodgepole pine, into young, replanted stands, resulting in significant levels of mortality to juvenile trees. 2. The impact of Warren root collar weevil in stands of young trees (9-11 years of age) replanted after salvage harvesting was examined in nine cutblocks (areas delineated for commercial timber harvest, c. 1 km in diameter). All cutblocks, sampled across the central interior of British Columbia, were located next to unsalvaged, mature stands. 3. Field data and aerial surveys revealed higher tree mortality from Warren root collar weevils along cutblock perimeters adjacent to unsalvaged, mature stands. Mortality decreased with increasing distance from the edge of the cutblocks. Additional mortality along these gradients was associated with increasing per cent of pine in the mature stand; more-so if the pine was dead. Moreover, the gradient of mortality became more pronounced with time as mountain pine beetle had attacked the adjacent mature stands. Weevils attacked the largest trees within the replanted cutblocks. 4. These gradients of tree mortality suggest migration of Warren root collar weevils from unsalvaged mature stands into adjacent replanted forests most probably in search of food. 5. Synthesis and applications. This study demonstrates how a management response to a large insect outbreak, itself mediated by anthropogenic factors, can predispose reforested stands to additional, unanticipated threats from other insects. Reforestation strategies following outbreaks of mountain pine beetle may need to include harvesting larger salvage blocks to minimize edge effects and reduce mortality from Warren root collar weevils. Moreover, the inclusion of deciduous non-host tree stock in planting mixes might reduce insect movement and limit tree mortality because of Warren root collar weevils.",2010,10.1111/j.1365-2664.2010.01797.x,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WOS:000277168000008,Courtney,Yes,Yes,Yes,Landscape/State-Province,"Western Canada, pine beetle",NA,,,,,,Micah,No,Yes,No,Central BC,Courtney,No,Yes,No,"BC, out of basin",

At a landscape scale, these impacts, and biotic responses such as adaptation and migration, will be mediated by spatial heterogeneity in climate and climate change. We examine several aspects of the geography of climate change and their significance for biodiversity conservation. Location California and Nevada, USA. Methods Using current climate surfaces (PRISM) and two scenarios of future climate (A1b, 2070-2099, warmer-drier and warmer-wetter), we mapped disappearing, declining, expanding and novel climates, and the velocity and direction of climate change in California and Nevada. We also examined fine-scale spatial heterogeneity in protected areas of the San Francisco Bay Area in relation to reserve size, topographic complexity and distance from the ocean. Results Under the two climate change scenarios, current climates across most of California and Nevada will shrink greatly in extent, and the climates of the highest peaks will disappear from this region. Expanding and novel climates are projected for the Central Valley. Current temperature isoclines are projected to move up to 4.9 km year-1 in flatter regions, but substantially slower in mountainous areas because of steep local topoclimate gradients. In the San Francisco Bay Area, climate diversity within currently protected areas increases with reserve size and proximity to the ocean (the latter because of strong coastal climate gradients). However, by 2100 of almost 500 protected areas (> 100 ha), only eight of the largest are projected to experience temperatures within their currently observed range. Topoclimate variability will further increase the range of conditions experienced and needs to be incorporated in future analyses.

If the PDO's influence is not incorporated into a trend analysis of streamflows, it can produce detected declines that are actually artifacts of this low-frequency variability. Further difficulties arise from the short length and discontinuity of most gauge records, human impacts, and residual autocorrelation. We analyze southern Alberta and environs instrumental streamflow data, using void-filled datasets from unregulated and regulated gauges and naturalized records, and Generalized Least Squares regression to explicitly model the impacts of the PDO and other climate oscillations. We conclude that streamflows are declining at most gauges due to hydroclimatic changes (probably from global warming) and severe human impacts, which are of the same order of magnitude as the hydroclimate changes, if not greater.

In this paper, we describe fire and fuel extensions for the forest landscape simulation model, LANDIS-II, that allow dynamic interactions among fire, vegetation, climate, and landscape structure, and incorporate realistic fire characteristics (shapes, distributions, and effects) that can vary within and between fire events. We demonstrate the capabilities of the new extensions using two case study examples with very different ecosystem characteristics: a boreal forest system from central Labrador, Canada, and a mixed conifer system from the Sierra Nevada Mountains (California, USA). In Labrador, comparison between the more complex dynamic fire extension and a classic fire simulator based on a simple fire size distribution showed little difference in terms of mean fire rotation and potential severity, but cumulative burn patterns created by the dynamic fire extension were more heterogeneous due to feedback between fuel types and fire behavior. Simulations in the Sierra Nevada indicated that burn patterns were responsive to topographic features, fuel types, and an extreme weather scenario, although the magnitude of responses depended on elevation. In both study areas, simulated fire size and resulting fire rotation intervals were moderately sensitive to parameters controlling the curvilinear response between fire spread and weather, as well as to the assumptions underlying the correlation between weather conditions and fire duration. Potential fire severity was more variable within the Sierra Nevada landscape and also was more sensitive to the correlation between weather conditions and fire duration. The fire modeling approach described here should be applicable to questions related to climate change and disturbance interactions, particularly within locations characterized by steep topography, where temporally or spatially dynamic vegetation significantly influences spread rates, where fire severity is variable, and where multiple disturbance types of varying severities are common.

Fire episode frequency was low during the Lateglacial period but increased through the middle Holocene to a maximum frequency around 6500 cal. yr BP. During the late Holocene fire episode frequency generally declined except for noted peaks around 3000 cal. yr BP and 1000-800 cal. yr BP. These variations track major climatic and vegetation changes driven by millennial-timescale variation in the seasonal cycle of insolation and regional decadal- and centennial-scale variation in effective moisture in the mid and late Holocene in the Sierra Nevada. tire episode frequency during the Holocene in the Lake Tahoe Basin varied in response to decadal-, centennial-and millennial-scale climatic variability Current fire episode frequency on the west shore of lake Tahoe is at one of its lowest points in at least the last 14 000 years.

Some rivers may provide a more complete record of Holocene climate change than the glaciers in their headwaters. We illustrate these points by examining the record preserved in the upper part of the alluvial fill in the Nostetuko River valley in the southern Coast Mountains, British Columbia (Canada). Glacier advances in the upper part of the watershed triggered valley-wide aggradation and complex changes in river planform. Periods when glaciers were restricted in extent coincide with periods of incision of the valley fill and floodplain stability. As many as 10 overbank aggradation units are separated by peat layers containing tree roots and stems in growth position. Twenty-five radiocarbon ages on roots, tree stems and woody plant detritus in several of the peat layers closely delimit periods of aggradation. The oldest phase of aggradation occurred about 6500 years BP and coincides with the Garibaldi Advance documented elsewhere in the southern Coast Mountains. A second phase of aggradation, recorded by several units of clastic sediment, dates to about 2500 years BP, near the peak of the middle Neoglacial Tiedemann Advance. The third phase occurred shortly after 1400 years BP during or shortly after the First Millennium Advance, which has been recently documented in coastal British Columbia and Alaska. The most recent phase of aggradation began about 800 years BP and continued until recently. It coincides with the Little Ice Age, when glaciers in the Nostetuko River basin and elsewhere in the southern Coast Mountains attained their greatest Holocene size. Several periods of peat deposition during the Little Ice Age indicate periods of floodplain stability separated by brief intervals of floodplain aggradation that coincide with Little Ice Age glacier advances in western Canada.

Compilations of fossil evidence have provided the best evidence of past plant range shifts, especially in eastern North America and Europe, and provide a context for interpreting new molecular datasets from modern forests. In western North America, however, such reviews have lagged even for common, widespread taxa. Here, we synthesize fossil evidence for Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) from nearly 550 fossil pollen, sedimentary macrofossil, and packrat midden macrofossil sites to develop hypotheses about the species' late Quaternary history that can be tested with molecular phylogeographic studies. For both the coastal and interior varieties, we identified alternative hypotheses on the number of glacial populations and postglacial migration patterns that can be characterized as single-population versus multiple-population hypotheses. Coastal Douglas-fir may have been subdivided into two populations at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and colonized British Columbia from populations in Washington and Oregon. Interior Douglas-fir could have been subdivided along major topographic barriers into at least three LGM populations and colonized British Columbia and Alberta from populations in northwest Wyoming and/or northeast Utah. For both varieties, we calculated migration rates lower than previous studies, which could have been as high as 100-220 m/yr if Douglas-fir reached its modern distribution 9000 cal yr BP, or as low as 50 m/yr if it reached its modern range at present. The elevational range of populations in California and the southern Rockies shifted upslope by 700-1000 m. If there were multiple LGM populations, these elevational shifts suggest that those populations did not contribute to the colonization of Canada. Our findings emphasize the possibility of low-density northern LGM populations and that populations within species react individualistically in response to large-scale climate change.

To determine the vegetation and fire history during the LGIT, and possible explanations for occupation during a period thought to be harsher than today, a 17-ka-old sediment core from Lily Pond (3208 m elev.) was analyzed for pollen and charcoal and compared with other high-resolution records from the southern Rocky Mountains. Widespread tundra and Picea parkland and low fire activity in the cold wet late-glacial period transitioned to open subalpine forest and increased fire activity in the Belling-Allerod period as conditions became warmer and drier. During the YDC, greater winter snowpack than today and prolonged wet springs likely expanded subalpine forest to lower elevations than today, providing construction material and fuel for the early inhabitants.

An important question facing the state-in terms of protecting the public and formulating water management responses to climate change-is ""how might future climate changes affect flood characteristics in California?"" To help address this, we simulate floods on the western slopes of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, the state's primary catchment, based on downscaled daily precipitation and temperature projections from three General Circulation Models (GCMs). These climate projections are fed into the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrologic model, and the VIC-simulated streamflows and hydrologic conditions, from historical and from projected climate change runs, allow us to evaluate possible changes in annual maximum 3-day flood magnitudes and frequencies of floods. By the end of the 21st Century, all projections yield larger-than-historical floods, for both the Northern Sierra Nevada (NSN) and for the Southern Sierra Nevada (SSN). The increases in flood magnitude are statistically significant (at p <= 0.01) for all the three GCMs in the period 2051-2099. The frequency of flood events above selected historical thresholds also increases under projections from CNRM CM3 and NCAR PCM1 climate models, while under the third scenario, GFDL CM2.1, frequencies remain constant or decline slightly, owing to an overall drying trend. These increases appear to derive jointly from increases in heavy precipitation amount, storm frequencies, and days with more precipitation falling as rain and less as snow. Increases in antecedent winter soil moisture also play a role in some areas.

The relative timing of mountain glacier maxima and the well-studied Lake Bonneville highstand has been unclear, however, owing to poor chronological limits on glacial deposits. Here, this problem is addressed by applying terrestrial cosmogenic Be-10 exposure dating to a classic set of terminal moraines in Little Cottonwood and American Fork Canyons in the western Wasatch Mountains. The exposure ages indicate that the main phase of deglaciation began at 15.7 +/- 1.3 ka in both canyons. This update to the glacial chronology of the western Wasatch Mountains can be reconciled with previous stratigraphic observations of glacial and paleolake deposits in this area, and indicates that the start of deglaciation occurred during or at the end of the Lake Bonneville hydrologic maximum. The glacial chronology reported here is consistent with the growing body of data suggesting that mountain glaciers in the western U.S. began retreating as many as 4 ka after the start of northern hemisphere deglaciation (at ca. 19 ka).

The enhanced hydrological cycle is also expected to increase snowfall amounts due to increased moisture availability. These processes are examined in this paper in the Colorado Headwaters region through the use of a coupled high-resolution climate-runoff model. Four high-resolution simulations of annual snowfall over Colorado are conducted. The simulations are verified using Snowpack Telemetry (SNOTEL) data. Results are then presented regarding the grid spacing needed for appropriate simulation of snowfall. Finally, climate sensitivity is explored using a pseudo-global warming approach. The results show that the proper spatial and temporal depiction of snowfall adequate for water resource and climate change purposes can be achieved with the appropriate choice of model grid spacing and parameterizations. The pseudo-global warming simulations indicate enhanced snowfall on the order of 10%-25% over the Colorado Headwaters region, with the enhancement being less in the core headwaters region due to the topographic reduction of precipitation upstream of the region (rain-shadow effect). The main climate change impacts are in the enhanced melting at the lower-elevation bound of the snowpack and the increased snowfall at higher elevations. The changes in peak snow mass are generally near zero due to these two compensating effects, and simulated wintertime total runoff is above current levels.

The influence of global climate change on stable isotope paleoaltimetry is uncertain, with proposals that warming could cause either overestimates or underestimates of past surface elevations. In this study we increase atmospheric pCO(2) by two and four times in an isotope-tracking atmospheric general circulation model to investigate the effect of global warming on oxygen isotopic compositions of precipitation (delta O-18(p)) over the continents. As in other climate models, the response in the GENESIS version 3 model to global warming is an amplification of upper troposphere temperatures through enhanced infrared absorption and a reduction in the surface to upper-level temperature gradient. Due to the temperature dependence of isotopic fractionation, vapor delta O-18 (delta O-18(v)) follows suit, leading to a reduction in the surface to upper troposphere delta O-18(v) gradient. In regions of subsidence, including the major orogens and deserts, downward mixing of O-18-enriched vapor from the troposphere to the near surface further reduces the lapse rate of delta O-18(v). As a consequence of these effects, the isotopic composition of precipitation in high-elevation regions, including the Tibetan Plateau, Rocky Mountains, European Alps, and Andean Plateau, increases by 3%-6% relative to that at low elevations. Neglect of this climate effect on high-elevation delta O-18(p) has likely led to underestimates of the surface elevation of Cenozoic orogens.",2011,10.1130/G32052.1,Geology,WOS:000291096300021,Danny,No,Yes,No,Landscape/State-Province,Colorado,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Courtney,No,,No,Big Mtn Ranges globally,

A critical assumption for projecting climate change responses is that SDMs are transferable through time, an assumption that is largely untested because investigators often lack temporally independent data for assessing transferability. Further, understanding how the ecology of species influences temporal transferability is critical yet almost wholly lacking. This raises two questions. (1) Are SDM projections transferable in time? (2) Does temporal transferability relate to species ecological traits? To address these questions we developed SDMs for 133 vascular plant species using data from the mountain ranges of California (USA) from two time periods: the 1930s and the present day. We forecast historical models over 75 years of measured climate change and assessed their projections against current distributions. Similarly, we hindcast contemporary models and compared their projections to historical data. We quantified transferability and related it to species ecological traits including physiognomy, endemism, dispersal capacity, fire adaptation, and commonness. We found that non-endemic species with greater dispersal capacity, intermediate levels of prevalence, and little fire adaptation had higher transferability than endemic species with limited dispersal capacity that rely on fire for reproduction. We demonstrate that variability in model performance was driven principally by differences among species as compared to model algorithms or time period of model calibration. Further, our results suggest that the traits correlated with prediction accuracy in a single time period may not be related to transferability between time periods. Our findings provide a priori guidance for the suitability of SDM as an approach for forecasting climate change responses for certain taxa.",NA,,,,Danny,No,Yes,No,Landscape/State-Province,SoCal,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Courtney,No,,No,CA,

Hydrologic responses to Pleistocene climate change within a deep vadose zone in the eastern Mojave Desert at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, were evaluated by uranium-series dating of finely layered hyalitic opal using secondary ion mass spectrometry. Opal is present within cm-thick secondary hydrogenic mineral crusts coating floors of lithophysal cavities in fractured volcanic rocks at depths of 200 to 300 m below land surface. Uranium concentrations in opal fluctuate systematically between 5 and 550 mu g/g. Age-calibrated profiles of uranium concentration correlate with regional climate records over the last 300,000 years and produce time-series spectral peaks that have distinct periodicities of 100- and 41-ka, consistent with planetary orbital parameters. These results indicate that the chemical compositions of percolating solutions varied in response to near-surface, climate-driven processes. However, slow (micrometers per thousand years), relatively uniform growth rates of secondary opal and calcite deposition spanning several glacial-interglacial climate cycles imply that water fluxes in the deep vadose zone remained low and generally buffered from the large fluctuations in available surface moisture during different climates.

Hosts may evolve defences that make them less susceptible and suitable to herbivores impacting their fitness. Due to climate change-driven range expansion, herbivores are encountering naive host populations with increasing frequency. 2. Aggressive bark beetles are among the most important agents of disturbance in coniferous forest ecosystems. The presence of bark beetle outbreaks in areas with a historically unsuitable climate, in part a consequence of climate change, provided an opportunity to assess the hypothesis that the mountain pine beetle Dendroctonus ponderosae has higher reproductive success in lodgepole pine Pinus contorta trees growing in areas that have not previously experienced frequent outbreaks. 3. We felled and sampled mountain pine beetle-killed trees from historically climatically suitable and unsuitable areas, i.e. areas with and without a historical probability of frequent outbreaks. Reproductive success was determined from a total of 166 trees from 14 stands. 4. Brood productivity was significantly affected by climatic suitability class, such that mean brood production per female increased as historical climatic suitability decreased. 5. Synthesis and applications. The current study demonstrates that the mountain pine beetle has higher reproductive success in areas where its host trees have not experienced frequent beetle epidemics, which includes much of the current outbreak area in north central British Columbia. This increased productivity of mountain pine beetle is likely to have been a key reason for the rapid population buildup that resulted in unprecedented host tree mortality over huge areas in western Canada. The outbreak thus provides an example of how climate change-driven range expansion of native forest insects can have potentially disastrous consequences. Since an increased reproductive success is likely to accelerate the progression of outbreaks, it is particularly critical to manage forests for the maintenance of a mosaic of species and age classes at the landscape level in areas where host tree populations are naive to eruptive herbivores.",2010,10.1111/j.1365-2664.2010.01848.x,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WOS:000281286800009,Danny,No,Yes,No,Ecosystem/Municipal,North Central BC,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Courtney,No,,No,North Central BC,

The spits are connected to small mountain ranges and islands, vary in size from 0.02 to 0.5 km(2), and are composed of coarse-grained, well-rounded, poorly-sorted sedimentary material. Sixteen of the 17 spits have a northeasterly to southwesterly orientation implying that winds were from the northwest to northeast, approximately 180 degrees out of phase with modem winds in the eastern Great Basin. Lake Bonneville spit orientation is best explained as the result of persistent northerly winds caused by the high atmospheric pressure cell of the continental ice sheet and passage of low pressure extratropical storms south of the lake. Similar, strong persistent winds are a common feature of modem continental ice sheets and passing low pressure systems.

The P fractions include mineral P (the original source of bioavailable P), occluded P (bound to soil oxides), and organic P (remains of organic matter). By comparing P fractions of soil and recent lake sediment samples, these fractions are shown to be a valid proxy for landscape-scale nutrient status. Changes in soil development for an alpine watershed (Lower Joffre Lake) are inferred from the P fractions in the basin's outlet lake sediments. Glacially sourced mineral P dominates at the base of the core, but several rapid shifts in P geochemistry are evident in the first similar to 3000 yr of the record. The latter indicates an interval of early and rapid soil nutrient maturation from similar to 9600 to 8500 cal yr BP and a significant influx of slope-derived material into Lower Joffre Lake. A substantial increase in mineral P occurs at ca. 8200 cal yr BP, consistent with the cold event in the vicinity of the North Atlantic at that time. The more recent record reveals a continual increase in the proportion of mineral P from glacial sources to the lake, indicating a trend toward cooler conditions in the Coast Mountains.

The authors used climate models to project changes in climate and precipitation in the Rocky Mountains and Front Range region in Colorado through the 2050s. Temperatures are likely to rise in this century. How this increase will affect precipitation is uncertain, and climate models do not agree on whether total precipitation will rise or fall. However, a rise in temperatures will mean earlier runoff, more evaporation from reservoirs, and higher demand for water in the summer. To maintain current soil moisture and water levels, an increase in precipitation will likely be needed to offset higher temperatures. Water managers in the Rocky Mountain region are becoming more concerned about climate change and its effect on water supply and demand. The analysis presented here can assist water managers in their long-term planning efforts and help ensure that those efforts consider not only population and economic factors but also the implications of climate change.-MPM",2006,,Engineering; Water Resources,WOS:000238439500016,Meghan,No,Yes,No,,Rocky mountians just east of the Snake River headwaters,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Courtney,No,,No,front range CO,

Radiocarbon-dated lake sediments from Lake CF3, northeastern Baffin Island, Arctic Canada, are used to reconstruct past environmental conditions over the last 11,200 years. Numerous proxies, including chironomid-inferred July air temperatures, diatom-inferred lakewater pH, and sediment organic matter, reveal a pronounced Holocene thermal maximum as much as 5 degrees C warmer than historic summer temperatures from similar to 10,000 to 8500 cal yr B.P. Following rapid cooling similar to 8500 cal yr B.P., Lake CF3 proxies indicate cooling through the late Holocene. At many sites in northeastern Canada, the Holocene thermal maximum occurred later than at Lake CF3; this late onset of Holocene warmth is generally attributed to the impacts of the decaying Laurentide Ice Sheet on early Holocene temperatures in northeastern Canada. However, the lacustrine proxies in Lake CF3 apparently responded to insolation-driven warnith, despite the proximity of Lake CF3 to the Laurentide Ice Sheet and its meltwater. The magnitude and timing of the Holocene thermal maximum at Lake CF3 indicate that temperatures and environmental conditions at this site are highly sensitive to changes in radiative forcing.

Currently, N concentrations in forest waters are usually well below water quality standards. But elevated concentrations are frequently found in regions with chronic N input from deposition (> 8-10 kg ha(-1) a(-1)). We synthesized the current understanding of factors controlling N leaching in relation to three primary causes of N cycle disruption: (i) Increased N input (air pollution, fertilization, N-2 fixing plants). In European forests, elevated N deposition explains approximately half of the variability in N leaching, some of the remaining variability could be explained by differences in N availability or ""N status"". For coniferous forests, needle N content above 1.4% and (or) forest floor C:N ratio lower than 25 were thresholds for elevated nitrate leaching. At adjacent sites conifer forests receive higher N deposition and exhibit higher nitrate loss than deciduous forests; an exception is alder that shows substantial nitrate leaching through N fixation input. Fertilization with N poses limited risk to water quality, when applied to N-limited forests. (ii) Reduced plant uptake (clear-cut, thinning, weed control). The N cycle responses to plant cover disturbance by clear-cut are well studied. Nitrate losses peak after 2-3 years and are back to pre-cut levels after 3-5 years. Nitrogen losses increase with deposition and are higher at N rich sites. The extent and duration of the nitrate response is especially connected to the recovery of the vegetation sink. Less intensive disturbances like thinning have only minor effects on N loss. (iii) Enhanced mineralization of soil N (liming, ditching, climate change). Responses in nitrate leaching after liming may increase with N deposition and in older stands. However data on these types of N cycle disruption are too sparse to allow general conclusions on controlling factors. Nitrate leaching occurs when N deposition (input) and net mineralization (N status) exceed plant demand. A combined N flux to the soil of 50 to 60 kg ha(-1) a(-1) from N deposition and litterfall may be a threshold for nitrate leaching in undisturbed forests. This threshold also indicates risk of increasing losses in case of a disturbance (e.g., clear-cut). We conclude by discussing forest management options for water quality protection. These options focus on decreasing input, increasing plant uptake, increasing biomass removal, and (re)establishing immobilization and denitrification processes at the catchment scale.",2006,10.1139/A05-015,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WOS:000238178500001,Meghan,No,Yes,No,,,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Courtney,No,,No,Overview of a concept about nitrogen,

P enrichment suppressed or attenuated the negative effects exerted by ultraviolet radiation on algae when their elemental composition was P deficient. This was reflected in antagonistic interactive effects between P enrichment and solar radiation (P X R), which were triggered by a decrease in primary production and an increase in organic carbon excretion due to metabolic adjustments to growth. P enrichment also suppressed or attenuated the main effects exerted by ultraviolet radiation on bacteria. This was reflected in antagonistic P X R interactive effects triggered by an enhancement of the dual control (resource and predation) that algae exerted on bacteria and by the growth stimulation of P-deficient bacteria after P enrichment.

We focus on the modern, more dissected topography of these ranges, reflecting late Cenozoic evolution driven by fluvial and glacial exhumation, each of which affects different portions of the landscape in characteristic ways. Ongoing exhumation of the adjacent basins, in places by more than 1 km, is effectively lowering base level of streams draining the crystalline range cores. The streams have incised deep bedrock canyons that now cut the flanks of the range. Over the same time scales, glaciation of the headwaters of the major streams has modified the range crests. We utilize the topography of the northern Front Range of Colorado to explore the response of a Laramide range both to the exhumation of the adjacent basin and to glaciation in the high elevations. We break the problem of whole landscape evolution into three related, one-dimensional problems: evolution of the high smooth summit surfaces; evolution of the longitudinal profiles of adjacent glacial troughs; and evolution of the fluvial profiles downstream of the glacial limit. We review work on the high summit surfaces, showing quantitatively that they are steady-state features lowering at rates on the order of 5 mu m/yr, and are entirely decoupled from the adjacent glacial troughs. Glaciers not only truncate these high surfaces, but greatly alter the longitudinal profiles of the major streams: major steps occur at tributary junctions, and profiles above the glacial limit are significantly flattened from their original fluvial slopes. We extend existing models of glacial valley evolution by including processes that allow head-wall retreat. This serves to enhance the headward retreat of east-facing valleys, and explains the asymmetric truncation of the high smooth surfaces that form the spine of the range. Fluvial profiles downstream of the glacial limit commonly display a prominent convexity inboard of the range edge. Stream-power-based numerical models of profile evolution of specific rivers demonstrate that this reflects a transient response of the streams to base-level lowering. This response varies significantly with drainage basin area. We explore the degree to which this differential response controls thelocation of major remnants of pediments on the edge of the Great Plains, such as the prominent Rocky Flats and adjacent surfaces.",2006,10.1130/2006.2398(25),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology,WOS:000271216300026,Meghan,No,Yes,No,,paleoclimate,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Courtney,No,,No,Southern Rockies,

The majority of peatlands surveyed were wooded, relatively small (mean = 1.8 ha), and in depressions on the landscape. A classification and indicator species analysis identified the dominant peatland types as moderate-rich fens, with bogs and extreme-rich fens as rare. Black spruce swamps were relatively common and often found on gentle slopes. They were distinguished from wooded fens by larger trees (mean height = 9.7 m; diameter = 12.6 cm), denser overstory (68%), shallower peat depth (90 cm), and small size (1.6 ha). Although most similar to wooded moderate-rich fens by vegetation, black spruce swamps have a denser bryophyte layer and more mesic plant species. Significant indicator species on hummocks and drier areas include Pleurozium schreberi, Hylocomium splendens, Equisetum sylvaticum, Petasites frigidus var. palmatus, Comus canadensis, Linnaea borealis, Rosa acicularis, Moneses uniflora, Geocaulon lividum, Orthillia secunda, Equisetum arvense, Listera cordata, and Mertensia paniculata. Species characteristically found in black spruce swamp hollows include Rhizomnium pseudopunctatum, Rhizomnium gracile, and Plagiochila porelloides. We discuss conifer swamp terminology globally, and recommend that black spruce swamps be recognized as a peatland type distinct from eastern white cedar-dominated boreal swamps found in the eastern boreal region, wooded fens, and black spruce-dominated uplands. The environmental gradients most strongly associated with an ordination of the Duck Mountain peatland plant community data were forest mensuration variables, e.g., overstory density (range = 7-80%), peat depth (0.4-+3.0 m), peat C:N (14-67), organic C (54-98%), bulk density (0.19-64.00 g/cc), surface-water temperature (3.0-19.5 degrees C), specific conductivity (0-989 mu S/cm), and Ca2+ (1.8-111.4 mg/L). Wooded bogs were distinguished from the other peatland types based on mean pH (3.8), alkalinity (0.2 mg/L), Ca2+ (5.0 mg/L) and other cations, but there was much overlap among the fens and black spruce swamp. A number of isolated, topographically high, open peatlands were characterized by plant species with affinities to open moderate-rich fens, including Drepanocladus aduncus, Helodium blandowii, Salix discolor, Equisetum fluviatile, and Calamagrostis canadensis, but mean surface water pH (5.4), Ca2+ (13 mg/L), DOC (47 mg/L), and NH4+ (188 mu g/L) were more similar to wooded bogs. This may be the consequence of fluctuating water levels. The potential impact of climate change, in addition to current impacts from logging, emphasizes the importance of understanding the vegetation and environmental variables in southern boreal peatlands.",2005,10.1672/0277-5212(2005)025[0564:TVEOBS]2.0.CO;2,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WOS:000232130300006,Meghan,No,Maybe,No,,,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Courtney,No,,No,Duck Mtn Manitoba,

These disappearances may represent a natural extinction-recolonization dynamic, but a more alarming possibility is a recent die-off linked to climate change, which is predicted to force montane vegetation zones further upslope, shrinking the habitat of associated faunas, However, marmots in this study were observed as low as 1550 m elevation, indicating an altitudinal flexibility that may allow this species to survive climatic change better than more specialized boreal species such as pikas (Ochotona princeps) and water shrews (Sorex palustris).",2004,,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WOS:000224952700007,Meghan,Maybe,Yes,No,Landscape/State-Province,"Just south of the snake river basin, but in mountains shared by the great basin",NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Courtney,No,,No,Great Basin,

Two potential pathways of spread to eastern forests have recently been identified. First, warming temperatures have driven range expansion from British Columbia into Albertan jack pine forests that are contiguous with the Great Lakes region. Second, high temperatures and drought have fostered largescale outbreaks within the historical range, creating economic incentives to salvage killed timber by transporting logs to midwestern markets, which risks accidental introduction. We evaluated the extent to which local predators and competitors that exploit bark beetle semiochemicals would respond to D. ponderosae in Wisconsin. We emulated D. ponderosae attack by deploying lures containing synthetic aggregation pheromones with and without host tree compounds and blank control traps in six red pine plantations over 2 yr. Predator populations were high in these stands, as evidenced by catches in positive control traps, baited with pheromones of local bark beetles and were deployed distant from behavioral choice plots. Only one predator, Thanasimus dubius F. (Coleoptera: Cleridae) was attracted to D. ponderosae's aggregation pheromones relative to blank controls, and its attraction was relatively weak. The most common bark beetles attracted to these pheromones were lower stem and root colonizers, which likely would facilitate rather than compete with D. ponderosae. There was some, but weak, attraction of potentially competing Ips species.

This is particularly true in portions of the western United States where tribal hunter-gatherers did not use agriculture to meet subsistence and other cultural needs. Climate has been viewed as the dominant determinant of vegetation structure and composition change over time, but ethnographic and anthropological evidence suggests that Native American land-use practices (particularly through the use of fire) had significant landscape effects on vegetation. However, it is difficult to distinguish climatically driven vegetation change from human-caused vegetation change using traditional paleoecological methods. To address this problem, we use a multidisciplinary methodology that incorporates paleoecology with local ethnographic and archaeological information at two lake sites in northwestern California. We show that anthropogenic impacts can be distinguished at our Fish Lake site during the cool and wet Little Ice Age', when we have evidence for open-forest or shade-intolerant vegetation, fostered for subsistence and cultural purposes, rather than the closed-forest or shade-tolerant vegetation expected due to the climatic shift. We also see a strong anthropogenic influence on modern vegetation at both sites following European settlement, decline in tribal use, and subsequent fire exclusion. These results demonstrate that Native American influences on vegetation structure and composition can be distinguished using methods that take into account both physical and cultural aspects of the landscape.

Little research has examined the long-term and broad-scale history of MPB outbreaks, which is necessary to provide a baseline for comparing current and future outbreak extents. We examine the long-term history of MPB outbreaks in western Colorado, and analyse the synchrony of previous outbreaks across western North America. LocationWestern Colorado for tree-ring analysis; western North America for comparative analysis. MethodsWe used dendroecological methods to reconstruct the history of MPB outbreaks since the 1700s in lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) forests in Colorado. We then combined these new records with previously published data on MPB outbreaks to examine the historical synchrony of outbreaks across western North America. ResultsThe tree-ring record indicated that multiple cross-site MPB outbreaks occurred in Colorado lodgepole pine forests, initiating c. 1760s, 1780s, 1820s-1830s, 1860s, 1910s, 1960s and 1980s. Comparative analysis indicated that these outbreak dates coincide with documented and reconstructed MPB outbreaks in British Columbia, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming and Utah. Main conclusionsSeveral subcontinental-scale MPB outbreaks have occurred in lodgepole pine forests over the past three centuries. Although the current study does not address the intensity of past outbreaks, it does indicate that previous outbreaks appear to have been highly synchronous across western North America. The subcontinental, rather than purely local, nature of these outbreaks is important for putting recent and future outbreaks of MPB into a broader ecological context.

As a step towards addressing this problem, we present a cosmogenicl Be-10 surface-exposure chronology from the Androscoggin moraine complex, located in the White Mountains of western Maine and northern New Hampshire, as well as four recalculated ages from the nearby Littleton-Bethlehem moraine. Seven internally consistent Be-10 ages from the Androscoggin terminal moraines indicate that advance culminated similar to 13.2 +/- 0.8 ka, in close agreement with the mean age of the neighboring Littleton-Bethlehem complex.

Unfortunately, chronicling fault slip with techniques like thermochronology and geodetics can still leave sizable, yet potentially important gaps at Pliocene-Quaternary (similar to 10(5)-10(6) yr) time scales. Here, we combine existing geochronology with new geomorphic observations and approaches to investigate the Miocene to Quaternary slip history of active normal faults that are exhuming three footwall ranges in northwestern Nevada: the Pine Forest Range, the Jackson Mountains, and the Santa Rosa Range. We use the National Elevation Dataset (10 m) digital elevation model (DEM) to measure bedrock river profiles and hillslope gradients from these ranges. We observe a prominent suite of channel convexities (knickpoints) that segment the channels into upper reaches with low steepness (mean k(sn) = similar to 182; theta(ref) = 0.51) and lower, fault-proximal reaches with high steepness (mean k(sn) = similar to 361), with a concomitant increase in hillslope angles of similar to 6 degrees-9 degrees. Geologic maps and field-based proxies for rock strength allow us to rule out static causes for the knickpoints and interpret them as transient features triggered by a drop in base level that created similar to 20% of the existing relief (similar to 220 m of similar to 1050 m total). We then constrain the timing of base-level change using paleochannel profile reconstructions, catchment-scale volumetric erosion fluxes, and a stream-power-based knickpoint celerity (migration) model. Low-temperature thermochronology data show that faulting began at ca. 11-12 Ma, yet our results estimate knickpoint initiation began in the last 5 Ma and possibly as recently as 0.1 Ma with reasonable migration rates of 0.5-2 mm/yr. We interpret the collective results to be evidence for enhanced Pliocene-Quaternary fault slip that may be related to tectonic reorganization in the American West, although we cannot rule out climate as a contributing mechanism. We propose that similar studies, which remain remarkably rare across the region, be used to further test how robust this Plio-Quaternary landscape signal may be throughout the Great Basin.",2015,10.1130/L401.1,Geochemistry & Geophysics; Geology,WOS:000351916600006,Micah,No,No,No,,NV,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Courtney,No,,No,Nevada,

The longfin dace (Agosia chrysogaster) is endemic to the Gila River basin of the southwestern USA and northern Mexico and occupies a range of thermal environments from cool mountain tributaries to warm desert rivers but information about its thermal biology is limited, particularly for larvae. We quantified the effect of rearing temperature on survival, growth capacity, and critical thermal maximum (CTM) of larval longfin dace. Broodstocks of longfin dace were collected from two sites in the upper Gila River in New Mexico from which larvae were hatched and reared for 22 days in indoor aquaria at constant temperatures ranging from 18.0 to 31.0 A degrees C. Growth capacity peaked at 27.0 A degrees C and was 21 % greater for larvae hatched from the upstream compared to the downstream broodstock, indicating intraspecific variability in growth capacity. CTM increased with rearing temperature and ranged from 33.9 to 39.9 A degrees C, indicating that thermal acclimation influences maximum thermal tolerance. CTM and acclimation response ratio of larvae are lower than those of adult longfin dace measured in a previous study, suggesting that larvae are more sensitive and less responsive to thermal stress than adults. Water temperatures in 2012 from six sites in the upper Gila River basin did not exceed 27.0 A degrees C and larval growth capacities in May of 2012 ranged from 5 to 28 % of the maximum growth capacity.

Particulates act as vehicles for long range transport of organic pollutants, depositing at locations far from their source. Nonylphenol, a biodegradation product of nonylphenol polyethoxylate, is a known endocrine disruptor. Nonylphenol polyethoxylate enters the environment as an inert ingredient in pesticide sprays, potentially traveling great distances from its application site. This is of concern when a highly agricultural region, California's Central Valley, lies adjacent to sensitive areas like the Eastern Sierra Nevada Mountains. The distribution and transport mechanisms for 4-nonylphenol were investigated in Eastern Sierra Nevada canyons. Regions close to canyon headwalls showed trace amounts of 4-nonylphenol in surface water, snow, and atmospheric deposition. Exposed areas had yearly average concentrations as high as 9 mu g/L. Distribution patterns are consistent with particulate-bound transport. This suggests with increasing drought periods, higher levels of persistent organic pollutants are likely. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The midge stratigraphy spans similar to 140-77 ka, which includes the end of Marine Oxygen Isotope Stage (MIS) 6 and all of MIS 5. Notable shifts in midge assemblages occurred during two discrete intervals: the transition from MIS 6 to MIS 5e and midway through MIS 5a. A regional calibration set, incorporating lakes from the Colorado Rockies, Sierra Nevada, and Uinta Mountains, was used to develop a midge-based mean July air temperature (MJAT) inference model (r(jack)(2) = 0.61, RMSEP = 0.97 degrees C). Model results indicate that the transition from MIS 6 to MIS 5e at the ZRFS was characterized by an increase in MJAT from similar to 9.0 to 10.5 degrees C. The results also indicate that temperatures gradually increased through MIS 5 before reaching a maximum of 13.3 degrees C during MIS 5a. This study represents the first set of quantitative, midge-based MJAT estimates in the continental U.S. that spans the entirety of MIS 5. Overall, our results suggest that conditions in the Colorado Rockies throughout MIS 5 were cooler than today, as the upper limit of the reconstructed temperatures is similar to 2 degrees C below modem July air temperatures.

LU change affected stream T primarily in headwater streams, on average up to 2.1 degrees C over short durations, and projected CC affected stream T, on average 2.1-3.3 degrees C by 2060. Daily mean flow and T ratios from Monte Carlo simulations indicated greater variance in the response of streamflow (up to 55%) to LU change than in the response of stream T (up to 9%), and greater variance in headwater stream segments compared to higher order stream segments for both streamflow and T response.

Concurrently, they risk the loss of reproductive efforts to late frosts. Quantifying long-term trends in northeastern alpine flower phenology and late-spring/early-summer frost risk is limited by a dearth of phenology and climate data, except for Mount Washington, New Hampshire (1916 m a.s.l.). Methods: Logistic phenology models for three northeastern US alpine species (Diapensia lapponica, Carex bigelowii and Vaccinium vitis-idaea) were developed from 4 yr (2008-2011) of phenology and air temperature measurements from 12 plots proximate to Mount Washington's long-term summit meteorological station. Plot-level air temperature, the logistic phenology models, and Mount Washington's climate data were used to hindcast model yearly (1935-2011) floral phenology and frost damage risk for the focal species. Key results: Day of year and air growing degree-days with threshold temperatures of -4 degrees C (D. lapponica and C. bigelowii) and -2 degrees C (V. vitis-idaea) best predicted flowering. Modeled historic flowering dates trended significantly earlier but the 77-yr change was small (1.2-2.1 d) and did not significantly increase early-flowering risk from late-spring/early-summer frost damage. Conclusions: Modeled trends in phenological advancement and sensitivity for three northeastern alpine species are less pronounced compared with lower elevations in the region, and this small shift in flower timing did not increase risk of frost damage. Potential reasons for limited earlier phenological advancement at higher elevations include a slower warming trend and increased cloud exposure with elevation and/or inadequate chilling requirements.",2014,10.3732/ajb.1400214,Plant Sciences,WOS:000342536100005,Micah,No,Yes,No,,NE US,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Courtney,No,,No,NE US,

The objectives of this review are: (1) to characterize the likely short- and longer-term effects of projected climate changes on fuel dynamics and fire regimes for four generalized forest types in the Rocky Mountain region; (2) to review how these changes are likely to affect carbon sequestration, water resources, air quality, and biodiversity; and (3) to assess the suitability of four different management alternatives to mitigate these effects and maintain forest ecosystem services. Current climate projections indicate that temperatures will increase in every season; forecasts for precipitation are less certain but suggest that the northern part of the region but not the southern part will experience higher annual precipitation. The increase in temperatures will result in a greater proportion of winter precipitation falling as rain, earlier spring snowmelt, and a consequential increase in the length and severity of fire seasons. Fire frequency is likely to increase in the short term in all areas because of the warmer, longer, and drier fire seasons, but this change is likely to lead to a longer-term reduction in vegetation productivity in some of the most moisture-limited forest types, such as pH-ion-juniper and lower montane. This will decrease fuel accumulation rates and consequently reduce fire risk and result in longer fire return intervals. We consider four main management alternatives: fire suppression, wildfire (no intervention), prescribed fire, and mechanical thinning. The paper summarizes the effects of these treatments on forest ecosystem services, showing that they vary widely by forest type. This broad-scale assessment provides general guidance for forest managers and policy makers, and identifies more specific research needs on how climate-driven changes in fuel production and forest conditions will affect impact the four main forest ecosystems across the central Rocky Mountain region.

Statistical analyses reveal that changes in insolation and the Laurentide Ice Sheet explain 51.7% of the variance in the records, especially multi-millennial trends, but peak rates of change indicate additional rapid changes at ca. 10.8, 9.4, 8.3, 7.0, 5.5-5.2, 4.7, 2.1, and 0.9 ka. Step changes between 9.4 and 8.3 ka relate to ice sheet dynamics that warmed much of the region, and changes at 5.5 ka were the largest since the demise of the ice sheet. The shift at 5.5 ka initiated widespread cooling and increases in effective moisture, which culminated in the coolest, wettest millennia in most areas after 2.1 ka. Replicated evidence from multiple records also shows a spatially-varied set of multi-century fluctuations including 1) low temperatures and high effective moisture at 5.5-4.8 ka in the mid-continent and 2) repeated phases of low SSTs, cool summers, and drought superimposed upon long cooling, moistening trends in eastern North American since 5.5 ka.

Changing climate, altered disturbance regimes, land use, and increased herbivore pressure threaten these forests both in Eurasia and North America. In addition, rapid mortality dubbed ""Sudden Aspen Decline"" is a concern for aspen's long-term presence in the western United States, especially Colorado and Utah. Yet it is still unclear whether aspen is persistent or declining at the landscape scale. We assessed aspen persistence at different spatial scales in the Colorado Front Range by resampling 89 plots containing aspen from among 305 vegetation plots sampled by Robert Peet during 1972-1973. We hypothesized that aspen density and basal area had decreased at the landscape scale, with notable variability in change depending on the forest community type, and that this overall decrease has been more pronounced at lower elevations. We also assessed elevational range shifts of the major species in these forests. Aspen were no longer present in 22 of the 89 plots and aspen density for stems less than 2.5 cm diameter at breast height (DBH) had declined significantly overall, although density of medium (2.5-10 cm DBH) and large (>10 cm DBH) trees, as well as basal area, had not changed significantly. A comparison between montane (<2700 m elevation) and subalpine (2700-3500 m elevation) plots revealed that the decrease was more pronounced at higher elevations and was mostly the result of substantial decreases of stems in the eleven plots that were part of Peet's aspen-dominated ""Populus tremuloides series."" In these plots, aspen basal area decreased significantly whereas basal area of Abies bifolia, Picea engelmannii, Pinus contorta, and Pseudotsuga menziesii increased substantially. Upslope shifts were observed for most species, especially on northeast facing slopes, suggesting climate-related responses. In summary, aspen have been resilient in mixed forests and may be beneficiaries of recent bark beetle epidemics, but have decreased and been subject to successional transitions in previously aspen-dominated stands.

We sampled the fish communities at 12 local stream reaches spaced broadly throughout a relatively undisturbed watershed in the Ozark Mountains of northern Arkansas, USA, in 11 surveys from 1972 to 2012 at a scale of decades, and at a subset of five of these local sites in a total of 16 surveys, allowing tests of the LEC at different spatial and temporal scales. Multivariate analyses of the dynamics of communities over the 40-year period provided support for the LEC at both global and local scales within the watershed. At the broadest spatial scale, core species numerically dominated the community, and most common species remained so across all decades. In spite of two extraordinary floods, and interannual variation in abundance of some species, the 12-site and five-site global communities and eight of 12 local communities repeatedly returned toward average positions in multivariate space. Trajectories of the global and local fish communities varied relative to model hypothetical trajectories that were based on gradual vs. saltatory changes, and prevalence of returns toward average community structure. Beta diversity among sites was variable across time, but beta partitioning consistently showed that pure spatial turnover dominated over nestedness, because many common species were consistently distributed either upstream or downstream. This study suggests that vertebrate communities in relatively undisturbed environments may display dynamics consistent with the LEC. The LEC, combined with quantification of community trajectory patterns, can help to clarify whether systems are moving about within ranges of conditions that reflect expected noise, or, conversely, have moved so far out of previous bounds, as a result of climate change or human intervention, that they are permanently changed or novel.",2016,10.1890/14-2179.1,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WOS:000373565900016,Paris,No,,No,,Arkansas,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Courtney,No,No,No,,

By the mid-twenty-first century under RCP8.5, ensemble-mean winter snowfall is about 70% of baseline, whereas the corresponding value for RCP2.6 is somewhat higher (about 80% of baseline). By the end of the century, however, the two scenarios diverge significantly. Under RCP8.5, snowfall sees a dramatic further decline; 2081-2100 totals are only about half of baseline totals. Under RCP2.6, only a negligible further reduction from midcentury snowfall totals is seen. Because of the spread in the GCM climate projections, these figures are all associated with large intermodel uncertainty. Snowpack on the ground, as represented by 1 April snow water equivalent is also assessed. Because of enhanced snowmelt, the loss seen in snowpack is generally 50% greater than that seen in winter snowfall. By midcentury under RCP8.5, warming-accelerated spring snowmelt leads to snow-free dates that are about 1-3 weeks earlier than in the baseline period.",2016,10.1175/JCLI-D-15-0199.1,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,WOS:000367431600003,Paris,No,Yes,No,,CA,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Courtney,No,,No,california,

Two pollen cores from montane Uinta sites on the Utah-Wyoming border (Marsh lake Bog and Camp Bog, respectively) were used to analyze vegetation shifts from the latest Pleistocene through the Holocene. The records correspond with those from adjacent portions of the Rocky Mountains, all demonstrating a major shift from alpine steppe to open spruce parkland at similar to 11,7001-1,200 cal yr BP. A second major shift to lodgepole pine forest began at similar to 8400 cal yr BP at Marsh Lake Bog and could have been a direct response of the dominant species to warmer conditions and/or the result of subtle changes in the competitive hierarchy of tree species near a sensitive ecotone. The difference in the rate and full expression of lodgepole forest development (taking nearly 2000 years longer at Camp Bog) was probably due to a set of complex and local factors, such as cold air drainage and landscape position. Lodgepole pine forest persisted throughout the late Holocene and appears to be the long-term regional ""climax"" forest, rather than a seral habitat. Fire does not appear to have triggered the middle Holocene shift from spruce-dominated to lodgepole pine-dominated forests in this area but may have contributed to its long-term persistence to the present day.

Dissolved noble gas data have proven particularly useful in mountainous terrain because they can be used to determine recharge elevation. However, tracer-derived recharge elevations have not been utilized as calibration targets for numerical groundwater flow models. Herein, we constrain and calibrate a regional groundwater flow model with noble-gas-derived recharge elevations for the first time. Tritium and noble gas tracer results improved the site conceptual model by identifying a previously uncertain contribution of mountain block recharge from the Coast Mountains to an alluvial coastal aquifer in humid southwestern British Columbia. The revised conceptual model was integrated into a three-dimensional numerical groundwater flow model and calibrated to hydraulic head data in addition to recharge elevations estimated from noble gas recharge temperatures. Recharge elevations proved to be imperative for constraining hydraulic conductivity, recharge location, and bedrock geometry, and thus minimizing model nonuniqueness. Results indicate that 45% of recharge to the aquifer is mountain block recharge. A similar match between measured and modeled heads was achieved in a second numerical model that excludes the mountain block ( no mountain block recharge), demonstrating that hydraulic head data alone are incapable of quantifying mountain block recharge. This result has significant implications for understanding and managing source water protection in recharge areas, potential effects of climate change, the overall water budget, and ultimately ensuring groundwater sustainability.",2015,10.1002/2015WR017274,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Water Resources,WOS:000368418400015,Paris,No,Yes,No,,BC coastal mtns,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Courtney,No,,No,BC coast range,

They generally reduce land carbon stocks but also initiate a regrowth legacy that contributes substantially to the contemporary rate of carbon stock increase in US forestlands. As managers and policy makers increasingly look to forests for climate protection and mitigation, and because of increasing concern about changes in disturbance intensity and frequency, there is a need for synthesis and integration of current understanding about the role of disturbances and other processes in governing forest carbon cycle dynamics, and the likely future of this and other sinks for atmospheric carbon. This paper aims to address that need by providing a quantitative review of the distribution, extent and carbon impacts of the major disturbances active in the US. We also review recent trends in disturbances, climate, and other global environmental changes and consider their individual and collective contributions to the US carbon budget now and in the likely future. Lastly, we identify some key challenges and opportunities for future research needed to improve current understanding, advance predictive capabilities, and inform forest management in the face of these pressures. Harvest is found to be the most extensive disturbance both in terms of area and carbon impacts, followed by fire, windthrow and bark beetles, and lastly droughts. Collectively these lead to the gross loss of about 200 Tg C y(-1) in live biomass annually across the conterminous US. At the same time, the net change in forest carbon stocks is positive (190 Tg C y(-1)), indicating not only forest resilience but also an apparently large response to growth enhancements such as fertilization by CO2 and nitrogen. Uncertainty about disturbance legacies, disturbance interactions, likely trends, and global change factors make the future of the US forest carbon sink unclear. While there is scope for management to enhance carbon sinks in US forests, tradeoffs with other values and uses are likely to significantly limit practical implementation. Continued and expanded remote sensing and field-based monitoring capabilities and manipulative experimentation are needed to improve understanding of the US forest carbon sink, and assess how disturbance processes are responding to the pressures of global environmental change. In addition, continued development and application of holistic, decision support tools that consider a range of forest values are needed to enable managers and policy makers to use the best available information for guiding forest resources now and into the future.

As scientists have probed more deeply into species responses, a more nuanced perspective emerged indicating that some species may persist in microrefugia (refugia), including in mountainous terrain. Refugia are habitats that buffer climate changes and allow species to persist in-and to potentially expand under-changing environmental conditions. While climate and species interactions in refugia have been noted as sources of uncertainty, land management practices and disturbances, such as wildland fire, should also be considered when assessing any given refugium. Our landscape scale study suggests that cold-air pools, an important type of small-scale refugia, have unique fire occurrence, frequency, and severity patterns in frequent-fire mixed conifer forests of California's Sierra Nevada: cold-air pool refugia have less fire and if it occurs, it is lower severity. Therefore, individuals and small populations are less likely to be extirpated by fire. Active management, such as restoration and fuels treatments for climate change adaptation, may be required to maintain these distinctive and potentially important refugia.",2016,10.3390/f7040077,Forestry,WOS:000375210700005,Paris,No,,No,,CA,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Courtney,,,No,California,

LAI can be estimated using algorithms applied to airborne and satellite imagery, with ground-based measurements of LAI being required for calibration and validation. A variety of methods exist for ground-based and remote estimation of LAI, and this can lead to confusion and uncertainty regarding selection of methods, experimental design, and instrumentation. As a contribution towards clarifying these protocols, this paper investigated and compared three optical methods and an allometric technique for ground-based estimation of LAI, and these were related to remote LAI estimates derived from the compact airborne spectrographic imager (casi) using three vegetation indices (normalized difference, weighted difference, and soil-adjusted vegetation indices, or NDVI, WDVI, and SAVI, respectively) and subpixel-scale spectral mixture analysis (SMA). The study was conducted in the Kananaskis region of Alberta in the Canadian Rocky Mountains and considered four species compositions within a montane ecological subregion: lodgepole pine, white spruce, composite deciduous (aspen and balsam poplar), and mixedwood (mixture of deciduous and lodgepole pine or white spruce). LAI data were obtained in the field using a LI-COR, Inc. LAI-2000 instrument, a tracing radiation and architecture of canopies (TRAC) system, an integrated (LAI-2000 and TRAC) method, and an allometric technique that used the ratio of sapwood basal area to leaf area. A subsample of plots was assessed with hemispherical photographs and LAI-2000 data from which similar effective leaf area index (eLAI) values were derived for two of the four species analyzed. The results highlight the importance of ensuring that samples represent the range of stand structures and canopy architecture inherent in the species group being assessed. Foliage clumping was observed to be similar in both coniferous and deciduous species and an important element to measure. LAI estimates were influenced by the field methods used to estimate LAI, species and their canopy architecture, and the form of the vegetation index or subpixel-scale mixing derived from the casi image. Of the three vegetation indices, the SAVI was the statistically strongest predictor of LAI for mixedwood species, but all were poor LAI estimators for lodgepole pine and deciduous species. The subpixel-scale scene fractions from SMA provided the best prediction of LAI for white spruce compared with the three vegetation indices. The result for white spruce provides an encouraging basis for further investigation of SMA as a sampling tool to scale from field to high-resolution airborne and satellite imagery for local to landscape-level biophysical estimation.",2003,,Remote Sensing,WOS:000183349700011,Shana,Maybe,Yes,No,individual,Canadian Rockies--need to look at article for locaiton,NA,,,,,,Adrienne,No,Maybe,No,Alberta,Courtney,No,,No,Kananaskis region Alberta,

The study sites ranged from temperate rain forest to alpine forests near tree line. Soil temperature was a significant predictor of soil respiration at all sites, and soil moisture explained additional variability at three sites (R-2 from 0.42 to 0.90, P less than or equal to 0.01). Soil temperatures at the highest-elevation sites were 4.5degreesC cooler than those at the lowest elevation, but there were no relationships between soil respiration rates at a given temperature and elevation or mean annual temperature that would indicate acclimation of soil respiration to the cooler temperatures at high-elevation sites. Experimental urea additions (1.0 and 2.0 g N m(-2) y(-1)) made at seven of the sites had no consistent effect on soil respiration. Total soil carbon dioxide (CO2) efflux during the growing season (May-September) varied from 0.34 to 0.75 kg C/m(2) and was greater at low-elevation sites with warmer soil temperatures and longer growing seasons. Elevation and the length of the frost-free season could both be used to predict growing season (r(2) = 0.53) and annual (r(2) = 0.81) soil CO2 efflux for the 10 sites located in steep mountainous terrain.

Columnar calcites form through syndepositional lateral coalescence of crystallites and precipitate under stable hydrodynamic conditions in humid, temperate climates. Numerous discontinuities from short-lived events (<100 years) punctuate the calcites. Minor fabrics, such as transitional- and randomly-oriented elongate calcites are seeded on these discontinuities and detrital layers. Columnar calcites eventually overrun sub-horizontally oriented crystals as a result of competitive growth. Large (approximate to 750 mum) crystal terminations indicate growth under increased water film resulting from greater flow and/or ponding. 14 U-series dates provide mean growth rates of 5.6 to 27.9 mm/ka during interglacial periods (marine isotope stages 11 through 9, substage 5e, and late stage 2 through stage 1), and indicate short growth intervals during early- to mid-interglacial periods. Several outcrop-scale discontinuities represent periods of prolonged growth stoppage. Growth cessation occurred during the colder phases of stages 8-9 and 6-7, which translate into hiatuses of 77.5 and 99 ka respectively.

Here we focus on the physical template as it governs the distribution of mixed-conifer forests in California's Sierra Nevada. We extended a forest simulation model to examine montane environmental gradients, emphasizing factors affecting the water balance in these summer-dry landscapes. The model simulates the soil moisture regime in terms of the interaction of water supply and demand: supply depends on precipitation and water storage, while evapotranspirational demand varies with solar radiation and temperature. The forest cover itself can affect the water balance via canopy interception and evapotranspiration. We simulated Sierran forests as slope facets, defined as gridded stands of homogeneous topographic exposure, and verified simulated gradient response against sample quadrats distributed across Sequoia National Park. We then performed a modified sensitivity analysis of abiotic factors governing the physical gradient. Importantly, the model's sensitivity to temperature, precipitation, and soil depth varies considerably over the physical template, particularly relative to elevation. The physical drivers of the water balance have characteristic spatial scales that differ by orders of magnitude. Across large spatial extents, temperature and precipitation as defined by elevation primarily govern the location of the mixed conifer zone. If the analysis is constrained to elevations within the mixed-conifer zone, local topography comes into play as it influences drainage. Soil depth varies considerably at all measured scales, and is especially dominant at fine (within-stand) scales. Physical site variables can influence soil moisture deficit either by affecting water supply or water demand; these effects have qualitatively different implications for forest response. These results have clear implications about purely inferential approaches to gradient analysis, and bear strongly on our ability to use correlative approaches in assessing the potential responses of montane forests to anthropogenic climatic change.",2000,10.1023/A:1008183331604,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Physical Geography; Geology,WOS:000089421500002,Shana,No,Yes,No,,Sierra Nevada,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Courtney,No,,No,Sierra Nevadas,

Simulations of increased temperature indicated increased evapotranspiration and reduced water Aux, Simulations of changes in precipitation indicated disproportionately large variations in soil water flux because of the relative stability of evapotranspiration with changes in precipitation. Increased temperature caused N release from forest floors at all sites. Ar the N-saturated Nolan Divide site, this resulted in no change in N uptake or growth but increased soil solution Al and NO; and increased N leaching losses. At the N-limited sites, the release of N from the forest floor caused increased growth, and, in some cases, increased NO; leaching as well, indicating that N released from the forest floor was not efficiently taken up by the vegetation. Increased precipitation caused increased growth, and decreased precipitation caused reduced growth in the N-limited sites because of changes in wet N deposition. Changes in precipitation had no effect on growth in the N-saturated Nolan Divide site, but did cause large changes in soil solution mineral acid anion and Al concentrations, Increased precipitation caused long-term decreases in soil exchangeable base cations in most cases because of the disproportionately large effects on soil water flux; however, increased precipitation caused decreases in exchangeable base cations in cases when atmospheric deposition was a major source of base cations for the system. The simulation results illustrate the extreme complexity of the possible responses of nutrient cycling processes to climate change. By virtue of the fact that the NuCM model does not contain physiological algorithms, these simulations demonstrate that changes in temperature and precipitation can produce widely varying ecosystem-level responses through their effects on biogeochemical cycling processes alone and that generalizations about the relative importance of temperature versus precipitation changes are hazardous.

In this regard, it is particularly significant to provide valid data on simultaneous fluxes of carbon, water vapor and pollutants over representative ecosystems. Eddy covariance measurements and model analyses of such combined fluxes over a subalpine coniferous forest in southern Wyoming (USA) are presented. While the exchange of water vapor and ozone are successfully measured by the eddy covariance system: fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2) are uncertain. This is established by comparing measured fluxes with simulations produced by a detailed biophysical model (FORFLUX). The bias in CO2 flux measurements is partially attributed to below-canopy advection caused by a complex terrain. We emphasize the difficulty of obtaining continuous long-term flux data in mountainous areas by direct measurements. Instrumental records are combined with simulation models as a feasible approach to assess seasonal and annual ecosystem exchange of carbon, water and ozone in alpine environments. The viability of this approach is demonstrated by: (1) showing the ability of the FORFLUX model to predict observed fluxes over a 9-day period in the summer of 1996; and (2) applying the model to estimate seasonal dynamics and annual totals of ozone deposition and carbon. and water vapor exchange at our study site. Estimated fluxes above this subalpine ecosystem in 1996 are: 195 g C m(-2) year(-1) net ecosystem production, 277 g C m(-2) year(-1) net primary production, 535 mm year(-1) total evapotranspiration, 174 mm year(-1) canopy transpiration, 2.9 g m(-2) year(-1) total ozone deposition, and 1.72 g O-3 m(-2) year(-1) plant ozone uptake via leaf stomata. Given the large portion of non-stomatal ozone uptake (i.e. 41% of the total annual flux) predicted for this site, we suggest that future research of pollution-vegetation interactions should relate plant response to actively assimilated ozone by foliage rather than to total deposition. In this regard, we propose the Physiological Ozone Uptake Per Unit of Leaf Area (POUPULA) as a practical index for quantifying vegetation vulnerability to ozone damage.

Dual-permeability simulations shaw that in low infiltration regions chemical disequilibrium can exist between fracture and matrix porewaters, as a result of the climate change 10,000 years ago. Below the potential repository level, simulations show significant mixing due to lateral flow on top of the low permeability basal vitrophyre in the Topopah Spring unit and on zeolitized tuffs in the Calico Hills unit. Perched water chloride concentrations are closely matched using the calculated conditions for the last glacial maximum climate, with some component of Holocene recharge. Measured strontium concentrations in the UZ and in the perched water bodies can be roughly matched by assuming conservative behavior in nonzeolitic units and strong ion exchange in zeolitic units, and indicate that the perched water bodies are poorly mixed. Differences in the Cl contents of samples having a bomb-pulse Cl-36 signature and those with a modem ratio indicate that waters of intermediate Cl-36/Cl ratios may be mixtures, that without other isotopic data could be inferred as either Pleistocene or Holocene age waters.

Trends in the pollen and plant macrofossil record indicate increased effective precipitation, and particularly in soil moisture, over the last 4,000 years.

For instance, expansion of high elevation trees, e.g., mountain hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana) and red fir (Abies magnifica), during the late Holocene argues for increased effective precipitation. However, a decline in the upper elevation of mountain hemlock at ca. 2,500 years ago, and for fir at ca. 1,000 years ago, suggests intensification of cooler conditions.

Results are related to independently inferred vegetation and climate changes. No diatoms were found in the basal diamict that predates 11 330 C-14 yr BP. Very few occur until ca. 10 100 C-14 yr BP probably due to the short time between de-glaciation and an advance of the Crowfoot Glacier during the 'Younger Dryas Chron'. Initial pioneering species were characteristic of alkaline water and calcareous organic sediments. They appeared as sediments became organic and laminated suggesting increasing water clarity, and as the Pinus-dominated forest expanded and the climate warmed. After ca. 9060 C-14 yr BP diatom numbers increased rapidly, reaching a maximum prior to the Mazama tephra; they remained high until ca. 3500 C-14 Yr BP. The period between ca. 9060 and 3500 C-14 yr saw timberline elevation increase and the dominance of xerophytic taxa. These are consistent with early to mid-Holocene warmth and aridity. Diatom productivity reflects the warm climate and presumably longer ice-free season, a stable catchment and transparent water. Decreases in diatom productivity coincide with a vegetation change with reduction of xerophytic taxa and the appearance of a closed Picea-Abies forest, hence a cooler, wetter climate at ca. 4100 to 3500 C-14 yr BP The diatom numbers during the Neoglacial were of the same magnitude as prior to ca. 9060 C-14 yr BP. Small species of Fragilaria (overwhelmingly Fragilaria construens v. venter) became extremely dominant during the period of high diatom productivity, and remained so thereafter. Recovery of the lake appears to have been rapid after deposition of the Mazama tephra.

Loud. var. murrayana), and its relationship to climate change, within the Sierra Nevada. During Late-Wisconsin deglaciation, lodgepole pine grew at least 500 m lower in elevation than today. Lodgepole pine was widely established within its modern elevational range between 10 500 and 9000 years BP. During the early Holocene, lodgepole pine remained an integral member of montane forest assemblages below its present elevational range. Macrofossil evidence suggests successive disappearance from most lower elevation sites between 9000 and 6750 years BP. A likely explanation suggests progressive climatic warming and drying of soils during the dry early Holocene, causing local extermination at the lower elevation sires. Within its present elevational range, a lack of macrofossils and a decline in diploxylon pollen suggests possible absence of lodgepole pine near several sites during the middle Holocene, with the tree continuing a retreat to higher, cooler elevations during this time. A return to lower elevation sites after ca 1700 years BP probably resulted from cumulative cooling during the Neoglacial. The postglacial migration pattern for Sierra lodgepole pine differs somewhat from that of the more widely distributed Rocky Mountain subspecies (P. contorta var. latifolia). While the pattern for the Rocky Mountain lodgepole was both latitudinal and elevational (only now reaching its northernmost extent in Canada [Cwynar & McDonald, 1987]), Sierra lodgepole's migration was largely elevational with little migrational lag. Additional paleo-sites south of the present distribution of ssp. murrayana will help to clarify any latitudinal movements during the late Wisconsin.",1996,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WOS:A1996VJ70800015,Shana,No,,No,,Sierra Nevada,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Courtney,No,,No,Sierra Nevada,

From western Asia, early Mimomys dispersed both east and west (to North America and to Europe), arriving at about the same time in both areas as a slightly larger and more evolved form that is essentially identical in both continents. Different species names are applied, as they obviously represent the beginnings of geographically separate lineages. The immigration of Mimomys to North America marks the beginning of the Blancan Mammal Age by original definition. The earliest dated North American record is the Upper Alturas Fauna of California, which is well dated by paleomagnetic stratigraphy, tephra ""fingerprinting"", and potassium-argon dating at 4.8 Ma. Lindsay et al. (1999) have supported this age by paleornagnetic stratigraphy in two areas of Nevada. One other known fauna, the Maxum fauna of Contra Costa County, California, contains immigrant Mimomys that may be slightly older, but is not dated. Dispersal of the temperate-climate genus Mimomys between Eurasia and North America was through the Beringian Faunal Region, near the latitude of the Arctic Circle, and later intercontinental continuity of the genus was severely restricted by climate, not water. Other microtine rodents, more tolerant of cooler latitudes, were able to cross the Bering land area and thus integrate the biochronologies of the two continents, but the genus Mimomys is of little use in intercontinental correlation during most of the Pliocene. Eurasia and North America contain many faunal regions, and the temperate United States comprises at least two, separated by the Rocky Mountains. Each faunal region has, to an extent limited by its isolation, unique faunas and a different historic biochronology. Although the first Mimomys immigrants to North America and Europe were very similar, the genus evolved independently on the separate continents for the next 3.4 m.y., producing species, subgenera, and ultimately, new genera dramatically different in the two areas. During this isolation, separate lineages in the United States resulted in the subgenus M. (Cosomys) and the genus Ophiomys in the Western Faunal Region and in the subgenus M. (Ogmodontomys) and the genus Hibbardomys in the Eastern Faunal Region. Although also climatically constrained, the barrier to dispersal between these two faunal regions of the United States was much less rigorous than in Beringia. Several times taxa dispersed along two documented routes between the Eastern and Western Faunal Regions of the United States: through Yellowstone Pass in western Wyoming and around the southern end of the Rocky Mountains through Arizona and New Mexico. These faunal interchanges are useful in correlating the two regional biochronologies, and times of exchange correlate with the climate changes that made the Rocky Mountains, or the region to the south of it, habitable by temperate Miniomys. About 1.3 Ma, global warming again permitted Mimomys to disperse through Beringia. At or slightly before this second immigration of Mimomys, the descendants of the first immigration had become extinct or had evolved into forms no longer conforming to the diagnosis of Mimomys. The new immigrants are assigned to the Eurasian subgenus Mimomys (Cromeromys) and they are known to have lived well into the Irvingtonian mammal age, less than 0.78 Ma. Present records thus indicate that the genus Mimomys and derived forms lived in the United States for over four million years before they became extinct.",2003,10.1206/0003-0090(2003)279<0469:C>2.0.CO;2,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WOS:000186887100018,Shana,Maybe,No,No,,,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Courtney,Yes,Maybe,No,Global Mountains Study,

Moreover, different species and different populations of the same species may react in different ways to the same environmental insult.

Using the drainage area/lake area ratios the mean sedimentation rates of the lakes were calculated for a porosity of 0.3. The mean sedimentation rates of different lake types vary between 0.1 mm/a (glacial lakes, lowland) and 5.4 mm/a (mostly sag basin lakes). The calculated lifetimes of the lakes are based on the lake volumes and mean sedimentation rates, assuming steady-state conditions and solely clastic material. On average, glacial lakes in highlands and fault-related lakes show the shortest lifetimes (c. 70 ka), glacial lakes in lowlands and rift lakes have the longest lifetimes (c. 1 Ma). Some lakes remain unfilled for very long time spans due to rapid subsidence of their basin floors. The calculated lifetimes are compared with those derived from sediment core studies. Most core studies indicate lower mechanical sedimentation rates than the calculated ones because a major part of the incoming sediment is trapped in deltas. However, a number of lakes (e.g., the Great Lakes of North America) show the opposite tendency which is largely caused by extensive shoreline erosion and resuspension. The lifetimes of large glacial lakes often exceed the duration of interglacials. Hence, their lifetimes are restricted by glaciation and not by sediment infill. Rift lakes persist for long time periods which exceed the calculated lifetimes in some cases.

Here, we demonstrate a new method for producing quantitative time series of lake elevation based on the fades and elevations of multiple cores collected from a lake's margin. The approach determines the facies represented in each core using diagnostic data, such as sand content, and then compares the results across cores to determine the elevation of the littoral zone over time. By applying the approach computationally, decisions are made systematically and iteratively using different facies classification schemes to evaluate the associated uncertainty. After evaluating our assumptions using ground-penetrating radar (GPR), we quantify past lake-elevation changes, precipitation minus evapotranspiration (Delta(P-ET)), and uncertainty in both at Lake of the Woods and Little Windy Hill Pond, Wyoming. The well-correlated (r = 0.802 +/- 0.002) reconstructions indicate that water levels at both lakes fell at > 11,300,8000-5500, and 4700-1600 cal yr BP when Delta(P-ET) decreased to -50 to -250 mm/yr. Differences between the reconstructions are typically small (10 +/- 4 mm/yr since 7000 cal yr BP), and the similarity indicates that our reconstruction method can produce statistically comparable paleohydrologic datasets across networks of sites.

Present deglaciation is increasing the number and size of proglacial lakes around the world. This study provides a synthesis of knowledge on proglacial lake character and behaviour and critically evaluates the importance of proglacial lakes from a geological perspective. We show how 'ice-marginal' or 'ice-contact' lakes and other distal proglacial lakes can be distinguished from each other by geomorphological, sedimentological, chemical and biological characteristics. The key controls on proglacial lake geomorphology and sedimentology are outlined and discussed. Proglacial lakes can exacerbate mountain glacier and ice sheet margin ablation via mechanical and thermal stresses, but very large lakes can moderate summer air temperatures and relatively retard summer ice ablation. Proglacial lakes interrupt meltwater flux and are very efficient sediment traps. Hydrological routing and consequent geomorphological activity can be radically modified by sudden drainage of proglacial lakes and resultant glacial lake outburst floods; exceptionally large proglacial lake drainages affected global ocean circulation and global climate during the Quaternary. Overall, analyses of proglacial lakes can provide a valuable insight into (i) patterns, character and behaviour of mountain glaciers, ice sheets and glaciations, and (ii) the impacts of past, present and future deglaciation.

Here, we use oxygen and hydrogen isotopic data from Miocene sedimentary deposits to characterize the topographic evolution of the southern Columbia Plateau/Snake River Plain and northern Rocky Mountain regions during the Yellowstone hotspot passage, with the ultimate goal of understanding whether topographic changes caused by the hotspot influenced mammalian evolution within those regions. We conducted oxygen isotope analyses of 130 samples of lacustrine, and paleosol carbonate from Miocene stratigraphic sections that span much of the northern Rocky Mountain region, and combined these data with previously published isotopic records. Collectively these isotopic data show that caldera formation associated with the Yellowstone hotspot has modified regional topography and rearranged drainages along the track of the hotspot, and that the hotspot has left a topographic depression in its wake. We explore the extent to which these topographic changes influenced or are decoupled from diversity changes exhibited by the local mammal faunas and conclude that the passage of the hotspot and consequent surface uplift created rainshadows in the lee of high-elevation calderas and/or generated large volumes of volcanic materials, influencing soils and vegetation. Collectively, that may explain a possible rise in mammal diversity in the CP/SRP region at similar to 14 Ma, coincident with a drop in diversity in the NRM. It is still unclear, however, how different taphonomic pathways and sample-standardization problems are influencing apparent diversity peaks at this temporal and geographic resolution.

In western North America, mass-balance records span four to five decades and capture a relatively narrow window of glacial behavior over an interval that was dominated by warming and ablation. We use temperature- and moisture-sensitive tree-ring series to reconstruct annual mass balance for six glaciers in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska. Mass-balance models rely on the climatic sensitivity of tree-ring chronologies and teleconnection patterns in the North Pacific. The reconstructions extend through the mid to latter portions of the Little Ice Age (LIA) and explore the role of climate variability in forcing mass balance across multiple environmental gradients. Synchronous positive mass-balance intervals coincide with regional moraine building and solar minima, whereas differences in LIA glacier behavior are related to synoptic climate forcing. Secular warming in the late 19th century to present corresponds with the only multi-decadal intervals of negative mass balance in all glacier reconstructions. This suggests that contemporary retreat in western North America is unique with respect to the last several centuries and that regional patterns of glacier variability are now dominated by global climate forcing.

The limited surface area, conical bathymetry, and deep water (> 31 m) of Crevice Lake create oxygen-deficient conditions in the hypolimnion and preserve annually laminated sediment (varves) for much of the record. Pollen data indicate that the watershed supported a closed Pinus-dominated forest and low fire frequency prior to 8200 cal yr BP, followed by open parkland until 2600 cal yr BP, and open mixed-conifer forest thereafter. Fire activity shifted from infrequent stand-replacing fires initially to frequent surface fires in the middle Holocene and stand-replacing events in recent centuries. Low values of delta O-18 suggest high winter precipitation in the early Holocene, followed by steadily drier conditions after 8500 cal yr BP. Carbonate-rich sediments before 5000 cal yr BP imply warmer summer conditions than after 5000 cal yr BP. High values of molybdenum (Mo), uranium (U), and sulfur (S) indicate anoxic bottom-waters before 8000 cal yr BP, between 4400 and 3900 cal yr BP, and after 2400 cal yr BP. The diatom record indicates extensive water-column mixing in spring and early summer through much of the Holocene, but a period between 2200 and 800 cal yr BP had strong summer stratification, phosphate limitation, and oxygen-deficient bottom waters. Together, the proxy data suggest wet winters, protracted springs, and warm effectively wet summers in the early Holocene and less snowpack, cool springs, warm dry summers in the middle Holocene. In the late Holocene, the region and lake experienced extreme changes in winter, spring, and summer conditions, with particularly short springs and dry summers and winters during the Roman Warm Period (similar to 2000 cal yr BP) and Medieval Climate Anomaly (1200-800 cal yr BP). Long springs and mild summers occurred during the Little Ice Age, and these conditions persist to the present. Although the proxy data indicate effectively wet summer conditions in the early Holocene and drier conditions in the middle and late Holocene, none point specifically to changes in summer precipitation as the cause. Instead, summer conditions were governed by multi-seasonal controls on effective moisture that operated over multiple time scales. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Data from modern fluvial sediments provide the basis for interpreting changes in provenance of detrital material in the lake cores. Sediments from small streams draining elevated topography on the east and west sides of the lake are characterized by abundant dolomite, high magnetic susceptibility ( MS) related to eolian magnetite, and low values of hard isothermal remanent magnetization (HIRM, indicative of hematite content). In contrast, sediments from the headwaters of the Bear River in the Uinta Mountains lack carbonate and have high HIRM and low MS. Sediments from lower reaches of the Bear River contain calcite but little dolomite and have low values of MS and HIRM. These contrasts in catchment properties allow interpretation of the following sequence from variations in properties of the lake sediment: (1) ca. 26 cal ka-onset of glaciation; (2) ca. 26-20 cal ka-quasi-cyclical, millennial-scale variations in the concentrations of hematite-rich glacial flour derived from the Uinta Mountains, and dolomite-and magnetite-rich material derived from the local Bear Lake catchment (reflecting variations in glacial extent); (3) ca. 20-19 cal ka-maximum content of glacial flour; (4) ca. 19-17 cal ka-constant content of Bear River sediment but declining content of glacial flour from the Uinta Mountains; (5) ca. 17-15.5 cal ka-decline in Bear River sediment and increase in content of sediment from the local catchment; and (6) ca. 15.5-14.5 cal ka-increase in content of endogenic calcite at the expense of detrital material. The onset of glaciation indicated in the Bear Lake record postdates the initial rise of Lake Bonneville and roughly corresponds to the Stansbury shoreline. The lake record indicates that maximum glaciation occurred as Lake Bonneville reached its maximum extent ca. 20 cal ka and that deglaciation was under way while Lake Bonneville remained at its peak. The transition from siliciclastic to carbonate sedimentation probably indicates increasingly evaporative conditions and may coincide with the climatically driven fall of Lake Bonneville from the Provo shoreline. Although lake levels fluctuated during the Younger Dryas, the Bear Lake record for this period is more consistent with drier conditions, rather than cooler, moister conditions interpreted from many studies from western North America.",2009,10.1130/2009.2450(11),Geology,WOS:000271276500012,Courtney,No,Yes,No,Ecosystem/Municipal,Bear Lake,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Courtney,Maybe,Maybe,Paleo,Barely in the basin too,

Paleomagnetic data exhibit a geomagnetic feature that possibly occurred during the Laschamp excursion (ca. 40 ka). Although the feature does not exhibit excursional behavior (= 40 departure from the expected value), it might provide an additional age constraint for the sequence. Temporal changes in salinity, which are likely related to changes in freshwater input (mainly through the Bear River) or evaporation, are indicated by variations in mineral magnetic properties. These changes are represented by intervals with preserved detrital Fe-oxide minerals and with varying degrees of diagenetic alteration, including sulfidization. On the basis of these changes, the Bear Lake sequence is divided into seven mineral magnetic zones. The differing magnetic mineralogies among these zones reflect changes in deposition, preservation, and formation of magnetic phases related to factors such as lake level, river input, and water chemistry. The occurrence of greigite and pyrite in the lake sediments corresponds to periods of higher salinity. Pyrite is most abundant in intervals of highest salinity, suggesting that the extent of sulfidization is limited by the availability of SO42-. During MIS 2 (zone II), Bear Lake transgressed to capture the Bear River, resulting in deposition of glacially derived hematite-rich detritus from the Uinta Mountains. Millennial- scale variations in the hematite content of Bear Lake sediments during the last glacial maximum (zone II) resemble Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) oscillations and Heinrich events (within dating uncertainties), suggesting that the influence of millennial-scale climate oscillations can extend beyond the North Atlantic and influence climate of the Great Basin. The magnetic mineralogy of zones IV-VII (MIS 5, 6, and 7) indicates varying degrees of post-depositional alteration between cold and warm substages, with greigite forming in fresher conditions and pyrite in the more saline conditions.",2009,10.1130/2009.2450(13),Geology,WOS:000271276500014,Courtney,No,Yes,No,Ecosystem/Municipal,"Bear Lake, similar to above, in Idaho but great basin drainage",NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Courtney,Maybe,Maybe,Paleo,Same as above,

During glacial periods, ice may have covered around 30 per cent of the Earth surface compared to approximately 10 per cent nowadays. With global change, polar environments and other montainous glacial environments of the world are presently undergoing the most important changes since the end of the Last Glacial Maximum and are experiencing paraglacial and paraperiglacial geomorphological readjustments. Paraglacial and paraperiglacial landsystems consist of several subsystems including gravitational, fluvial, coastal, aeolian and lacustrine environments. Paraglacial and paraperiglacial landsystems can be analysed as open and complex landsystems characterized by energy, water and sediment fluxes and exchange with surrounding environments, especially with glacial and periglacial landsystems as inputs. Those cascading landsystems are likely to react to climate change because they rely on an ice-cold water stock (glacier and permafrost) that developed during a previous cold sequence (glaciation). The response of paraglacial and paraperiglacial systems to climatic forcing takes place over a long time span ranging from an immediate reaction to several millennia. The spatial limits of paraglacial and paraperiglacial landsystems are inherently dependant on the time scale over which the system is analyzed. During the Pleistocene, glaciations widely affected the high latitudes and the high altitudes of the Earth and were followed by inherited paraglacial sequences. Glacier forelands in Arctic and alpine areas experience paraglacial processes with the present warming. The expected global warming for the twenty-first century will result in significant impacts on present glacier areas in mountains and could result in the appearance of new areas for paraglacial dynamics. In permafrost terrain, landscapes underwent a similar paraperiglacial geomorphological adjustment in mountainous, continental and coastal areas, with permafrost thaw-degradation and thermokarst processes.",2008,,Geology,WOS:000263152200002,Courtney,No,Yes,No,,glaciers,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Courtney,Maybe,Maybe,Paleo,Seems very broad,

We propose that stress complexes, combinations of biotic and abiotic stresses, compromise the vigor and ultimate sustainability of forest ecosystems. Across western North America, increased water deficit will accelerate the normal stress complex experienced in forests, which typically involves some combination of multi-year drought, insects, and fire. Four examples suggest how stress complexes are region-specific. Symptoms of prolonged drought and insects are currently manifested in extensive dieback of pine species in the pinyon-juniper forest of the American Southwest, an area where only a few tree species can survive. Air pollution and high stand densities from fire exclusion have compromised mixed-conifer forests of the Sierra Nevada. Bark beetles are proliferating and killing millions of hectares of dry forest in the northern interior of western North America, setting up the prospect of large and intense fires. Fire and insect mortality have also exceeded previously recorded levels in both interior and south-central Alaska, possibly precipitating extensive ecosystem changes, while extensive permafrost degradation is causing other changes. Increases in fire disturbance superimposed on forests with increased stress from drought and insects may have significant effects on growth, regeneration, long-term distribution and abundance of forest species, and short- and long-term carbon sequestration.

However, little information is available on the subsequent deterioration of tropical habitats in the interior of North America after these major warming episodes. The decline of tropical habitats is thought to have begun during the middle Eocene in the interior of North America, but until now, no studies have been able to document the details of this event. Recent fossil collection and stratigraphic studies from sites in southwestern Wyoming and northeastern Utah that span the middle Eocene offer a unique opportunity to evaluate changes in habitat in the western interior. Using a discriminant function analysis, habitats were reconstructed for a sequence of eight stratigraphically controlled middle Eocene assemblages. Adaptive profiles (diets, substrate use, and body masses) of fossil mammal communities were statistically compared to those of extant faunas from a variety of Neotropical habitats. Previously published magnetostratigraphic data from Utah provided a means to correlate our stratigraphic sections to the geomagnetic polarity time scale and the oxygen isotope record. The discriminant model shows that there was a significant change in the mammalian community ecology near the end of the late middle Eocene that is likely reflective of a habitat shift. When correlated to the time scale and oxygen isotope record, this key transition from forested habitats typical of the tropical early Eocene to more open woodlands began about 42 million years ago in this region of the Rocky Mountains.

Occurrence of these macrofossils during the period of time associated with the 1920/1930 A.D. mountain pine beetle outbreak at Baker Lake, Montana suggest that when beetle populations reach epidemic levels, beetle remains may be found in the lake sediments. In addition to the beetle remains found at Baker Lake during the 20th century, remains were also identified from ca. 8331, 8410, and 8529 cal yr BP. At Hoodoo Lake, Idaho remains were found at ca. 7954 and 8163 cal yr BP.

Sedimentary charcoal and pollen analyses were used to document fire and vegetation changes over the last 3800 years, which were then compared to similar records from AD 1880 to 2000. The long-term record at Foy Lake suggests shifts between forest and steppe as well as changes in fire regime that are likely the result of climate change. Fire activity (inferred from the frequency of charcoal peaks) averaged 18 fire episodes/1000 years from 3800 to 2125 cal year BP, and increased from 16 fire episodes/1000 years at 2125 cal year BP to 22 episodes/1000 years at 750 cal year BP, a period when the pollen data suggest that steppe vegetation yielded to increasing patches of forest cover. Between 2125 and 750 cal year BP, increased forest cover produced more background charcoal than before and after this period, when vegetation was dominated by steppe. Between 750 and 75 cal year BP steppe has expanded and fire episode frequency averaged 33 episodes/1000 years, increasing to a maximum of 40 episodes/1000 years at ca. 300 cal year BP and then decreasing to present levels. Since AD 1880, the pollen record indicates an increase in shrubs and grasses from AD 1895 to 1960 as a result of vegetation changes associated with timber harvesting and livestock grazing. No fires have been documented in the Foy Lake watershed since AD 1880. Charcoal from the extralocal fires of AD 1910, burning over 4,111,249 ha in Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming, however, is present in Foy Lake. Between AD 1970 and 2000, increased arboreal pollen in the record is consistent with observations that the forest has become more closed. The activities of Euro-Americans have led to a decline in forest cover between AD 1880 and 1970, followed by a recent increase as trees are now growing in areas previously occupied by steppe. Euro-Americans are likely the cause of a reduction in fire activity in watershed since AD 1880. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

These data when combined with previously published work show that the surface uplift history varied in both space and time. Surface uplift migrated from north to south with high elevations in southern British Columbia and northeastern Washington in the middle Eocene and development of surface uplift in north and central Nevada in the Oligocene.

Five pollen zones span the period from about 11 700 to 9700 radiocarbon years before present (yr BP) or 13 700 to 11 200 calibrated calendar years before present (cal BP). Climate during this interval is inferred to have ranged from cool continental to warm and dry. Changes in pollen assemblages, lithology, and loss on ignition in Mike Lake sediments deposited prior to 11 000 yr BP (13 000 cal BP) may signal the Sumas glacial advance, which has been dated elsewhere in the Fraser Lowland to this time. Palynologic and sedimentological data indicate that there was much climatic and ecological variability in southwestern British Columbia during the Younger Dryas chronozone. Detrended correspondence analysis of modern pollen from lake-sediment surface samples collected throughout British Columbia is used to compare Mike Lake fossil pollen assemblages to modern vegetation zones. The inferred vegetation assemblage during most of the Younger Dryas chronozone indicates a progressively warming climate with a cool interval between 10 400 and 10 000 yr BP. The pollen assemblage in this interval is similar to that of present subalpine forests on the west coast of Canada. The cooling coincides with the later part of the Younger Dryas chronozone and occurred too late to be the driving mechanism for the final Sumas advance, which peaked around 11 300 C-14 yr BP (13 200 cat BP).

Systematic study of these deposits may prove useful in understanding regional variations in response to global Holocene climate change. Oxygen isotope ratios of goethites from the mountainous northeastern Yellowstone region show an increase of similar to 3 parts per thousand over the past 9000 years. We attribute this isotopic change to a local increase of isotopically heavier summer precipitation since the early Holocene, possibly augmented by seasonal temperature differences brought on by orbitally forced insolation changes over the past 9000 years.

The majority of stratal relationships documented herein from a number of long-term climatic, sedimentologic, and shelf settings are consistent with a hypothesis that relative highs in sea level are accompanied by more seasonal conditions, whereas relative lows are characteristically more arid, Uncommon deviations are present, however, and may be due to (1) shoaling caused by sedimentation or tectonic uplift, independent of a eustatic-climatic signal; (2) complex sedimentologic or geomorphic responses to climate change; (3) leads,lags, or thresholds in either glacial advance and retreat or the climatic response to such changes.

Regional context, notably the spatial complexity of climatic gradients, may influence species migration potential. While high-elevation species may benefit from steep climate gradients in mountain regions, their persistence may be threatened by limited suitable habitat as land area decreases with elevation. To untangle these apparently contradictory predictions for mountainous regions, we evaluated the climatic suitability of four coniferous forest tree species of the western United States based on species distribution modeling (SDM) and examined changes in climatically suitable areas under predicted climate change. We used forest structural information relating to tree species dominance, productivity, and demography from an extensive forest inventory system to assess the strength of inferences made with a SDM approach. We found that tree species dominance, productivity, and recruitment were highest where climatic suitability (i.e., probability of species occurrence under certain climate conditions) was high, supporting the use of predicted climatic suitability in examining species risk to climate change. By predicting changes in climatic suitability over the next century, we found that climatic suitability will likely decline, both in areas currently occupied by each tree species and in nearby unoccupied areas to which species might migrate in the future. These trends were most dramatic for high elevation species. Climatic changes predicted over the next century will dramatically reduce climatically suitable areas for high-elevation tree species while a lower elevation species, Pinus ponderosa, will be well positioned to shift upslope across the region. Reductions in suitable area for high-elevation species imply that even unlimited migration would be insufficient to offset predicted habitat loss, underscoring the vulnerability of these high-elevation species to climatic changes.",NA,,,,Adrienne,Yes,Yes,Yes,Landscape/State-Province,,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Courtney,Yes,,Yes,Western US,

The pattern analysis at the provincial level reveals that the 1980s outbreak did not crash as originally thought. The current outbreak is most likely a result of the progressive buildup of the epidemic infestations during the transition period (1985-1995) under favourable weather conditions and substantially improved host resources. This is also true for the Northeast and Cariboo areas of the province specifically, even though the infestations in the Cariboo area remained at incipient-epidemic levels during the transition period after the 1980s outbreak crashed in 1985. In the Southeast area, the current outbreak apparently continued from the outbreak that initiated in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The 1980s outbreak originated from multiple spatially separate locations whereas the current outbreak initiated from a single location in Tweedsmuir Provincial Park. The centralized and self-amplifying buildup of the current outbreak implicates at least three substantial expansions that occurred in 2002, 2006, and 2008. This study suggests that at the provincial level, as well as for the Northeast and Southeast areas of the province, the current outbreak is declining but most likely will continue for many years given the ongoing and future warming climate and a large proportion of pines that remain in the habitats of mountain pine beetles.

Data agreement, temporal trends, and the potential effects on snow distribution were evaluated using two in situ sites in an alpine region [Niwot Ridge in Colorado and the Glacier Lakes Ecological Experiments Station (GLEES) in Wyoming] and the corresponding grid cells of the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR). Temperature, precipitation, and wind speed variables were used to assess blowing-snow trends at annual, seasonal, and daily scales. The correlation between NARR and in situ datasets showed that temperature data were correlated but that wind speed and precipitation were not. NARR wind speed data were systematically lower when compared with in situ data, yet the frequency of wind events was captured. Overall, there were not many significant differences between NARR and in situ wind speed trends at annual, seasonal, and daily scales, aside from GLEES daily values. This finding held true even when trends presented opposite signatures and slopes, which was likely a result of low trend slopes. The lack of agreement between datasets prohibited the use of NARR to broaden analyses for blowing-snow dynamics in alpine regions.",2014,10.1175/JAMC-D-13-092.1,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,WOS:000333034700008,Adrienne,No,Yes,No,,,Paris,No,Yes,No,,"CO, WY",NA,,,,,Courtney,Yes,Yes,Yes,very regional,

These data sets were derived from a variety of fish sampling techniques, including weirs, screw traps, redd counts, daytime snorkeling, electrofishing, and angler creel. Bull Trout populations in Idaho were relatively stable prior to 1994, but after 1994, substantially more population growth rates trended statistically upward (n = 14) than downward (n = 3). Average intrinsic rates of population change were 0.01 (SE = 0.03) prior to 1994 and 0.07 (SE = 0.02) after 1994; across all years of data, the rate of change averaged 0.07 (SE = 0.02). Fifty-nine percent of the data sets had zero to minimal observation error according to Gompertz state-space model estimates; observation error was least common in data from screw traps and redd counts and most common in snorkel data. Gompertz-type density-dependent models were most often the best-fitting models for Bull Trout population growth. Moreover, few of the most reliable modeling results (i.e., those from data sets estimated to have zero to minimal observation error) contained a period effect or time (i.e., year) effect, suggesting that carrying capacity generally did not differ between the pre-1994 and post-1994 periods and generally was not trending positively or negatively through time. Parametric bootstraps predicted that the mean probability of falling below the quasi-extinction level of 20 adults in the next 30years was 9.8% (median = 4.7%) for data sets estimated to have zero to minimal observation error. The weight of evidence from our modeling results suggests that for most Bull Trout populations in Idaho, abundance is stable or increasing and the risk of extirpation in the foreseeable future is low.

The snowmelt schemes have been tested with a point measurement dataset at the Cotton Creek Experimental Watershed (CCEW) in British Columbia, Canada and with a detailed dataset available from the Dranse de Ferret catchment, an extensively monitored catchment in the Swiss Alps. The snowmelt model performance is quantified with the use of a spatially-explicit model of the hydrologic response. Comparative analyses are presented with the widely-known, grid-based method proposed by Hock which combines a local, temperature-index approach with potential radiation. The results suggest that a simple diurnal cycle of the degree-day melt parameter based on minimum and maximum temperatures is competitive with the Hock approach for sub-daily melt simulations. Advantages of the new extension of the classical degree-day method over other temperature-index methods include its use of physically-based, diurnal variations and its ability to be adapted to data-constrained hydrological models which are lumped in some nature.

We found that periodic annual increment (PAI) of diameter, basal area (BA), volume, and aboveground dry mass were significantly related to stand density index (SDI) and stand age at start of the period; the quadratic trends varied among sites. Precipitation departure from the normal for each period explained a significant amount of residual variation in all PAI variables except diameter. BA production did not change significantly as SDI exceeded 270 trees.ha(-1) at the OR sites and 320 trees.ha(-1) at the CA site. Stand productivity was the highest at Elliot Ranch (CA) and the least at Blue Mountains (OR). A similar trend held in growth efficiency under lower stand densities (SDI < 600). Most of the mortality was caused by Dendroctonus bark beetles in stands that exceeded SDI of 500 trees.ha(-1).

The goal of this study is to predict the potential effects of future climate change on population connectivity and genetic diversity of American marten populations across a 30.2 million hectare region of the in the US northern Rocky Mountains. We use a landscape resistance model validated from empirical landscape genetics modeling to predict the current and expected future extent and fragmentation of American marten dispersal habitat under five climate change scenarios, corresponding to climatic warming of between 0.7 and 3.3 A degrees C, consistent with expected climate change by year 2080. We predict the regions of the current and future landscapes where gene flow is expected to be governed by isolation by distance and the regions where population fragmentation is expected to limit gene flow. Finally, we predict changes in the strength and location of predicted movement corridors, fracture zones and the location of dispersal barriers across the study area in each scenario. We found that under the current climate, gene flow is predicted to be limited primarily by distance (isolation), and landscape structure does not significantly limit gene flow, resulting in very high genetic diversity over most of the study area. Projected climatic warming substantially reduces the extent and increases the fragmentation of marten populations in the western and northwestern parts of the study area. In contrast, climate change is not predicted to fragment the extensive higher elevation mountain massifs in central Idaho, the northern U.S. continental divide, and Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.

Location The contiguous United States west of the eastern border of the Rocky Mountains (103.77 degrees W). Methods Museum records of 67 mammalian species from two time periods (190039 and 19702009), mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation are used to model historic and modern distributions. For each era the region outside each species' range in the opposing era is assigned to zones of range limitation: temperature alone is prohibitive, moisture alone is prohibitive, both preclude the species, or both have values that alone are within the species' tolerance range but in combination are outside its climatic niche (interaction' limitation). The relative importance of each type of limitation is estimated by their intersection with regions of range contraction and expansion. Results Averaged across species, 82 +/- 3% (+/- SE) of the areas of contraction are now occupied by interaction limitation, and 74 +/- 5% of areas expanded into were historically occupied by similar zones. In comparison, areas of range shift in which just temperature or moisture acting alone would have excluded the species comprise between only 9 and 17%, and areas in which both factors are limiting are negligible. Expansions into and contractions from regions of interaction limitation occurred more often than expected by chance given the distribution of this type of limitation in the wider study region.

Warming since the 1850s, increases in annual mean temperature of at least 2 degrees C between 2000 and 2050 are highly probable. Annual mean temperatures across the Canadian boreal zone could be 4-5 degrees C warmer than today's by 2100. All aspects of boreal forest ecosystem function are likely to be affected. Further, several potential ""tipping elements"" - where exposure to increasing changes in climate may trigger distinct shifts in ecosystem state - can be identified across the Canadian boreal zone. Approximately 40% of the forested area is underlain by permafrost, some of which is already degrading irreversibly, triggering a process of forest decline and re-establishment lasting several decades, while also releasing significant quantities of greenhouse gases that will amplify the future global warming trend. Warmer temperatures coupled with significant changes in the distribution and timing of annual precipitation are likely to cause serious tree-killing droughts in the west; east of the Great Lakes, however, where precipitation is generally nonlimiting, warming coupled with increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide may stimulate higher forest productivity. Large wildfires, which can cause serious economic losses, are expected to become more frequent, but increases in mean annual area burned will be relatively gradual. The most immediate threats could come from endemic forest insect pests that have the potential for population outbreaks in response to relatively small temperature increases. Quantifying the multiple effects of climate change will be challenging, particularly because there are great uncertainties attached to possible interactions among them, as well as with other land-use pressures.

To investigate the influence of climate change on the water balance and streamflow of the UCRB, simulations are made for a 20-member ensemble made up of seven global climate models (GCMs) run under three emissions scenarios (A1B, A2, and B1 (with one exception)) for three future periods (2020s, 2050s, and 2080s) downscaled using Bias Corrected Spatial Disaggregation and simulated via the spatially distributed Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model. To maximize the utility of the VIC model, a process-based distributed model, it is calibrated to 24 sub-basins. Snow water equivalent (SWE) decreases at lower elevations primarily in the southern portion of the UCRB and increases progressively at high elevations in the north from the 2020s to the 2050s to the 2080s based on the mean of seven GCMs run under the A2 scenario. Evaporation increases where adequate moisture is available in the summer months out to the 2080s. Runoff increases strongly in winter and spring and increases moderately in fall in the UCRB. Mean annual streamflow is projected to increase twice as fast in the northern, higher elevation, Columbia River basin than in the southern Kootenay River basin.

The Illecillewaet is a glacierized catchment that feeds the Columbia River, with terrain, glacial cover, and topographic relief that are typical of Columbia River headwaters basins in southwestern Canada. Meteorological and mass balance data collected on Illecillewaet Glacier are used to develop and constrain a distributed model for glacier melt, based on temperature and absorbed solar radiation. The melt model is applied to all of the glaciers in the Illecillewaet River basin for the summers of 2009 to 2011. Modelled glacier runoff for the three years has an average value of 112 +/- 12 x 10(6) m(3), approximately 10% of Illecillewaet River yields for 2009 to 2011. Glaciers contributed 25% to August flows for the three years. On average, 66% of modelled glacial discharge is derived from the seasonal snowpack, with the remaining 34% resulting from the melting of glacier ice and firn. For the lowest flow year in the basin, 2009, snow and ice melt from glaciers in the basin contributed 14% and 33%, respectively; 81% of the August glacier runoff is derived from glacier storage (ice and firn). Climate sensitivity studies for Illecillewaet Glacier indicate that the glacier mass balance is strongly influenced by summer temperature, with a net balance change of -0.6 metres of water equivalent (m w.e.) under a 1 degrees C warming.

The study focusses on two characteristics of stream temperature: the thermal regime, defined as the pattern of seasonal and spatial stream temperature variation in a stream, and the thermal sensitivity, considered here to be the slope of the stream-air temperature relationship. The baseflow index, or degree of groundwater influence in a stream, is hypothesized to be an important regional control of both thermal regime and thermal sensitivity. Weekly stream temperatures were calculated and evaluated at 104 primarily unregulated sites that were geographically distributed across the region. Air temperature and streamflow explained an average of 94% of the variance in annual thermal regimes and 68% of the variance in August thermal regimes at individual sites. Regression results showed that thermal sensitivity to increasing air temperatures was less in summer than at other times of the year. Future climate projections of summer stream temperature, based on thermal sensitivities, are small in comparison to the range of summer stream temperatures that exist across the region. This observation highlights the need to understand summer thermal regimes as well as summer thermal sensitivities when assessing climate change impacts to regional stream temperatures. Multiple regression analysis identified several landscape factors and stream characteristics that explained summer stream temperatures and thermal sensitivities regionally. Two of the most important factors were baseflow index and stream channel slope. Lastly, the summer stream/air temperature ratio of a stream may be useful in assessing existing or expected stream temperature conditions at a site in relation to these factors or in identifying unique environmental conditions or potential restoration needs at a site.

Because the stable isotope composition of precipitation can vary geographically, variation in the stable isotope composition of river water may be able to identify source water dynamics. We monitored the stable isotope values (delta O-18 and delta H-2) of river and stream water within the southern Willamette River Basin in western Oregon over two years. Within this basin, eighty-four percent of the isotopic variation in small tributary streams was explained by the mean elevation of the catchments, whereas seasonal variation was minimal. However, water within the Willamette River had distinct isotopic seasonal patterns that likely occurred because of changes in the mean elevation of source water for the river. River isotopic values were lowest during summer low flow and highest during February/March when snow accumulated in the mountains. We estimated that the mean elevation of the source water for the Willamette River shifted over 700 m, seasonally. During winter when rain occurred in the valley and snow accumulated in the mountains, the river reflected a mixture of low mountains and valley bottom precipitation. During the dry Mediterranean summer, 60-80% of the river water came from the snow zone above 1200 m, which is only 12% of the land area and accounts for 15.6% of the annual precipitation within the Willamette Basin.

Three new time series facilitate this analysis: a water-balance estimate of Cascade snowpack from 1930 to 2007 that extends the observational record 20 years earlier than standard snowpack measurements; a radiosonde-based time series of lower-tropospheric temperature during onshore flow, to which Cascade snowpack is well correlated; and a new index of the North Pacific sea level pressure pattern that encapsulates modes of variability to which Cascade spring snowpack is particularly sensitive. Cascade spring snowpack declined 23% during 1930-2007. This loss is nearly statistically significant at the 5% level. The snowpack increased 19% during the recent period of most rapid global warming (1976-2007), though this change is not statistically significant because of large annual variability. From 1950 to 1997, a large and statistically significant decline of 48% occurred. However, 80% of this decline is connected to changes in the circulation patterns over the North Pacific Ocean that vary naturally on annual to interdecadal time scales. The residual time series of Cascade snowpack after Pacific variability is removed displays a relatively steady loss rate of 2.0% decade (1), yielding a loss of 16% from 1930 to 2007. This loss is very nearly statistically significant and includes the possible impacts of anthropogenic global warming. The dates of maximum snowpack and 90% melt out have shifted 5 days earlier since 1930. Both shifts are statistically insignificant.

Understanding the relationships between climate oscillations, drought, and area burned in the past is required for anticipating potential impacts of regional climate change and for effective wildfire-hazard management. These relationships have been investigated for British Columbia (BC), Canada, either as part of national studies with coarse spatial resolution or for single ecosystems. Because of BC's complex terrain and strong climatic gradients, an investigation with higher spatial resolution may allow for a spatially complete but differentiated picture. In this study, we analyzed the annual proportion burned-climate oscillation-drought relationships for the province's 16 Biogeoclimatic Ecosystem Classification (BEC) zones. Analyses are based on a digital, spatially explicit fire database, climate oscillation indices, and monthly precipitation and temperature data with a spatial resolution of 400 m for the period 1920-2000. Results show that (1) fire variability is better related to summer drought than to climate oscillations, and that (2) fire variability is most strongly related to both, climate oscillations and summer drought in southeastern BC. The relationship of area burned and summer drought is strong for lower elevations in western BC as well.

They respond to variations in both accumulation and ablation, which can have separate atmospheric controls, leading to some ambiguity in interpreting the causes of glacier changes. Both climate change and climate variability have characteristic spatial patterns and time scales. The focus of this study is the regional-scale response of glaciers to natural patterns of climate variability. Using the Pacific Northwest of North America as the setting, the authors employ a simple linear glacier model to study how the combination of patterns of melt-season temperature and patterns of annual accumulation produce patterns of glacier length variations. Regional-scale spatial correlations in glacier length variations reflect three factors: the spatial correlations in precipitation and melt-season temperature, the geometry of a glacier and how it determines the relative importance of temperature and precipitation, and the climatic setting of the glaciers (i.e., maritime or continental). With the self-consistent framework developed here, the authors are able to evaluate the relative importance of these three factors. The results also highlight that, in order to understand the natural variability of glaciers, it is critically important to know the small-scale patterns of climate in mountainous terrain. The method can be applied to any area containing mountain glaciers and provides a baseline expectation for natural glacier variation against which the effects of climate changes can be evaluated.",2009,10.1175/2009JCLI2857.1,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,WOS:000269375600010,Courtney,Yes,Yes,Yes,Biome/National,"Pacific Northwest, glaciers",NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Courtney,Yes,Yes,Yes,pnw,

A total of 256 sites were surveyed, of which 216 were randomly selected. All three species were distributed throughout the study area in all three states, and mostly in interior mountain ranges. Only L. rivale was widespread, and both D. nielophylli2lini and P. hydrothyria appear to be rare in the region but can become locally common in some watersheds. All three lichens probably benefit from older streamside forests, but association with forest age was inconclusive at the watershed level. Federal protective land use allocations and Aquatic Conservation Strategy components appear to play a minor role in protecting existing populations for the three aquatic lichens. Climate factors appear to be of major importance to habitat suitability for the three aquatic lichens. Results from this Study suggest the following habitat summaries for the three aquatic lichens. Higher elevation, exposed streams with large rocks or bedrock appear to be important habitat for D. meiophyllizum. This lichen was also often found above the stream water level. Leptogium rivale was found most frequently in shallow, partially shaded streams and submerged or just above the water level. For P. hydrothyria, this study suggests that cool, partially shaded small Mountain streams are important habitat; however, this only appears to be habitat characteristics for this lichen from southern Washington and Southward in the Study area.

To date, the description of nutrient flushing at the catchment scale has been largely mechanistically weak. This paper mechanistically assesses the flushing mechanism of DOC, DON and DIN at the hillslope and catchment scale during two storm events, in a small catchment (WS10), H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest in the western Cascade Mountains of Oregon. Using a combination of natural tracer and hydrometric data, and end-member mixing analysis we were able to describe the exact flushing mechanism at the site. This mechanism involved vertical preferential flow to the soil-bedrock interface and then lateral downslope flow, with a finite source of DOC and DON in the organic horizon. Both specific UV absorbance (SUVA, 254 nm) and continuously measured raw fluorescence measured with a fluorometer increased during the storm events, suggesting DOC was more aromatic during stormflow compared to baseflow conditions. SUVA patterns in lateral subsurface flow from the hillslope and stream water in combination with hydrometric data enabled us to infer that the contribution of deep soil water and groundwater was higher during the falling limb compared to the rising limb of the hydrograph and contributed to the dilution of DOC, DON and SUVA values during storm events. Overall this study showed the value of using a combination of hydrometric data, natural tracer data, and in particular DOC quality indices such as SUVA and fluorescence to mechanistically assess nutrient flushing at the catchment scale.

Climate change models consistently predict snow depth declines across the Northern Hemisphere. Snow depth has been linked to the demography of numerous species, and snow depth reduction is expected to affect the demography of some northern species. As many demographic studies depend on long-term population data that extend back beyond available sources of spatially continuous snow depth data, reliable hindcasting of snow depth surface maps is needed. 2. We developed a two-stage regression modelling approach to reconstructing historic snow depths using an existing and readily available spatiotemporal data set of daily meteorological variables across a large, heterogeneous landscape in North America from 1982 to 2003. The final model accounted for ecoregional differences and predicted snow depth as a function of elevation and total snowfall accumulation. 3. Model validations showed that the estimated snow depths were spatially and temporally accurate. 4. We demonstrate how to apply this model with ArcGIS to hindcast monthly and yearly sequences of high-resolution, spatially continuous surfaces of historic snow depths. We also illustrate the utility of the modelled snow depth surfaces for informing predictions of how changes in snow depth may influence the demography and habitats of snow-dependent and snow-restricted species by assessing the spatiotemporal stochasticity of snow conditions that potentially benefit wolverine Gulo gulo and the winter ranges, net energy costs and population growth of mule deer Odocoileus hemionus. 5. This model can be used to hindcast snow depth surfaces across similar regions; our simple twostage modelling approach can be applied to other regions where equivalent climate data are available. The resulting spatiotemporal snow depth surfaces estimated from this model can be linked to existing long-term wildlife population data sets to investigate the extent to which snow depth declinesmay regulate or limit populations.",2012,10.1111/j.2041-210X.2011.00144.x,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WOS:000299728300009,Danny,Yes,Yes,Yes,Landscape/State-Province,Idaho (Frank Church),NA,,,,,,Micah,Yes,Yes,Yes,ID,Courtney,Yes,Yes,Yes,idaho,

Reducing non-climate stressors and securing protection for large, complex landscapes are important long-term actions to alleviate climate change impacts on biodiversity. Equally important is the immediate protection of a network of climate change microrefugia, particularly old growth and intact forests on north-facing slopes and in canyon bottoms, lower- and middle-elevations, wetter coastal mountains, and along elevational gradients. Such areas provide local opportunities for vulnerable species to persist within the ecoregion. We identify a provisional set of 22 highest-priority and 40 high-priority microrefugia that occur mostly outside of existing protected areas and along wetter and lower elevations of the ecoregion. Proposed reserve designs, if fully implemented, would capture most of the recommended microrefugia, although we found 11 important gaps. Most of the region's biodiversity, endemic species, and species vulnerable to climate change are invertebrates, non-vascular plants, and fungi that are largely restricted to persistently cool and moist late-successional forests. Opportunities for climate change response for vulnerable taxa will necessarily be local due to a limited capacity of many species to move to new habitat, even over relatively small distances where land use practices create inhospitable conditions.

Mountainous landscapes have been shown to be particularly sensitive to climate changes and are likely to experience significant impacts under predicted future climate regimes. Western white pine (Pinus monticola), a five-needle pine species that forms the most diverse of the white pine forest cover types in the western United States, is vulnerable to an interacting suite of threats that includes climate change, fire suppression, white pine blister rust (Cronartium ribicola), and mountain pine beetles (Dendroctonus ponderosae) that have already caused major changes in species distribution and abundance. We used the mechanistic simulation model FireBGCv2 to simulate effects of climate change and fire management on western white pines in a mountainous watershed in Glacier National Park, Montana, USA. Our results suggest that warming temperatures favor increased abundance of western white pine over existing climax and shade tolerant species in the study area, mainly because warmer conditions potentiate fire dynamics, including increased wildfire frequency and extent, which facilitates regeneration. Suppression of wildfires reduced the area dominated by western white pine, but fire suppression was less effective at limiting burned area extent and fire frequency in a warmer and drier climate. Wildfires created canopy gaps that allowed for western white pine regeneration at a high enough rate to escape local extirpation from white pine blister rust. Western white pine appears to be a resilient species even under fairly extreme warming trajectories and shifting fire regimes, and may provide a hedge against vegetation community shifts away from forest types and toward grass and shrublands.",2011,10.3390/f2040832,Forestry,WOS:000208657300002,Danny,Yes,Yes,Yes,Ecosystem/Municipal,"Glacier national park, Selkirks, Canadian CRB",NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Courtney,Yes,Yes,Yes,"Park beetles, glacier np",

We developed a suite of statistical models that related monthly climate data (1972-1999) to the occurrence and size of fires >200 ha in the northern Rocky Mountains; these models were cross-validated and then used with downscaled (similar to 12 km x 12 km) climate projections from three global climate models to predict fire occurrence and area burned in the GYE through 2099. All models predicted substantial increases in fire by midcentury, with fire rotation (the time to burn an area equal to the landscape area) reduced to <30 y from the historical 100-300 y for most of the GYE. Years without large fires were common historically but are expected to become rare as annual area burned and the frequency of regionally synchronous fires increase. Our findings suggest a shift to novel fire-climate-vegetation relationships in Greater Yellowstone by midcentury because fire frequency and extent would be inconsistent with persistence of the current suite of conifer species.

We compared correlations in salmonid density in central Idaho and examined the relationships between changes in salmonid density and the variation in large-scale bioclimatic conditions as indexed by stream flow, air temperature, drought, coastal upwelling, and the number of Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha redds (a surrogate for nutrient influx and therefore increased stream productivity). The average densities of six stream-dwelling salmonid fishes were highly synchronous, with declines from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s followed by a rebound through 2003. All pairwise correlations were positive and 8 of 15 were statistically significant. Stream flow and Chinook salmon redds were correlated with fish densities as a group, but the importance of bioclimatic indices differed by species and varied by the lag times applied. Stream flow 3 and 4 years previous was most important for brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis and bull trout S. confluentus. The presence of Chinook salmon redds from the previous year was most important for Chinook salmon. The coastal upwelling index 4 years previous was most important for mountain whitefish Prosopium williamsoni and steelhead O. mykiss. No variable captured much of the variation in the density of westslope cutthroat trout O. clarkii lewisi. Models based on data from 1985 to 2003 correctly predicted the synchronous declines in fish density observed for all species from 2004 to 2009, suggesting that the bioclimatic indices we chose were useful surrogates for large-scale factors influencing the temporal changes in salmonid densities in central Idaho. For fishery managers, interspecies synchrony may allow a more powerful multispecies approach to monitoring and reveal the tractability of large systems to management control.

The extent that the current distribution of this species may be altered under a changing climate is an important question for managers of wood supply as well as those interested in conservation of subalpine ecosystems. In this paper, we address the question, how much might the current range of the species shift under a changing climate? We first assessed the extent that suboptimal temperature, frost, drought, and humidity deficits affect photosynthesis and growth of the species across the Pacific Northwest with a process-based model (3-PG). We then entered the same set of climatic variables into a decision-tree model, which creates a suite of rules that differentially rank the variables, to provide a basis for predicting presence or absence of the species under current climatic conditions. The derived decision-tree model successfully predicted weighted presence and absence recorded on 12,660 field survey plots with an accuracy of similar to 70%. The analysis indicated that sites with significant spring frost, summer temperatures averaging < 15A degrees C and soils that fully recharged from snowmelt were most likely to support lodgepole pine. Based on these criteria, we projected climatic conditions through the twenty-first century as they might develop without additional efforts to reduce carbon emissions using the Canadian Climate Centre model (CGCM2). In the 30-year period centered around 2020, the area suitable for lodgepole pine in the Pacific Northwest was projected to be reduced only slightly (8%). Thereafter, however, the projected climatic conditions appear to progressively favor other species, so that by the last 30 years of twenty-first century, lodgepole pine could be nearly absent from much of its current range. We conclude that process-based models, because they are highly sensitive to seasonal variation in solar radiation, are well adapted to identify the importance of different climatic variables on photosynthesis and growth. These same variables, once indentified, and run through a decision-tree model, provide a reasonable approach to predict current and future patterns in a species' distribution.",2011,10.1007/s10584-010-9861-2,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,WOS:000287508700016,Danny,Yes,Yes,Yes,Landscape/State-Province,PNW/ BC Dig Deeper,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Courtney,Yes,Yes,Yes,PNW,

However, few studies have quantified impacts on carbon (C) cycling. In this study, we quantified the immediate response and subsequent trajectories of stand-level aboveground tree C stocks and fluxes using field measurements and modeling for a location in central Idaho, USA that experienced an outbreak of mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins). We measured tree characteristics in lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) plots spanning a range of structure and mortality conditions. We then initialized the forest vegetation simulator, an individual tree-based model, with these measurements and simulated the response of aboveground production of C fluxes as well as trajectories of C stocks and fluxes in the coming decades. Mountain pine beetles killed up to 52% of the trees within plots, with more larger trees killed. C stocks in lodgepole pine were reduced by 31-83% following the outbreak, and plot-level C fluxes decreased 28-73%. Modeled C stocks increased nearly continuously following the infestation, recovering to preoutbreak levels in 25 years or less. Simulated aboveground tree C fluxes increased following the immediate postoutbreak decrease, then subsequently declined. Substantial variability of C stocks and fluxes among plots resulted from the number and size of killed and surviving trees. Our study illustrates that bark beetle epidemics alter forest C cycling unlike stand-replacement wildfires or clear-cut harvests, due in part to incomplete mortality coupled with the preference by beetles for larger trees. The dependency of postoutbreak C stocks and fluxes on stand structure suggests that C budget models and studies in areas experiencing mountain pine beetle disturbances need to include size distribution of trees for the most accurate results.",2011,10.1111/j.1365-2486.2010.02226.x,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WOS:000284851500029,Danny,Yes,Yes,Yes,Landscape/State-Province,Saw Tooth National Rec Area,Courtney,Yes,Yes,Yes,Lanscape/State-province,western US pine beetles,NA,,,,,Courtney,Yes,Maybe,Yes,"Central Idaho, content a little questionable",

Well and stream hydrographs are analysed using a series of diagnostic tools including time series plots, hysteresis plots, and cross-correlation plots. Characterizing the seasonal timing of the response requires consideration of the hydroclimatology of the region: rainfall-dominated (pluvial), snowmelt-dominated (nival) or hybrid (mixture of rain and snow). The magnitude and timing of the recharge and discharge response of the groundwater system was shown to depend on the storage and permeability characteristics of the aquifer and whether the system is stream-driven or recharge-driven. These two dominant stream-aquifer system types were defined based on classifying different aquifer types found in the southwest portion of the province. The classification scheme and diagnostic tools have the potential to provide a framework for evaluating the responses of wells in other mountainous regions.

Local climate regimes associated with frequent cold air pooling have substantial impacts on species phenology, distribution and diversity. However, little is known about how the degree and frequency of cold air drainage and pooling will respond to a changing climate. Evidence suggests that, because cold pools are decoupled from the free atmosphere, these local climates may not respond in the same way as regional-scale climates estimated from coarse-grid general circulation models. Indeed, recent studies have demonstrated that historical changes M the frequency of synoptic conditions have produced complex spatial variations in the resulting climatic changes on the ground. In the mountainous terrain of the Oregon Cascades, we show that, at relatively exposed hill slope and ridge top locations, air temperatures are highly coupled to changes in synoptic circulation patterns at the 700-hPa level, whereas in sheltered valley bottoms, cold air pooling at night and during winter causes temperatures to be largely decoupled from, and relatively insensitive to, 700-hPa How variations. The result is a complex temperature landscape composed of steep gradients in temporal variation. controlled largely by gradients in elevation and topographic position. When a projected climate warming of 2.5 degrees C was combined with likely changes in the frequency distribution of synoptic circulation, modelled temperature changes at closely spaced locations diverged widely (by up to 6 degrees C), with differences equalling or exceeding that of the imposed regional temperature change. Because cold air pooling and consequent atmospheric decoupling occur in many mountain valleys, especially at high latitudes. this phenomenon is likely to he an important consideration in understanding the impacts of climate change in mountainous regions.

Second, we use existing analyses of climatic controls on tree species biogeography to demonstrate that by the mid twenty-first century, climate will be less suitable for key species in some areas of Washington. Third, we examine the relationships between climate and the area burned by fire and project climatically driven regional and sub-regional increases in area burned. Fourth, we suggest that climatic change influences mountain pine beetle (MPB) outbreaks by increasing host-tree vulnerability and by shifting the region of climate suitability upward in elevation.

Many studies have drawn the link between local meteorological conditions and glacier mass balance, but these statistical relationships are difficult to extrapolate to other sites or to apply in sensitivity studies of future climate change. In this paper, we explore the ability to predict regional climate anomalies and glacier mass balance in the Canadian Rockies on the basis of 500-mb circulation indices derived from the NCEP-NCAR reanalysis dataset. Daily precipitation amounts and variance-weighted seasonal temperature and precipitation anomalies at a suite of six long-term meteorological stations in the Canadian Rockies (1953-2002) demonstrate a coherent dependence on the daily and mean seasonal atmospheric flow indices. The Peyto Glacier, Alberta, Canada offers the best available mass balance time-series in the Canadian Rockies (1966-2004). Regression models for Peyto Glacier winter, summer, and annual mass balance variability were constructed from (1) Jasper climate anomalies, (2) regional climate anomalies, and (3) atmospheric flow indices. Model performance was examined in terms of the multiple coefficient of determination and of the variables retained in the stepwise regression analysis. Flow indices were the stronger predictors of mass balance. This offers important advantages for mass balance forecasts, because large-scale circulation patterns are better captured than surface weather in mountain regions, in both reanalysed climatology and model-generated climate change scenarios.

Mean monthly temperature anomalies from 1982 to 1999 are examined for 60 SNOTEL and 296 GHCN/CRU sites at elevations over 500 m with relatively homogenous records. The surface/free-air temperature difference Delta T (T-s - T-a) is calculated for both the SNOTEL and GHCN/CRU datasets. Topography influences the correlation between surface and free-air temperature anomalies. Physically realistic diurnal and seasonal changes in Delta T are illustrated. Systematic secular trends in surface temperatures, free-air temperatures, and Delta T are revealed, but the sign and magnitude of change depends on location, meaning that regional signals are weak. The T-s trends are positive for most GHCN and CRU sites, and for SNOTEL sites at night. Daytime cooling in the SNOTEL network reduces the mean daily warming trend. The T-s trends are consistently positive for both networks and are often larger than T-s Thus mean Delta T trends are negative for both datasets. The smaller sample size in the SNOTEL dataset means that error estimates for regional signals are much wider than for the GHCN/CRU dataset. Trend difference maps identify potentially anomalous SNOTEL records. Trends show no correlation with elevation and topography. Surface trends show higher variability and account for most of the uncertainty in Delta T trends. Sensitivity of trends to time period is also discussed.

Variability in snow cover within mountainous regions of the Pacific Northwest, USA is attributable to a combination of anthropogenic climate change and climate oscillations. However, snow covered areas can be heterogeneous and patchy, requiring more detailed mapping of snow trends to understand their potential influences on montane forests. We used standard daily MODIS snow products (MOD10A1.5) to investigate the 15-year record (2000-2014) of snow cover in the predominant forest ecotone of the Oregon Western Cascades. We modeled the ecotone using field data from the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest, and only considered forested MODIS Terra pixels located within the mapped ecotone of a five-county region. Three snow cover metrics were developed using both binary and fractional snow cover data: mean ecotone snow cover percent, number of snow covered days during the melt season, and day of snow disappearance. Snow cover and depletion dates exhibited large interannual variability and no significant linear trends. This variability is likely influenced by the preceding wintertime states of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the El Nino/Southem Oscillation (ENSO), which tend to covary. We improve and generalize existing methods for power analysis of trend estimation and quantify the number of uninterrupted observations of the snow metrics that would be needed to distinguish trends of different magnitudes from noise variance, taking possible autocorrelation into account. Sensitivity analyses of the results to some of our heuristic choices are conducted, and challenges associated with optical remote sensing of snow in a dense montane forest are discussed.

Because of their unique biology, lichens are very sensitive bioindicators of air quality. Lichens lack a cuticle to control absorption or leaching of nutrients and they dynamically concentrate nutrients roughly in proportion to the abundance in the atmosphere. As N deposition increases, nitrogen-loving eutrophic lichens become dominant over oligotrophic lichens that thrive in nutrient-poor habitats. We capitalize on these characteristics to develop two lichen-based indicators of air-borne and depositional N for interior forested mountain ecosystems of the Pacific Northwest and calibrate them with N concentration measured in PM2.5 at 12 IMPROVE air quality monitoring sites in the study area. The two lichen indices and peak frequencies of individual species exhibited continuous relationships with inorganic N pollution throughout the range of N in ambient PM2.5, suggesting that the designation of a critical level or critical load is somewhat arbitrary because at any level above background, some species are likely to experience adverse impacts. The concentration of N in PM2.5 near the city of Spokane, Washington was the lowest measured at an instrumented monitoring site near known N pollution sources. This level, 0.37 mu g/m(3)/year, served as a critical level, corresponding to a concentration of 1.02% N in the lichen Letharia vulpina, which is similar to the upper end of background lichen N concentrations measured elsewhere in the western United States. Based on this level, we estimate critical loads to be 1.54 and 2.51 kg/ha/year of through-fall dissolved inorganic N deposition for lichen communities and lichen N concentration, respectively. We map estimated fine-particulate (PM2.5) N in ambient air based on lichen community and lichen N concentration indices to identify hotspots in the region. We also develop and map an independent lichen community-based bioclimatic index, which is strongly related to gradients in moisture availability and temperature variability. Lichen communities in the driest climates were more eutrophic than those in wetter climates at the same levels of N air pollution.

The Point Arena subspecies (A. r. nigra) is federally listed as endangered and is 1 of 2 subspecies that have extremely small and disjunct distributions, putting the taxon at risk from habitat loss and warming global temperatures. We sought to understand their range-wide distribution, to predict the environmental features that best describe their occurrence, and to establish a foundation for monitoring their distribution. We randomly sampled the occurrence of Point Arena mountain beavers (PAMB) from the portion of their geographic range that was accessible (public lands plus private lands where permission was granted). We surveyed 127, 25-ha sample units for their distinctive burrows and estimated the probability of detecting burrows, if they were present, at >90% per visit. Using this information, we estimated occupancy across the accessible portion of the range to be 26.2%. Range-wide estimates of occupancy, combined with strategically selected locations where abundance and survival can be estimated noninvasively, may comprise a realistic monitoring program for this taxon. We also used the detection and nondetection locations to develop a habitat suitability model by relating these locations to remotely sensed predictors. We evaluated 53 a priori candidate habitat suitability models and the best-fitting model included gentle slopes, low terrain roughness indices, and the high density of rivers and streams. Selecting the probability value that best separated the sample units into suitable and nonsuitable habitat, we estimated a total of 70.5 km(2) of suitable habit, or approximately 40.4% of the original geographic range. New detections significantly expanded the known geographic range, moderating concerns about habitat loss, including that predicted by climate change. A substantial number of suitable areas were predicted to occur outside the current range. The identification of high suitability areas allows management agencies to prioritize areas for PAMB conservation planning, evaluate human impacts on habitat, and evaluate how a changing climate may affect distribution.",2015,10.1093/jmammal/gyv039,Zoology,WOS:000354249300013,Micah,No,No,No,,CA,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Courtney,Yes,Yes,Yes,general PNW,

These ecotones represent upper and lower distribution edges of two species, and span the distribution interior of the third species. Our results indicate a greater influence of climate (i.e., temperature and precipitation) than crowding on radial growth.

In addition, the effects of climate changes on ecosystem structure and function are often modulated or delayed, meaning that short-term experiments are not sufficient to characterize ecosystem responses. This study capitalized on a long-term reciprocal soil transplant experiment to examine the response of dryland soils to climate change. The two transplant sites were separated by 500 m of elevation on the same mountain slope in eastern Washington state, USA, and had similar plant species and soil types. We resampled the original 1994 soil transplants and controls, measuring CO2 production, temperature response, enzyme activity, and bacterial community structure after 17 years. Over a laboratory incubation of 100 days, reciprocally transplanted soils respired roughly equal cumulative amounts of carbon as non-transplanted controls from the same site. Soils transplanted from the hot, dry, lower site to the cooler and wetter (difference of -5 degrees C monthly maximum air temperature, +50 mm yr(-1) precipitation) upper site exhibited almost no respiratory response to temperature (Q(10) of 1.1), but soils originally from the upper, cooler site had generally higher respiration rates. The bacterial community structure of transplants did not differ significantly from that of untransplanted controls, however. Slight differences in local climate between the upper and lower Rattlesnake locations, simulated with environmental control chambers during the incubation, thus prompted significant differences in microbial activity, with no observed change to bacterial structure.

Here, the impact of forcing data availability on snow model output is assessed with data-withholding experiments using 3-yr datasets at well-instrumented sites in four climates. The interplay between forcing availability and model complexity is examined among the Utah Energy Balance (UEB), the Distributed Hydrology Soil Vegetation Model (DHSVM) snow submodel, and the snow thermal model (SNTHERM). Sixty-four unique forcing scenarios were evaluated, with different assumptions regarding availability of hourly meteorological observations at each site. Modeled snow water equivalent (SWE) and snow surface temperature T-surf diverged most often because of availability of longwave radiation, which is the least frequently measured forcing in cold regions in the western United States. Availability of longwave radiation (i.e., observed vs empirically estimated) caused maximum SWE differences up to 234 mm (57% of peak SWE), mean differences up to 6.2 degrees C in T-surf, and up to 32 days difference in snow disappearance timing. From a model data perspective, more common observations of longwave radiation at AWSs could benefit snow model development and applications, but other aspects (e.g., costs, site access, and maintenance) need consideration.",2016,10.1175/JHM-D-14-0235.1,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,WOS:000367402700004,Paris,Yes,Yes,Yes,plot/family/group,"Reynolds Creek, ID\one of a series of plots.

Regional connectivity of many terrestrial and aquatic habitats is fragmented, flows of some ecological and physical processes have been altered in space and time, and the frequency, size and intensity of many disturbances that configure these habitats have been altered. Current efforts to address these impacts yield a small footprint in comparison to wildfires and insect outbreaks. Moreover, many current projects emphasize thinning and fuels reduction within individual forest stands, while overlooking large-scale habitat connectivity and disturbance flow issues. Methods We provide a framework for landscape restoration, offering seven principles. We discuss their implication for management, and illustrate their application with examples. Results Historical forests were spatially heterogeneous at multiple scales. Heterogeneity was the result of variability and interactions among native ecological patterns and processes, including successional and disturbance processes regulated by climatic and topographic drivers. Native flora and fauna were adapted to these conditions, which conferred a measure of resilience to variability in climate and recurrent contagious disturbances. Conclusions To restore key characteristics of this resilience to current landscapes, planning and management are needed at ecoregion, local landscape, successional patch, and tree neighborhood scales. Restoration that works effectively across ownerships and allocations will require active thinking about landscapes as socio-ecological systems that provide services to people within the finite capacities of ecosystems.

A major realization is that accumulated physiological stress can ultimately lead to tree mortality and changes in species distributions, particularly in areas away from maritime influences. To ameliorate the effects of drought, insect outbreaks, and reduce the risk of crown fires, various strategies are being tested. To make some of these strategies economical, biomass is proposed as an alternative energy source. At the same time that an increase in harvesting is being considered, there is a desire to increase carbon sequestration by forests to offset, at least in part, greenhouse gas emissions. Assessments are needed to determine current and future impacts of climate change, and to evaluate management options while considering carbon storage benefits and sustainability of ecosystem structure and function. Here we provide an overview of research results from the Pacific Northwest region where forests dominate the landscape and contain among the highest biomass on earth. In this review, we present findings that challenge common assumptions, and suggest a way to predict outcomes of changes in climate and land management in the future. The approach includes the use of observation-driven land system models that integrate the extent that forests are vulnerable to climate change, management practices, and economic considerations. It also requires increased emphasis on in situ and remotely sensed observations and experiments to initialize and test the model, and to track trends in forest condition. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The effects of climate change may be particularly large in mountainous regions where climate can vary significantly with elevation. Understanding potential future vegetation changes in these regions requires methods that can resolve vegetation responses to climate change at fine spatial resolutions. We used LPJ, a dynamic global vegetation model, to assess potential future vegetation changes for a large topographically complex area of the northwest United States and southwest Canada (38.0-58.0 degrees N latitude by 136.6-103.0 degrees W longitude). LPJ is a process-based vegetation model that mechanistically simulates the effect of changing climate and atmospheric CO2 concentrations on vegetation. It was developed and has been mostly applied at spatial resolutions of 10-minutes or coarser. In this study, we used LPJ at a 30-second (similar to 1-km) spatial resolution to simulate potential vegetation changes for 2070-2099. LPJ was run using downscaled future climate simulations from five coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (CCSM3, CGCM3.1(T47), GISS-ER, MIROC3.2(medres), UKMO-HadCM3) produced using the A2 greenhouse gases emissions scenario. Under projected future climate and atmospheric CO2 concentrations, the simulated vegetation changes result in the contraction of alpine, shrub-steppe, and xeric shrub vegetation across the study area and the expansion of woodland and forest vegetation. Large areas of maritime cool forest and cold forest are simulated to persist under projected future conditions. The fine spatial-scale vegetation simulations resolve patterns of vegetation change that are not visible at coarser resolutions and these fine-scale patterns are particularly important for understanding potential future vegetation changes in topographically complex areas.",2015,10.1371/journal.pone.0138759,Science & Technology - Other Topics,WOS:000363248400010,Paris,Yes,Yes,Yes,Landscape/State-Province,"PNW, Includes Idaho and Salmon River basin",NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Courtney,Yes,Yes,Yes,general climate model of PNW,

Those sensitivities were quantified using the kappa statistic. Simulated vegetation in the western United States was sensitive to changes in atmospheric CO2 concentrations, with woody biome types replacing less woody types throughout the domain.

Long-tenri reconstructions of Holocene fire regimes, provided by the analysis of charcoal, pollen, and other fire proxies in a network of lake records, indicate that the Pacific Northwest and summer-dry regions of the northern Rocky Mountains experienced their highest fire activity in the early Holocene (11,000-7000 years ago) and during the Medieval Warm Period (ca. 1000 years ago) when drought conditions were more severe than today. In contrast, in summer-wet areas of the northern Rocky Mountains, the period of highest fire activity was registered in the last 7000 years when dry woodland vegetation developed. When synthesized across the entire northwestern US, the paleoecological record reveals that past and present fire regimes are strongly controlled by climate changes occurring on multiple time scales. The scarcity of fires in the 20th century in some northwestern US ecosystems may be the result of successful fire suppression policies, but in wetter forests this absence is consistent with long-term fire regime patterns. In addition, simulations of potential future climate and vegetation indicate that future fire conditions in some parts of the northwestern US could be more severe than they are today. The Holocene record of periods of intensified summer drought is used to assess the nature of future fire-climate-vegetation linkages in the region. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Thus, the ecosystem processes controlling these pools are central to understanding the transfers of carbon (C) between the atmosphere and terrestrial systems. To examine these ecosystem processes, the effect of stand age on temporal carbon source-sink relationships was examined in 20-year-old, 40-year-old and old-growth stands of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) in the Cascade Mountains of south-central Washington State. Belowground C and nitrogen (N) storage and soil respiration were measured. In addition, nylon mesh bags containing homogenized soils from each site were buried at the respective sites to quantify root ingrowth and potential C sequestration and loss. The sites supporting the 20- and 40-year-old stands had soil C stores reflecting the C contributions from logging residue, coarse woody debris and stumps left after harvest. Because the N-fixer red alder (Alnus rubra Bong.) comprised 33% of the 40-year-old stand, this site had significantly greater concentrations and pools of N in the forest floor than sites without red alder. This N-rich site had consistently lower soil CO(2) efflux rates during the growing season than the sites supporting the 20-year-old and old-growth stands. Estimated annual soil C efflux was 1367, 883 and 1194 g m(-2) for the sites supporting the 20-, 40- and old-growth stands, respectively. These values are higher than previously reported values. Root ingrowth was significantly less in the 40-year-old stand than in the 20-year-old stand, and both young stands showed markedly less fine root growth than the old-growth stand. At the sites supporting the young stands, C and N were lost from the soil bags, whereas there was an increase in C and N in the soil bags at the site supporting the old-growth stand. The fine root growth and soil respiration data support the hypothesis that belowground C allocation decreases with increasing fertility. Quantification of the source-sink relationship of soil C at the three stands based on litterfall, relative root ingrowth and soil respiration measurements was compromised because of significant CO(2) flux from decaying organic matter in the young stands.",2002,,Forestry,WOS:000173913200014,Shana,Maybe,Maybe,No,,Cascades,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Courtney,Yes,Maybe,Yes,Climate change qualities questionable,

To bridge the gap between what is required and what is resolved, we propose a subgrid-scale parameterization of the influence of topography on clouds, precipitation, and land surface hydrology. The parameterization represents subgrid variations in surface elevation in terms of probability distributions of discrete elevation classes. Separate cloud, radiative, and surface processes are calculated for each elevation class. Rainshadow effects are not treated by the parameterization; they have to be explicitly resolved by the host model. The simulated surface temperature, precipitation, and snow cover for each elevation class are distributed to different geographical locations according to the spatial distribution of surface elevation within each grid cell. The subgrid parameterization has been implemented in the Pacific Northwest Laboratory's climate version of the Penn State/NCAR Mesoscale Model. The scheme is evaluated by driving the regional climate model with observed lateral boundary conditions for the Pacific Northwest and comparing simulated fields with surface observations.

However, monitoring the location of the tree line position and potential movement is difficult due to cost and technical challenges, as well as a lack of a clear boundary. Advanced remote sensing technologies such as Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) offer significant potential to map short individual tree crowns within the transition zone despite the lack of predictive capacity. Process-based forest growth models offer a complementary approach by quantifying the environmental stresses trees experience at the tree line, allowing transition zones to be defined and ultimately mapped. In this study, we investigate the role remote sensing and physiological, ecosystem-based modeling can play in the delineation of the alpine tree line. To do so, we utilize airborne LiDAR data to map tree height and stand density across a series of altitudinal gradients from below to above the tree line within the Swiss National Park (SNP), Switzerland. We then utilize a simple process-based model to assess the importance of seasonal variations on four climatically related variables that impose non-linear constraints on photosynthesis. Our results indicate that all methods predict the tree line to within a 50m altitudinal zone and indicate that aspect is not a driver of significant variations in tree line position in the region. Tree cover, rather than tree height is the main discriminator of the tree line at higher elevations. Temperatures in fall and spring are responsible for the major differences along altitudinal zones, however, changes in evaporative demand also control plant growth at lower altitudes. Our results indicate that the two methods provide complementary information on tree line location and, when combined, provide additional insights into potentially endangered forest/grassland transition zones.",2013,10.1111/gcb.12319,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WOS:000326836000021,Adrienne,No,Yes,No,,,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Danny,No,,International,,

The results show that a warming climate over the basins induces a decrease in mean annual runoff, a shift to earlier snow melting in mountainous areas and more severe low-flow conditions. The simulations show a decrease in electricity generation. Under two water management scenarios (one business-as-usual and the other incorporating an increased downstream water demand in compliance with requirements for increased minimum flow), simulations for the Ariege River basin suggest an earlier filling of the reservoir is necessary in winter to anticipate the increased release from reservoirs in summer to support minimum flow farther downstream.

Similar fire histories are reconstructed from these three approaches for boreal lake sediment cores, using locally defined thresholds. Here, we test the same approach for a montane Mediterranean lake in which taphonomical processes might differ from boreal lakes through fragmentation of charcoal particles. The Mediterranean charcoal series are characterized by highly variable charcoal accumulation rates. Results there indicate that the three proxies do not provide comparable fire histories. The differences are attributable to charcoal fragmentation. This could be linked to fire type (crown or surface fires) or taphonomical processes, including charcoal transportation in the catchment area or in the sediment. The lack of correlation between the concentration of charcoal and of mineral matter suggests that fragmentation is not linked to erosion. Reconstructions based on charcoal area are more robust and stable than those based on fragment counts. Area-based reconstructions should therefore be used instead of the particle-counting method when fragmentation may influence the fragment abundance. (C) 2013 University of Washington.

Together with a quantitative chironomid-based reconstruction of mean July air temperature, these data provide evidence of Holocene climate variability in the western sector of the Russian Subarctic. The results suggest that the amplitude of climate change was more pronounced in the interior mountain area than near the White Sea coast. A chironomid-based temperature reconstruction reflects a warming trend in the early Holocene, interrupted by a transient cooling at ca. 8500-8000 cal yr BP with a maximum drop in temperature (ca. 1 degrees C) around 8200 cal yr BP. The regional Holocene Thermal Maximum, characterized by maximum warmth and dryness occurred at ca. 7900-5400 cal yr BP. During this period, July temperatures were at least 1 C higher than at present. The relatively warm and dry climate persisted until ca. 4000 cal yr BP, when a pronounced neoglacial cooling was initiated. Minimum temperatures, ca. 1-2 degrees C lower than at present, were inferred at ca. 3200-3000 cal yr BP. Faunal shifts in the stratigraphic profile imply also that the late-Holocene cooling was followed by a general increase in effective moisture. (C) 2013 University of Washington.

Driven by these climate change scenarios, a distributed macro-scale hydrological model (the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model) was applied to assess the impact of climate change on hydrological processes in the headwater catchment (HC) of the Tarim River basin, China. The results showed that the HC tends to experience warmer and drier conditions under the combined climate change scenarios. The predictions show a decreasing trend of the runoff in the HC, driven by the combined climate change scenarios. The results predicted an increasing trend for winter runoff however, which was consistent with the forecasts from most previous studies on other locations such as the region of St Lawrence tributaries (Quebec, Canada) and the Willamette River Basin (Oregon, USA).

This study demonstrates that the connectivity between glacial sediment production and downstream sediment fluxes during deglacierization is significantly reduced by the development of proglacial lakes. Suspended and solute sediment fluxes from the proglacial zone of the retreating Obersulzbachkees glacier, Hohe Tauern, Austria, were quantified within a 20 months monitoring period from January 1st 2010 to September 28th 2011. The landsystem is influenced by a proglacial lake (similar to 95 x 10(3) m(2) and >2 x 10(6) m(3)) that hampers sediment output from similar to 18.7 km(2) of the study area. Suspended sediment concentrations (SSC) and solute concentrations (SO C) measured downstream of the proglacial lake were in the range of 71.3 to 702.3 mg/l (empty set SSC <200 mg/l) and 3.58 to 8.33 mg/l (empty set 0 5.56 mg/l) respectively and both are considered to be low. It could be shown by systematic up- and downstream sampling that the proglacial lake reduced SSCs by 88-95 %. However, the lake prevented considerable decrease of SSCs at very low discharge and temporally extended the delivery of higher SSCs when the lake's suspended sediment budget was elevated by external forcing (e.g. rain fall induced hillslope sediment supply). In these situations the lake changed from a sink to a temporal source. It is assumed that bed load was negligible for the duration of this study because the present day bed load transport system is interrupted and supply limited. A total sediment discharge of 18170 +/- 194 t to 18399 +/- 212 t was calculated depending on the calculation method used. Suspended load accounted for 98% and similar to 77 % of the solute load probably originated from chemical weathering. Temporally, the majority of sediment was exported in the ablation seasons (94% SSL and 88% SOL). The overall mass exported corresponds to an average annual specific sediment yield in the range of 451 +/- 5 t/km(2)/a to 457 +/- 5 t/km(2)/a. The results indicate that the Obersulzbachkees proglacial zone is a supply limited system with respect to both bed load and suspended sediment load. It is expected that the number of proglacial lakes will rise within the Alps following accelerated glacial retreat. Hence, sediment delivery from glacial valleys will most likely be significantly altered in the near future, leading to changes in sediment flux of Alpine streams with impacts on hydrology, river ecology and reservoir management.",2013,10.1127/0372-8854/2012/S-00122,Physical Geography; Geology,WOS:000323295900003,Becky,No,Yes,No,,Austria,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Danny,No,,International,,

Finally, the precipitous drop in dust rain over Antarctica and the Southern Ocean terminated as did a similar drop in the C-13 to C-12 ratio in atmospheric CO2. These changes are consistent with a southward shift of the thermal equator. The cause of such a shift is thought to be an expansion of sea ice caused by a shutdown in deep water production in the northern Atlantic.

The present study is the extraction of Glacio-geomorphological unit of Tons River basin based on the visual interpretation of remote sensing data. It was very much difficult in field, to extract all glacio-geomorphological units in glaciated area, but based on the remote sensing data, it becomes easy to identify.

For more than one decade (1999-2009), we monitored the bumblebee fauna of a mountain hotspot in the Eastern Pyrenees. We sampled each year, in July, the same hayfield habitat, resulting in the sampling of 28 species. We computed the correlation of the yearly abundance of the main species with several climatic parameters concerning temperature and precipitation. We separated the parameters measured during the bumblebee solitary phase and those measured during their social phase. Bumblebee fauna composition varied significantly over years. In the 13 species considered, the abundance of 9 was correlated with at least one climatic parameter. The lowest abundance of bumblebees was correlated with hot and dry conditions during the month of August the year before sampling (the nuptial time of the founders). The highest overall abundance of bumblebees was observed during the social phase in the rainy months. Across years, climatic parameters seem to have strongly affected the composition of bumblebee fauna.

Temperate old-growth forests have some of the highest above ground stores of carbon of any forest types on Earth. Unlike tropical forests, the ecology of many temperate forests is dominated by episodic disturbance, such as high intensity fire. An exemplar of a particularly carbon dense temperate forest system adapted to infrequent catastrophic fires is the Eucalyptus regnans forests of south eastern Australia. Knowledge of the growth and longevity of old-growth trees is crucial to understanding the carbon balance and fire regimes of these forest systems. In an old-growth E. regnans stand in the Styx Valley in southern Tasmania we used dendrochronological techniques and radiocarbon dating to determine the age and stem growth of E. regnans and Phyllocladus aspleniifolius, an understorey rainforest conifer. Our analysis revealed that an even-aged cohort of E. regnans and P. aspleniifolius established in 1490-1510AD, apparently after a stand-replacing fire. The stem growth rates of E. regnans in the first 100 years were very rapid compared to the co-occurring P. aspleniifolius. That the longevity of E. regnans is >500 years challenges the suggested 350-450 year timeframe proposed for the widely held model of succession from eucalypt to rainforest. These forests not only have the potential to store vast amounts of carbon, but can also maintain these high carbon densities for a long period of time. Estimates of the capacity of these forests to sequester and store carbon should explicitly consider past harvesting and fire regimes and the potential increases in the risk of fire associated with climate change.

In this paper, hierarchical modeling is used to obtain robust indexes of the annual fluctuations of runout altitudes. The proposed model includes a possible level shift, and distinguishes common large-scale signals in both mean- and high-magnitude events from the interannual variability. Application to the data available in France over the last 61 winters shows that the mean runout altitude is not different now than it was 60 yr ago, but that snow avalanches have been retreating since 1977. This trend is of particular note for high-magnitude events, which have seen their probability rates halved, a crucial result in terms of hazard assessment. Avalanche control measures, observation errors, and model limitations are insufficient explanations for these trends. On the other hand, strong similarities in the pattern of behavior of the proposed runout indexes and several climate datasets are shown, as well as a consistent evolution of the preferred flow regime.

A comparison of this lake-level record with a solar irradiance record supports the hypothesis of a solar forcing of variations in the hydrological cycle linked to climatic oscillations over the last millennium in west-central Europe, with higher lake levels during the solar minimums of Oort (around AD 1060), Wolf (around AD 1320), Sporer (around AD 1450), Maunder (around AD 1690), and Dalton (around AD 1820). Further comparisons of the Saint-Point record with the fluctuations of the Great Aletsch Glacier (Swiss Alps) and a record of Rhone River floods from Lake Bourget (French Alps) give evidence of possible imprints of proxy sensitivity on reconstructed paleohydrological records. In particular, the Great Aletsch record shows an increasing glacier mass from AD 1350 to 1850, suggesting a cumulative effect of the Little Ice Age cooling and/or a possible reflection of a millennial-scale general cooling until the mid-19th century in the Northern Hemisphere. In contrast, the Saint-Point and Bourget records show a general trend toward a decrease in lake levels and in flood magnitude anti-correlated with generally increasing solar irradiance.

These trials illustrated that material from the coast of Oregon and California grew faster than other provenances tested. Further collections were made to evaluate provenance and family-level performance from these two areas, and in 1996 additional trials were established at four low-altitude sites across New Zealand. Genotype x environment (GxE) interaction among these sites was found to be important for diameter at breast height (DBH), less important for stem straightness and malformation and not important for outerwood acoustic velocity (a surrogate for wood stiffness). Heritabilities were low to moderate for all growth traits, and very low for malformation. Heritability for needle cast due to Swiss needle cast, measured as needle retention on the one site where infection was relatively high, was moderate at 0.37, and was likely a major factor creating GxE interactions for growth among sites. The heritability of wood acoustic velocity was moderate to high at individual sites (0.26-0.74) and across sites (0.49). Individual-trait selection revealed the potential for good genetic gains to be made when selecting the top 20 families for diameter growth (an average of 10.7%), straightness (an average of 11.5%) and acoustic velocity (an average of 7.0%). When we examined predicted genetic gains while selecting for needle retention and/or DBH, we found that selecting for needle cast at the affected site did not compromise DBH gains at that site. Selecting for genotypes with low needle cast at the affected site did, however, reduce gains for DBH estimated across all sites. In order to maximise gains across the current Douglas-fir growing estate, a division of growing sites between those known and predicted to be affected by needle cast and those not affected would seem appropriate. This is particularly relevant given recent climate modelling work suggests that Swiss needle cast will become more important in the South Island, and even more destructive in the North Island of New Zealand.

The pollen record shows a progressive aridification since 7000 cal yr BP that occurred in two steps, first shown by a decrease in Pinus, replaced by Poaceae from 7000 to 4600 cal yr BP and then by Cyperaceae, Artemisia and Amaranthaceae from 4600 to 1200 cal yr BP. Pediastrum also decreased progressively and totally disappeared at ca. 3000 yr ago. The progressive aridification is punctuated by periodically enhanced drought at ca. 6500, 5200 and 4000 cal yr BP that coincide in timing and duration with well-known dry events in the Mediterranean and other areas. Since 1200 cal yr BP, several changes are observed in the vegetation that probably indicate the high-impact of humans in the Sierra Nevada, with pasturing leading to nutrient enrichment and eutrophication of the bog, Pinus reforestation and Olea cultivation at lower elevations.

This paper provides a systematic documentation of high-magnitude erosion events after wildfire in south-east Australia, focusing on small (<5 km(2)), upland catchments in eastern Victoria that were burnt by wildfire between 2003 and 2009. The aims of the study were to i) collect and show evidence of debris flow occurrence after wildfire; ii) quantify erosion rates from debris flows and; iii) identify rainfall thresholds and key hydrological properties. The result showed that 13 out of the 16 recorded high-magnitude erosion events were runoff generated debris flows. These occurred in dry eucalypt forests burnt at high or very high severity in steep headwater catchments throughout the eastern uplands of Victoria. The debris flows were triggered by intense, short duration rainfall events (I-30 35-59 mm h(-1)) with annual exceedance probability in the order of 20%. This is the first paper to document the occurrence of post-fire runoff generated debris flows in Australia, so the discussion draws on literature from the western USA, where a large body of research has been dedicated to evaluating the risk posed by post-fire debris flows and their role in landscape processes. Typical features common to both systems include low infiltration capacity of burnt catchments; widespread sheet erosion and levee lined rills on steep upper hillslopes; and severe channel erosion initiated in response to convergent flow in previously un-scoured drainage lines. The depth of sheet erosion on surveyed slopes in the upper catchments (4.6 +/- 0.96 mm to 18.4 +/- 2.7 mm) indicates that hillslope material provides an important source of sediment. The average channel entrainment rate of three debris flows ranged from 0.6 to 1.4 m(3) m(-1). Runoff generated debris flows were not recorded in wet or damp forest types suggesting that this process is unlikely to operate in these forest environments. One isolated case of mass failure generated debris flow was recorded in wet forest. The outcome of the study indicates that runoff generated debris flows in dry eucalypt forest are an important process to be considered during post-fire risk assessment of hydrological hazards.

A review of the global altitudinal distribution of reptiles identified a diverse range of patterns driven by climate and taxonomy. No Australian examples were included in this analysis. We addressed this gap by surveying the reptile assemblage along an altitude gradient from upland rainforest (similar to 1000 m) through to open savanna woodlands (similar to 350 m) in north-eastern Australia. Reptiles were sampled on four separate occasions between May 2006 and November 2007. Thirty-six species, representing seven families, were recorded along the gradient. As we used only diurnal active searching, snakes and nocturnal geckoes were probably under-sampled; thus we considered only lizards in the analysis of altitude pattern. Lizard species richness peaked at the mid-altitudes (600-900 m, 11-12 spp.) and abundance highest at the lower (<500 m) and higher (>800 m) zones. This pattern is likely a factor of both the increase in radiant heat sources (reduced canopy cover) and increased species packing due to the diversity of niches available (presence of rock cover and increase in saxicolous species). In the lower-altitude sites the high abundance of few species seems linked to the dominance of disturbance-tolerant species. We conclude that lizard richness and abundance patterns on this transect are not necessarily exhibiting a mid-domain effect, but instead are a function of species-specific ecological and habitat requirements.",2011,10.1071/ZO11036,Zoology,WOS:000295633500004,Danny,No,No,No,Landscape/State-Province,Australia,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Danny,No,,International,,

Maximum winter stream temperatures are mainly controlled by elevation, catchment area and hill shading, whereas the maximum temperatures in summer are driven by more complex interactions, which include the influence of riparian forest cover and distance to coast. Multiple linear regression was used to estimate the catchment-wide distribution of mean weekly maximum stream temperatures for the hottest week of the 2-year observation period. The results suggested the streams most sensitive to high temperatures are small upland streams at exposed locations without any forest cover and relatively far inland, while lowland streams with riparian forest cover at locations closer to the coast exhibit a moderated thermal regime. Under current conditions, all streams provide a suitable thermal habitat for both, Atlantic salmon and brown trout. Using two climate change scenarios assuming 2.5 and 4 degrees C air temperature increases, respectively, temperature-sensitive zones of the stream network were identified, which could potentially have an adverse effect on the thermal habitat of Atlantic salmon and brown trout. Analysis showed that the extension of riparian forests into headwater streams has the potential to moderate changes in temperature under climate change. Copyright.

The main objective of this study was to quantify the differences between a simplified hydrological model, which uses only precipitation and temperature to compute the hydrological balance when simulating the impact of climate change, and an enhanced version of the model, which solves the energy balance to compute the actual evapotranspiration. For the meteorological forcing of future scenario, at-site bias-corrected time series based on two regional climate models were used. A quantile-based error-correction approach was used to downscale the regional climate model simulations to a point scale and to reduce its error characteristics.

The applied techniques must be adapted to the dynamic conditions of cryospheric environments, and so there is no ideal general technique, and depending on the characteristics of the geomorphological structure to be studied, different geomatic techniques can be used. However, there are situations in which certain instruments cannot be used: global positioning system-real time kinematics shows difficulties when the presence of vertical walls cause a multipath' effect.

The question is, however, how long this effect lasts and how important it is compared to rainfall inputs. Here we investigate the relative importance of snow accumulation on one critical aspect of runoff, namely the summer low flow. This is especially relevant as the expected increase of air temperature might result in decreased snow storage. A decrease of snow will affect soil and ground-water storages during spring and might cause low streamflow values in the subsequent warm season. To understand these potential climate change impacts, a better evaluation of the effects of inter-annual variations in snow accumulation on summer low flow under current conditions is central. The objective in this study was (1) to quantify how long snowmelt affects runoff after melt-out and (2) to estimate the sensitivity of catchments with different elevation ranges to changes in snowpack. To find suitable predictors of summer low flow we used long time series from 14 Alpine and pre-Alpine catchments in Switzerland and computed different variables quantifying winter and spring snow conditions. In general, the results indicated that maximum winter snow water equivalent (SWE) influenced summer low flow, but could expectedly only partly explain the observed inter-annual variations. On average, a decrease of maximum SWE by 10% caused a decrease of minimum discharge in July by 6-9% in catchments higher than 2000 ma.s.l. This effect was smaller in middle-and lower-elevation catchments with a decrease of minimum discharge by 2-5% per 10% decrease of maxi-mum SWE. For higher-and middle-elevation catchments and years with below-average SWE maximum, the minimum discharge in July decreased to 70-90% of its normal level. Additionally, a reduction in SWE resulted in earlier low-flow occurrence in some cases. One other important factor was the precipitation between maximum SWE and summer low flow. When only dry preceding conditions in this period were considered, the importance of maximum SWE as a predictor of low flows increased. We assessed the sensitivity of individual catchments to the change of maximum SWE using the non-parametric Theil-Sen approach as well as an elasticity index. Both sensitivity indicators increased with increasing mean catchment elevation, indicating a higher sensitivity of summer low flow to snow accumulation in Alpine catchments compared to lower-elevation pre-Alpine catchments.",2016,10.5194/hess-20-859-2016,Geology; Water Resources,WOS:000377697600018,Paris,No,Yes,No,,Switz,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Danny,No,Maybe,International,,

For example, riparian woodland is advocated widely as shade to reduce warming in temperate streams, but few studies have considered collateral effects on species composition or ecosystem functions. Here, we use cross-sectional analyses at two scales (region and within streams) to investigate whether four types of riparian management, including those proposed to reduce potential climate change impacts, might also affect the composition, functional character, dynamics and energetic resourcing of macroinvertebrates in upland Welsh streams (UK). Riparian land use across the region had only small effects on invertebrate taxonomic composition, while stable isotope data showed how energetic resources assimilated by macroinvertebrates in all functional guilds were split roughly 50:50 between terrestrial and aquatic origins irrespective of riparian management. Nevertheless, streams draining the most extensive deciduous woodland had the greatest stocks of coarse particulate matter (CPOM) and greater numbers of shredding' detritivores. Stream-scale investigations showed that macroinvertebrate biomass in deciduous woodland streams was around twice that in moorland streams, and lowest of all in streams draining non-native conifers. The unexpected absence of contrasting terrestrial signals in the isotopic data implies that factors other than local land use affect the relative incorporation of allochthonous subsidies into riverine food webs. Nevertheless, our results reveal how planting deciduous riparian trees along temperate headwaters as an adaptation to climate change can modify macroinvertebrate function, increase biomass and potentially enhance resilience by increasing basal resources where cover is extensive (>60m riparian width). We advocate greater urgency in efforts to understand the ecosystem consequences of climate change adaptation to guide future actions.",2016,10.1111/gcb.13103,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WOS:000367982900025,Paris,No,Yes,No,,Wales,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Danny,No,Maybe,International,,

These populations are isolated in high mountains, which tends to protect them from the attack of a severe defoliating Mediterranean pest, the pine processionary moth Thaumetopoea pityocampa. However, as a consequence of climate change, the pine processionary caterpillar has increasingly attacked populations of this pine in recent years. This work describes the detrimental effects of defoliation by the pine processionary caterpillar in P. sylvestris subsp. nevadensis in Sierra Nevada. Defoliation strongly reduced pine growth as well as all the reproductive parameters measured (female and male cone production, mature cone size, seed production and seed weight), in addition to some deaths. If winter temperatures continue to increase; the pine processionary caterpillar will have a dangerous impact in these relict pine populations, by further reducing the pine's weak regeneration capacity.

By organizing a conference devoted to this theme, we sought to honor the contributions of pioneering, field-based geomorphologists and to encourage our community to contemplate how field work might continue to provide unique insight into a new, more technologically-driven era. For example, given recent advances in remote sensing methods such as LiDAR, what kind of added value can field work provide? Similarly, how can field-based studies contribute to societally relevant, large-scale questions related to climate change and sustainable management of the Earth system? Motivated by such questions, the 2012 BGS was convened in Jackson Hole, WY, a new, Western location that enabled participation by Rocky Mountain and west coast research groups underrepresented at previous Binghamton symposia. Also, in keeping with the field tradition theme, the 2012 BGS emphasized field trips, including a rafting excursion down the Snake River and an overview of the tectonic and glacial history of Jackson Hole. The on-site portion of the symposium consisted of invited oral and poster presentations and contributed posters, including many by graduate students. Topics ranged from an historical overview of the development of geomorphic thinking to long-term sediment tracer studies to a commentary on the synergy between LiDAR and field mapping. This special issue of Geomorphology consists of papers by invited authors from the 2012 BGS, and this overview provides some context for these contributions. Looking forward, we hope that the 43rd annual BGS will stimulate further discussion of the role of field work as the discipline of geomorphology continues to evolve, carrying on the field tradition into the future.

The effect of this variation on geographic patterns in voltinism (generation time) and thermal requirements to produce specific voltinism pathways have not been investigated. The influence of voltinism on fitness traits, body size, and sex ratio is also unclear. We monitored mountain pine beetle voltinism, adult body size, sex ratio, and air temperatures at sites across latitudinal and elevational gradients in the western United States. With the exception of two sites at the coolest and warmest locations, the number of days required to complete a generation was similar. Thermal units required to achieve a generation, however, were significantly less for individuals at the coolest sites. Evolved adaptations explain this pattern, including developmental rates and thresholds that serve to synchronize cohorts and minimize cold-sensitive life stages in winter. These same adaptations reduce the capacity of mountain pine beetle at the warmest sites to take full advantage of increased thermal units, limiting the capacity for bivoltinism within the current realized distribution.

In this study, quantitative evidence based on empirical data is provided to support the key role of extrinsic, climate-induced thresholds in governing the spatial and temporal patterns of tree establishment in these high-elevation environments. Dendroecological techniques were used to reconstruct a 420-year history of regeneration dynamics within upper treeline ecotones along a latitudinal gradient (similar to 44-35 degrees N) in the Rocky Mountains. Correlation analysis was used to assess the possible influence of minimum and maximum temperature indices and cool-season (November-April) precipitation on regional age-structure data. Regime-shift analysis was used to detect thresholds in tree establishment during the entire period of record (1580-2000), temperature variables significantly correlated with establishment during the 20th century, and cool-season precipitation. Tree establishment was significantly correlated with minimum temperature during the spring (March-May) and cool season. Regime-shift analysis identified an abrupt increase in regional tree establishment in 1950 (1950-1954 age class). Coincident with this period was a shift toward reduced cool-season precipitation. The alignment of these climate conditions apparently triggered an abrupt increase in establishment that was unprecedented during the period of record. Two main findings emerge from this research that underscore the critical role of climate in governing regeneration dynamics within upper treeline ecotones. (1) Regional climate variability is capable of exceeding bioclimatic thresholds, thereby initiating synchronous and abrupt changes in the spatial and temporal patterns of tree establishment at broad regional scales. (2) The importance of climate parameters exceeding critical threshold values and triggering a regime shift in tree establishment appears to be contingent on the alignment of favorable temperature and moisture regimes. This research suggests that threshold changes in the climate system can fundamentally alter regeneration dynamics within upper treeline ecotones and, through the use of regime-shift analysis, reveals important climate-vegetation linkages.",2012,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WOS:000306829300013,Becky,Yes,Yes,Yes,,"Upper Rocky Mtns (CO, WY, NM, MT)",Meghan,,,No,,close,NA,,,,,Danny,No,Maybe,No,Front Range,

Although hydrological and process-based water temperature modelling approaches have been successfully applied to small catchments and short time periods, much less work has been done at large spatial and temporal scales. We present a physically based modelling framework for daily river discharge and water temperature simulations applicable to large river systems on a global scale. Model performance was tested globally at 1/2 x 1/2A degrees spatial resolution and a daily time step for the period 1971-2000. We made specific evaluations on large river basins situated in different hydro-climatic zones and characterized by different anthropogenic impacts. Effects of anthropogenic heat discharges on simulated water temperatures were incorporated by using global gridded thermoelectric water use datasets and representing thermal discharges as point sources into the heat advection equation. This resulted in a significant increase in the quality of the water temperature simulations for thermally polluted basins (Rhine, Meuse, Danube and Mississippi). Due to large reservoirs in the Columbia which affect streamflow and thermal regimes, a reservoir routing model was used. This resulted in a significant improvement in the performance of the river discharge and water temperature modelling. Overall, realistic estimates were obtained at daily time step for both river discharge (median normalized BIAS = 0.3; normalized RMSE = 1.2; r = 0.76) and water temperature (median BIAS = -0.3 A degrees C; RMSE = 2.8 A degrees C; r = 0.91) for the entire validation period, with similar performance during warm, dry periods. Simulated water temperatures are sensitive to headwater temperature, depending on resolution and flow velocity. A high sensitivity of water temperature to river discharge (thermal capacity) was found during warm, dry conditions. The modelling approach has potential to be used for risk analyses and studying impacts of climate change and other anthropogenic effects (e.g. thermal pollution, dams and reservoir regulation) on large rivers.",2012,10.5194/hess-16-4303-2012,Geology; Water Resources,WOS:000311514600026,Danny,Maybe,Yes,Yes,Global/International,Perhaps not headwater but columbia,NA,,,,,,Meghan,,,No,global,Danny,Maybe,Yes,Maybe,Large River Basins- Can't discern headwaters,Yes

Geomorphic, volumetric, stratigraphic, and sedimentologic data aided reservoir characterizations. Inferred transit-time distributions for tributary deposits are right-skewed and heavy-tailed, indicating preferential evacuation of younger deposits. The debris-flow fan is much larger than fluvial terraces on the other tributary, but mean transit times (+/-sigma) in both reservoirs are similar: 1370 +/- 2240 yr and 1660 +/- 2130 yr for fan and terrace deposits, respectively. Whereas tributary deposits are much larger than mainstem deposits at both sites, mainstem deposits adjacent to the fan have a relatively short mean transit time of 442 +/- 491 yr, but mean transit time in mainstem deposits adjacent to the fluvial terrace is much greater: 3870 +/- 6720 yr. Reservoir flux estimates indicate that most (>60%) of the debris-flow fan tributary's sediment yield enters fan storage, but only a small part (3%) of the fluvial tributary's yield enters storage at the confluence.

A growing body of evidence, however, suggests substantial mediation of simple range shifts due to climate change by other limiting factors. Understanding limiting factors for a species within different contexts, therefore, is critical for predicting responses to climate change. The American pika (Ochotona princeps) is an ideal species for investigating distributions in relation to climate because of their unusual and well-understood natural history as well as observed shifts to higher elevation in parts of their range. We tested three hypotheses for the climatic or habitat characteristics that may limit pika presence and abundance: summer heat, winter snowpack, and forage availability. We performed these tests using an index of pika abundance gathered in a region where environmental influences on pika distribution have not been well-characterized. We estimated relative pika abundance via scat surveys and quantified climatic and habitat characteristics across two North-Central Rocky Mountain Ranges, the Wind River and Bighorn ranges in Wyoming, USA. Pika scat density was highest at mid-elevations and increased linearly with forage availability in both ranges. Scat density also increased with temperatures conducive to forage plant growth, and showed a unimodal relationship with the number of days below -5 degrees C, which is modulated by insulating snowpack. Our results provide support for both the forage availability and winter snowpack hypotheses.

In the Pacific Northwest vegetation fires regularly produce PyC, but its accumulation in soils is poorly quantified. Using mid-infrared spectroscopy (MIR) and partial least-squares (PLS) analysis in conjunction with ultraviolet photo-oxidation followed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (UV-NMR) techniques, PyC contents were quantified for samples from soil profiles along a vegetation gradient. Sample locations included different forest types as well as sites under agricultural use. While PyC was most prevalent in the first 0.2 m with 7-24% of total soil organic C (SOC), it could be found in the subsoil of all locations. However, PyC concentrations did not change consistently with soil depth. Stock sizes were lowest at the Turkey Farm (0.71 kg m(-2); 10% of SOC) and Organic Growers Farm (1.14 kg m(-2); 8% of SOC) sites, presumably due to the pervasive combustion of grass and cereals. Among the forested sites, lower stocks were observed at sites with higher mean annual temperature (MAT) and lower mean annual precipitation (MAP) such as Metolius (1.71 kg m(-2); 15% of SOC) and Juniper (1.89 kg m(-2); 26% of SOC). In contrast, the highest PyC stocks were found under cooler and moister conditions at Cascade Head dominated by Douglas Fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.)) (5.66 kg m(-2); 16% of SOC) and Soapgrass Mountain (4.80 kg m(-2); 15% of SOC). PyC was only moderately related to non-PyC SOC, which comprises plant residues, their decomposition products and soil biota (r(2) = 0.61 and 0.44 for SOC with and without PyC, respectively), suggesting largely independent processes influencing production and disappearance.

A group selection silvicultural system may protect caribou habitat and allow some timber extraction, if combined with timely regeneration and an extended rotation length. Sporadic seed production can limit natural regeneration and planting may be required to ensure successful regeneration after harvest. However, the opening sizes and planting microsites required for adequate tree growth and survival in these high-elevation sites are unknown. We examined, for 15 years following planting, how growth and survival of planted subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa (Hook.) Nutt.), Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii Parry ex. Engelm.), and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. Ex Loud.) varied with harvest opening size (0.03, 0.13,1.0 ha), planting microsite (raised, protected, rotten wood, scarified, and a control) and elevation. Survival and growth was less in the higher elevation sites and generally increased with opening size, with the increase greater in the lower elevation sites. Survival varied from 12% for lodgepole pine in small openings at higher elevation to 82% for fir in large openings at lower elevation. Overall, fir had the greatest survival. Fir growth increased the most with opening size at higher elevation; pine growth increased the most with opening size at lower elevation. Survival was generally greater on raised, protected, or rotten wood microsites. Growth varied less across microsites than did survival and also varied less across microsites than across opening sizes or elevations. Increased seedling growth and survival for all species was associated with treatments that had earlier snowmelt and higher soil temperatures. Two cycle bud worm (Chroistoneura biennis Freeman) decreased seedling growth in years of heavy infestation. In higher elevation sites, pine had the greatest average height, but relatively low survival and vigor. The poor survival of pine, its lower long-term projected growth rates, and a crown structure which does not facilitate lichen accumulation and its accessibility to caribou, make pine unsuitable for regenerating these forests managed for mountain caribou. Using the group selection silvicultural system on appropriate sites with openings greater than 0.13 ha and with optimal planting microsites should allow for some extraction of timber while maintaining the old-growth attributes needed for caribou habitat in these subalpine forests.

Regardless of fire history, forest canopies were mixed in composition and subcanopies were strongly dominated by shade-tolerant hybrid spruce. Despite their size, subcanopy trees were similar in age to the canopy trees. Current stand composition and age structures largely reflect the effects of high-severity fires that burned similar to 110 years ago at 18 of 29 sites.

Mapping the spatial and temporal patterns of insect disturbance dynamics can help in understanding their impacts on forest ecosystem resilience and functioning, and in developing adaptive management strategies. In recent years, much progress has been made in landscape-level analyses of insect-induced disturbances using remotely sensed data. However, many studies have focused on single insect agents or aggregated different insect agents into a single group. In this study, we characterized the temporal-spectral patterns associated with bark beetle and defoliator disturbances using Landsat time series between 1990 and 2013, with the objective to test if the two insect disturbances can be separated with Landsat data. We analyzed a recent outbreak of mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) and western spruce budworm (Choristoneura freemani Razowski) in British Columbia, Canada. To characterize the disturbance and recovery trends associated with insect disturbances we used the LandTrendr segmentation algorithm. We fitted LandTrendr spectral trajectories to annual normalized burn ratio (NBR) and Tasseled Cap (TC) time series, from which we then extracted a set of disturbance metrics. With these disturbance metrics, two random forest models were trained to a) distinguish insect disturbances from harvest and fire disturbances; and to b) attribute the insect disturbances to the most likely agent, i.e. mountain pine beetle or western spruce budworm. Insect disturbances were successfully mapped with an overall accuracy of 76.8%, and agents were successfully attributed with overall accuracies ranging from 75.3% to 88.0%, depending on whether only pure host-stands or mixed stands with both insect hosts were considered. In the case of mixed host stands, nearly 45% of the western spruce budworm disturbances were falsely attributed to mountain pine beetle. Spectral metrics describing disturbance magnitude were more important for distinguishing the two insect agents than the disturbance duration. Spectral changes associated with western spruce budworm disturbances had generally lower magnitudes than mountain pine beetle disturbances. Moreover, disturbances by western spruce budworm were more strongly associated with changes in TC greenness, whereas disturbances by mountain pine beetle were more strongly associated with changes in TC brightness and wetness. The results reflect the ephemeral nature of defoliators versus the tree mortality impacts of bark beetles in our study area. This study demonstrates the potential of Landsat time series for mapping bark beetle and defoliator disturbances at the agent level and highlights the need for distinguishing between the two insect agents to adequately capture their impacts on ecosystem processes.

We used regime-shift analysis to quantify episodic changes in the rate of tree regeneration at each site (p < 0.05). We employed a climatic water deficit approach to define fine-scale moisture conditions to compare with dendroecological data from opposite aspects on eleven mountain peaks along a latitudinal gradient in the U.S. Rocky Mountains. Regime-shift analysis measured abrupt, yet asynchronous increases in tree establishment across contrasting slope aspects on 10 of 11 mountain peaks. Upper treeline advance was significantly greater (p < 0.05) during drought on north-facing slopes. On south-facing slopes, ecotonal dynamics varied more with respect to fluxes in the climatic water deficit; namely because of differences in local hydroclimate regimes.

In addition to the processes and phenomena commonly represented in individual-based models of forest stand dynamics, we added some species-specific phenology and sire-specific frost events. The consideration of bud-break heat sum requirements, growing season limits, and chilling requirements for the induction of dormancy and cold hardiness slightly improved the ability of Zelig to predict the present composition of B.C. forests. Simulations of the predicted effects of future climatic regimes (based on the averaged predictions of four general circulation models) include some major shifts in equilibrial, forest composition and productivity. Lowland temperate coastal forests are predicted to be severely stressed because indigenous species will no longer have their winter chilling requirements met. High-elevation coastal forests are expected to increase in productivity, while interior subalpine forests are expected to remain stable in productivity but will gradually be replaced by species currently characteristic of lower elevations. Dry, interior low-elevation forests in southern B.C. are likely to persist relatively unchanged, while wet interior forests are expected to support dramatic increases in yield, primarily by western hemlock. Northern interior sub-boreal forests are likewise expected to increase in productivity through enhanced growth of lodgepole pine. Conversely, the precipitous collapse of spruce stands in the true boreal forests of northeastern B.C. is expected to be associated with reduced productivity as they are replaced by pine species. Boreal-Cordilleran and Moist Boreal Mixedwood forests in Alberta are less likely to undergo compositional change, while becoming somewhat more productive. We believe these model enhancements to be a significant improvement over existing formulations, but the resulting predictions must still be viewed with caution.

Such projections may enable managers to preempt or reduce emerging climate-related threats through appropriate habitat management. We used NatureServe's Climate Change Vulnerability Index (CCVI) to predict vulnerability to climate change of 168 bird species that breed in the Sierra Nevada mountains of California, USA. The CCVI assesses species-specific exposure and sensitivity to climate change within a defined geographic area, through the integration of (a) species' range maps, (b) information about species' natural history traits and ecological relationships, (c) historic and current climate data, and (d) spatially explicit climate change projections. We conducted the assessment under two different downscaled climate models with divergent projections about future precipitation through the middle of the 21st century. Assessments differed relatively little under the two climate models. Of five CCVI vulnerability ranking categories, only one species, White-tailed Ptarmigan (Lagopus leucura), received the most vulnerable rank, Extremely Vulnerable. No species received the second-highest vulnerability ranking, Highly Vulnerable. Sixteen species scored as Moderately Vulnerable using one or both climate models: Common Merganser (Mergus merganser), Osprey (Pandion haliaetus), Bald Eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus), Northern Goshawk (Accipiter gentilis), Peregrine Falcon (Falco peregrinus), Prairie Falcon (Falco mexicanus), Spotted Sandpiper (Actitis macularius), Great Gray Owl (Strix nebulosa), Black Swift (Cypseloides niger), Clark's Nutcracker (Nucifraga columbiana), American Dipper (Cinclus mexicanus), Swainson's Thrush (Catharus ustulatus), American Pipit (Anthus rubescens), Gray-crowned Rosy-Finch (Leucosticte tephrocotis), Pine Grosbeak (Pinicola enucleator), and Evening Grosbeak (Coccothraustes vespertinus). Species associated with alpine/subalpine habitats and aquatic habitats received significantly more vulnerable rankings than birds associated with other habitats.

We analysed vegetation and environmental data using clustering, ordination, classification, and ANOVA techniques to reveal environmental gradients affecting a broad vegetation pattern and discriminate these gradients. The specific objective was to assess and classify the response of the complex vegetation to those environmental factors operating at a coarse-scale climatic level. Ordination revealed the dominant role of regional, altitude-based climate in the area. Based on vegetation physiognomy, represented by five tree species, climatic data and taxonomic classification of zonal soils, we identified two vegetation geo-climatic zones: (1) a montane zone, with Rocky Mountain juniper and Douglas-fir; and (2) a subalpine zone, with Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir as climatic climax species. Aspen was excluded from the zonation due to its great ecological amplitude. We found significant differences between the zones in regional climate and landform geomorphology/soils. Regional climate was represented by elevation, precipitation, and air and soil temperatures; and geomorphology by soil types. This coarse-scale vegetation geo-climatic zonation provides a framework for a comprehensive ecosystem survey, which is missing in the central Rocky Mountains of the United States.

In many of these ecosystems, the spring snowpack is melting earlier due to climatic warming and atmospheric dust deposition, which could greatly modify soil water resources during the growing season. Though snowmelt timing is known to influence soil water availability during summer, there is little known about the depth of the effects and how long the effects persist. We therefore manipulated the timing of seasonal snowmelt in a high-elevation mixed-conifer forest in a Mediterranean climate during consecutive wet and dry years. The snow-all-gone (SAG) date was advanced by 6 days in the wet year and 3 days in the dry year using black sand to reduce the snow surface albedo. To maximize variation in snowmelt timing, we also postponed the SAG date by 8 days in the wet year and 16 days in the dry year using white fabric to shade the snowpack from solar radiation. We found that deeper soil water (30-60 cm) did not show a statistically significant response to snowmelt timing. Shallow soil water (0-30 cm), however, responded strongly to snowmelt timing. The drying effect of accelerated snowmelt lasted 2 months in the 0-15 cm depth and at least 4 months in the 15-30 cm depth. Therefore, the legacy of snowmelt timing on soil moisture can persist through dry periods, and continued earlier snowmelt due to climatic warming and windblown dust could reduce near-surface water storage and availability to plants and soil biota.

Given the recent mortality and changes in regional climate over the past several decades, there is a keen interest in post-mortality regeneration dynamics in pinon-juniper woodlands. Here, we examined pinon and Utah juniper (Juniperus osteosperma) recruitment at 30 sites across southwestern Colorado, USA that spanned a gradient of adult pinon mortality levels (10-100%) to understand current regeneration dynamics. Pinon and juniper recruitment was greater at sites with more tree and shrub cover. Pinon recruitment was more strongly facilitated than juniper recruitment by trees and shrubs. New (post-mortality) pinon recruitment was negatively affected by recent mortality. However, mortality had no effect on pinon advanced regeneration (juveniles established pre-mortality) and did not shift juvenile pinon dominance. Our results highlight the importance of shrubs and juniper trees for the facilitation of pinon establishment and survival. Regardless of adult pinon mortality levels, areas with low tree and shrub cover may become increasingly juniper dominated as a result of the few suitable microsites for pinon establishment and survival.

Lichenometry initially appeared promising as ages showed an increase from cirque headwalls to down-canyon moraines. However, while Recess Peak lichen age estimates range from 2 to 3 ka, recent work shows these deposits to be at least 10 ka older. Here, we present evidence for a late Holocene reset of Recess Peak lichen ages by significant post-depositional climate change. Following late-Pleistocene deposition of Recess Peak moraines, warming through the mid-Holocene allowed forests to advance into shallow basins eliminating local inverted tree lines. This produced a partial canopy where shading killed the original post-Pleistocene crustose lichen colonies. Late-Holocene cooling resulted in forest retreat from these basins as alpine tree line fell. Lichens then recolonized the re-exposed Recess Peak deposits. We conclude that while Recess Peak lichen ages are accurate to within the dating uncertainty of the technique, existing lichen ages actually date the timing of post-mid-Holocene cooling and recolonization, and not the original emplacement of these deposits. Thus, applications of Lichenometry should consider post-depositional environmental change when interpreting the meaning of these dates. (c) 2013 University of Washington. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Under these conditions, forest managers should choose the best silvicultural practices to optimize production of timber and ecosystem services, while reducing pest damage to tolerable levels. However, information on the short and long term impacts of key pests, such as mountain pine beetle (MPB) (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins), especially when they occur outside their historical geographical range, is scarce and our ability to predict, pre-empt and react to problems is, therefore, limited. Here we propose a general framework to evaluate the risk and impacts of important forest insects in new habitats, and to identify information gaps when conducting risk assessments. The framework consists of four main steps. The first step of risk assessment under potential range expansion is to identify the factors that promote pest spread and colonization of new environments (hazard). A second step is to determine the area at risk and the potential economic impacts (exposure). The third step is to establish if the forest in the new habitat is susceptible to colonization and pest range expansion (vulnerability). The fourth and final step is to determine the options for risk communication and mitigation. We also illustrate the scope and application of this response framework to decision makers, using, as an example, the potential spread of MPB from its native habitats in BC and Alberta into the boreal forests of Canada, especially with regard to the forests of Quebec.

Experience shows us that weather is already a driving influence in forest management as extreme-weather events cause substantial damage. Biotic and abiotic disturbances create significant uncertainty for managers, and present a significant risk of loss to the growing stock. Forecasts of climate change indicate increasing average temperatures and changes in precipitation patterns. These forecasts also suggest more extreme-weather events. Changing weather patterns mean changing interactions between forests and disturbance agents, likely resulting in unprecedented levels of damage. Research forest managers have developed an approach to managing this uncertainty and risk through forest management planning. If climate change will lead to more extreme weather, it is expected that adapting to climate change will equate to managing risk. A retrospective examination of the response to the mountain pine beetle outbreak (1991-2005) has enabled us to document our approach to managing the risk of damage and loss. Forest management planning provides a framework to establish priorities, set objectives and devise strategies to maintain the values that are important on research forests as they adapt to climate change.

These units are unusual compared to typical syntectonic conglomerates in that they occur as a thin interval underlain by a disconformity, are far-traveled across most of the length of their basins, generally reflect a change in dispersal direction relative to underlying deposits and were deposited during a period of reduced subsidence. All units were deposited well after local initiation of the Laramide orogeny but within similar to 8 m.y. of each other. However, each conglomerate unit was separately derived from individual source areas and is not part of a once-continuous gravel sheet. Similar widespread conglomerate units of this age are apparently absent in other Rocky Mountain Laramide basins. Previous studies postulate the shallow subduction of an oceanic plateau-the conjugate Shatsky Rise-beneath the U.S. Cordillera during the time interval of conglomerate deposition. The distribution, timing, and dispersion directions of the far-traveled conglomerates are grossly consistent with vertical motions and surface tilting along the transport path of the oceanic plateau. An exact match of conglomerate timing differs from previously proposed models, but uncertainties in timing of deposits, and the lack of constraints on the shape and structure of the subducted plateau preclude our ability to further refine the comparison. Elsewise local tectonic activity, climate change, and sea-level fluctuations fail to explain the observed spatiotemporal pattern.

Recent phylogenetic analyses have shown that the sister group of this clade is Potentilla section Rivales, a group with distinct moist habitat preferences. This has led to the hypothesis that the ivesioids (genera Ivesia, Horkelia and Horkeliella) diversified in response to the late Tertiary aridification of western North America. We used phyloclimatic modeling and a fossil-calibrated dated phylogeny of the family Rosaceae to investigate the evolution of the ivesioid clade. We have combined occurrence-and climate data from extant species, and used ancestral state reconstruction to model past climate preferences. These models have been projected into paleo-climatic scenarios in order to identify areas where the ivesioids may have occurred. Our analysis suggests a split between the ivesioids and Potentilla sect.

Using superimposed epoch analysis we examined average-vegetation and individual-taxon responses to eight randomly selected fire events over the past 4.0 ka. Pollen evidence shows that on average fires produce a weak response of declining Pinus while other taxa including Artemisia and Poaceae increase directly after fire episodes. Within 30 yr of a disturbance, pollen data indicate ecosystem recovery to pre-fire composition, consistent with modern studies of fire recovery of limber pine forests. Similar to short-term changes of pollen abundance, long-term vegetation responses indicate Pinus abundance weakly declining and Artemisia increasing when fire episodes are frequent.

This new multi-proxy record is characterized by alternating organic-rich/carbonate-rich sediment units, interpreted to reflect hydrologically-forced changes in the lake's depositional environment. Our interpretation of the proxy data indicates nine decadal-to-multi-centennial pluvial episodes (PE) over the past 9170 cal yr BP. Of these nine inferred pluvials, five are interpreted as more pronounced based on their combined proxy interpretations: (PE-V) 9170?-8250, (PE-IV) 7000-6400, (PE-III) 3350-3000, (PE-II) 850-700, and (PE-I) 500-476 (top of core) cal yr BP. The Lower Bear Lake record indicates that the San Bernardino Mountains, source region for the Mojave River and its terminal playa, was wet during the same periods (within dating errors), to several of the major pluvials proposed from the lakes in the sink of the Mojave River. Our comparison extends north also to Tulare Lake, which drains the southcentral-western Sierra Nevada Mountains. This temporally and spatially coherent signal indicates that a similar climate forcing acted to increase regional wetness at various times during the past 9170 cal yr BP. As originally proposed by Enzel. Ely, and colleagues (e.g., Enzel et al., 1989; Enzel, 1992; Ely et al., 1994; Enzel and Wells, 1997), we too contend that Holocene pluvial episodes are associated with changing the frequency of large winter storms that track across a broad region at decadal-to-multi-centennial timescales. We build upon their hypothesis through the addition of new and better-dated site comparisons, recent advances in the understanding of atmospheric rivers, and improved knowledge of the ocean-atmosphere dynamics that caused the early 20th century western United States pluvial.

We analyzed tree overstory-understory relationships on 123 sites in the Spring Mountains within the Mojave Desert near Las Vegas, Nevada, USA to assess three hypotheses. We hypothesized that: the tree species comprising understories are less tolerant of fire than species in overstories, reflecting land-management practices of fire exclusion; mid-elevation forests have the lowest overstory:understory similarity because this zone could have maximum species mixing; and overstory:understory similarity is correlated with environmental gradients (consisting of 14 topographic and soil variables). We found that Pinus monophylla comprised greater relative canopy cover in understories of juniper (32% relative cover) and pinyon-juniper (78%) forests than it did in overstories of these forests (0% and 53%). Similarly, fire-intolerant Abies concolor had 6-fold greater understory than overstory cover in forests with overstories dominated by the fire-tolerant Pinus ponderosa. Overstory:understory Sorensen similarity averaged 43%-77% among six forest types, and there was little support for the supposition that similarity was lowest in mid-elevation forests. Distributions of individual overstory and understory species more closely corresponded with environmental gradients than did overstory:understory similarity. Results suggest that there is high potential for change in at least two of the six dominant forest types of the Spring Mountains. The direction of change (species of moist, higher elevation sites establishing in understories of drier forests) is the opposite of what would be expected for forest adaptation to the warmer, drier, more fire-prone conditions projected for the next century in the southwestern USA.",2012,10.1007/s12224-011-9108-7,Plant Sciences,WOS:000304702500001,Becky,No,Yes,No,,"Mojave Desert near Las Vegas, Nevada, USA",NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Danny,No,,No,"Mojave Desert near Las Vegas, Nevada, USA",

The late-glacial interval (> 11,600 cal year BP) featured sparse vegetation cover and the erosion of minerogenic sediment into the lake from nearby hillslopes, as evidenced by Cyperaceae-dominated pollen assemblages and high magnetic susceptibility (MS) values. Betula expanded in the early Holocene (11,600-8,500 cal year BP), reducing mass wasting on the landscape, as reflected by lower MS. Holocene sediments contain a series of silt- and clay-dominated layers, and given their physical characteristics and the topographic setting of the lake on the braided outwash plain of the Okpilak River, the inorganic layers are interpreted as rapidly deposited fluvial sediments, likely associated with intervals of river aggradation, changes in channel planform, and periodic overbank flow via a channel that connects the river and lake. The episodes of fluvial dynamics and aggradation appear to have been related to regional environmental variability, including a period of glacial retreat during the early Holocene, as well as glacial advances in the middle Holocene (5,500-5,200 cal year BP) and during the Little Ice Age (500-400 cal year BP). The rapid deposition of multiple inorganic layers during the early Holocene, including thick layers at 10,900-10,000 and 9,400-9,200 cal year BP, suggests that it was a particularly dynamic interval of fluvial activity and landscape change.",2012,10.1007/s10933-012-9605-6,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,WOS:000304566900008,Becky,No,Maybe,No,,"Brooks Range, AK",NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Danny,No,,No,"Brooks Range, AK",

The Fraser River is the largest Canadian waterway flowing to the Pacific Ocean and is one of the world's greatest salmon rivers. Our analyses reveal high runoff rates and low interannual variability in alpine and coastal rivers, and low runoff rates and high interannual variability in most streams in BC's interior. The interannual variability in streamflow is also low in rivers such as the Adams, Chilko, Quesnel and Stuart where the principal salmon runs of the Fraser River occur. A trend analysis shows a spatially coherent signal with increasing interannual variability in streamflow across the FRB in recent decades, most notably in spring and summer. The upward trend in the coefficient of variation in annual runoff coincides with a period of near-normal annual runoff for the Fraser River at Hope. The interannual variability in streamflow is greater in regulated rather than natural systems; however, it is unclear whether it is predominantly flow regulation that leads to these observed differences. Environmental changes such as rising air temperatures, more frequent polarity changes in large-scale climate teleconnections such as El Nino-Southern Oscillation and Pacific Decadal Oscillation, and retreating glaciers may be contributing to the greater range in annual runoff fluctuations across the FRB. This has implications for ecological processes throughout the basin, for example affecting migrating and spawning salmon, a keystone species vital to First Nations communities as well as to commercial and recreational fisheries. To exemplify this linkage between variable flows and biological responses, the unusual FRB runoff anomalies observed in 2010 are discussed in the context of that year's sockeye salmon run. As the climate continues to warm, greater variability in annual streamflow, and hence in hydrological extremes, may influence ecological processes and human usage throughout the FRB in the 21st century.",2012,10.1088/1748-9326/7/2/024019,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,WOS:000307590300022,Becky,No,Yes,No,,Changes in flow in Fraser River ,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Danny,No,,No,Changes in flow in Fraser River ,

The ecohydrological consequences of forest die-off have been little studied and remain highly uncertain. To explore this knowledge gap, we apply the extensive literature on the ecohydrological effects of tree harvest in combination with the limited existing die-off ecohydrology research to develop new, relevant hypotheses. Tree mortality results in loss of canopy cover, which directly alters evaporation, transpiration, and canopy interception and indirectly alters other watershed hydrologic processes, including infiltration, runoff, groundwater recharge, and streamflow. Both die-off and harvest research suggest that for most forests, water yield can be expected to increase following substantial loss of tree cover by die-off. We hypothesize that where annual precipitation exceeds 500 mm or water yield is dominated by snowmelt, watersheds will experience significantly decreased evapotranspiration and increased flows if absolute canopy cover loss from die-off exceeds 20%. However, recent observations suggest that water yield following die-off can potentially decrease rather than increase in drier forests. To reliably predict die-off responses, more research is needed to test these hypotheses, including observations of multiple water budget components and the persistence of ecohydrological effects with the post-die-off successional dynamics of tree recruitment, understorey growth, and interactions with additional disturbances. With die-off, mitigation and restoration options are limited and costly, necessitating societal adaptation; therefore, die-off ecohydrology should be a high priority for future research.

This study examines whether mountain snowpack and snowmelt have manifested a consistent hydrologic response to global climatic changes over the past several decades. Prior findings are compared to identify spatial and temporal patterns of trends in the volume, extent, and seasonality of snowpack and melt for key mountain regions. Evidence suggests that both temperature and precipitation increases to date have impacted mountain snowpacks simultaneously on the global scale; however, the nature of the impact is, among other factors', strongly dependent on geographic location, latitude, and elevation. Warmer temperatures at mid-elevations have decreased snowpack and resulted in earlier melt in spite of precipitation increases. while they have not affected high-elevation regions that remain well below freezing during winter. At high elevations, precipitation increases have resulted in increased snowpack. Not all local responses are consistent with the general findings, possibly because of local climatic trends, atmospheric circulation patterns, record lengths, or data quality issues. With continued warming, increasingly higher elevations are projected to experience declines in snowpack accumulation and melt that can no longer be offset by winter precipitation increases. There is a continued research need for hydroclimatic trend detection and attribution in mountains owing to the length, quality, and sparseness of available data from monitoring stations not directly impacted by human activity.

The Angora Fire burned at unusually high severity due to heavy fuels; strong winds; warm, dry weather; and unseasonably low fuel moistures. The fire destroyed 254 homes, and final loss and suppression cost estimates of $160,000,000 make the Angora Fire one of the ten costliest wildfires in US history. The Angora Fire burned into 194 ha of fuel treatments intended to modify fire behavior and protect private and public assets in the Angora Creek watershed. The fire thus provides a unique opportunity to quantitatively assess the effects of fuel treatments on wildfire severity in an area of wildland-urban interface. We measured fire effects on vegetation in treated and adjacent untreated areas within the Angora Fire perimeter, immediately after and one year after the fire. Our measures of fire severity included tree mortality; height of bole char, crown scorch, and crown torch; and percent crown scorch and torch. Unlike most studies of fuel treatment effectiveness, our study design included replication and implicitly controlled for variation in topography and weather. Our results show that fuel treatments generally performed as designed and substantially changed fire behavior and subsequent fire effects to forest vegetation. Exceptions include two treatment units where slope steepness led to lower levels of fuels removal due to local standards for erosion prevention. Hand-piled fuels in one of these two units had also not yet been burned. Excepting these units, bole char height and fire effects to the forest canopy (measured by crown scorching and torching) were significantly lower, and tree survival significantly higher, within sampled treatments than outside them. In most cases, crown fire behavior changed to surface fire within 50 m of encountering a fuel treatment. The Angora Fire underlines the important role that properly implemented fuel treatments can play in protecting assets, reducing fire severity and increasing forest resilience.

Using core samples taken from Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), pinon pine (Pinus edulis), and limber pine (Pinus flexilis) at 38 sites, we were able to reconstruct streamflows for the headwaters of the Wind River back to 1672 AD or earlier.

We measured daytime soil respiration (R (s)) over five summers (June-September) in a Sierra Nevada mixed-conifer forest on undisturbed plots and plots manipulated with thinning, burning and their combination. We compared mean summer R (s) by year with seasonal precipitation. On undisturbed plots we found that winter precipitation (PPT(w)) explained between 77-96% of interannual variability in summer R (s). In contrast, spring and summer precipitation had no significant effect on summer R (s). PPT(w) is an important influence on summer R (s) in the Sierra Nevada because over 80% of annual precipitation falls as snow between October and April, thus greatly influencing the soil water conditions during the following growing season. Thinning and burning disrupted the relationship between PPT(w) and R(s), possibly because of significant increases in soil moisture and temperature as tree density and canopy cover decreased.

Mesofilter conservation methods may facilitate the simultaneous management of multiple species. We used data on distributions of two sets of avian guilds, based on dependence on riparian vegetation and on nest location, to relate occurrence rates to environmental variables. Variables were selected by expert opinion and are likely to be affected by changes in climate and land use. Location Data were collected from 2001-06 in four adjacent mountain ranges in the central Great Basin (Lander, Nye and Eureka counties, Nevada, USA): the Shoshone Mountains and the Toiyabe, Toquima and Monitor ranges. Methods Data on occurrence of birds, vegetation composition and vegetation structure were obtained in the field. Geographical coordinates and the normalized difference vegetation index were derived from a digital elevation model and a satellite image. To construct a general model for guilds as a whole, while allowing flexibility for variation in the functional responses of individual species, we applied multivariate adaptive regression splines. Results The predictive capacity of expert knowledge of relationships between birds and vegetation was inconsistent. Latitude, longitude and elevation may constrain the response of some guilds to changes in vegetation structure and composition. Guild-based models were useful for modelling species with sparse distributions, which are difficult to model individually. In essence, this method supplements models for the individual species with patterns for the guild to which they belong. Main conclusions Guilds of birds appeared to have predictable associations with selected attributes of vegetation structure and composition. The criteria by which species are grouped into guilds may affect the success of predictions and management interventions.

Intense human pressure, both direct and indirect, is having profound effects on natural environments. The amphibians-frogs, salamanders, and caecilians-may be the only major group currently at risk globally. A detailed worldwide assessment and subsequent updates show that one-third or more of the 6,300 species are threatened with extinction. This trend is likely to accelerate because most amphibians occur in the tropics and have small geographic ranges that make them susceptible to extinction. The increasing pressure from habitat destruction and climate change is likely to have major impacts on narrowly adapted and distributed species. We show that salamanders on tropical mountains are particularly at risk. A new and significant threat to amphibians is a virulent, emerging infectious disease, chytridiomycosis, which appears to be globally distributed, and its effects may be exacerbated by global warming. This disease, which is caused by a fungal pathogen and implicated in serious declines and extinctions of > 200 species of amphibians, poses the greatest threat to biodiversity of any known disease.

Understory response to treatments significantly differed between sites with herb biomass increasing in shrub-dominated communities when snowpack was reduced. Fire was a more important factor in post-treatment species richness and cover than either snowpack addition or reduction. Nitrogen additions unexpectedly increased herbaceous species richness.

The results, validated against field measurements, showed that modeled NPP was sensitive to most inputs measured in the study area, with LAI and forest type the most important forest input, and solar radiation the most important climate input. Soil available water holding capacity expressed as a function of wetness index was only significant in conjunction with precipitation when both parameters represented a moisture-deficit situation. NPP uncertainty resulting from topographic influence was equivalent to 140 kg C ha (1) . Year (1). This suggested that topographic correction of model inputs is important for accurate NPP estimation. The BEPS model, designed originally for flat boreal forests, was shown to be applicable in mountainous terrain given appropriate image terrain corrections using the SCS+C approach. Rocky Mountain carbon dynamics were simulated with average annual NPP of Kananaskis forests estimated at 4.01 t C ha(1) . year(1) and compared favourably with the field plot estimate of 4.24 t C ha(1) .

Results were projected on a lodgepole pine-dominated landscape in south-central British Columbia, Canada to examine differences in the density, distribution and type of live tree and deadwood habitats following the MPB outbreak and salvage logging. Tree mortality caused by MPB varied considerably with percent pine and factors that affect tree size, including tree age, size and growing site. Mortality ranged as much as 38-86% even in 100% pine stands, creating a range of residual live tree levels and a pulse of snags that contributes to the increased total and well-decayed CWD volumes over time. In contrast, salvage logging consistently reduces large live trees and snags and contributes to long-term declines in both total and well-decayed snag and CWD volume. Compared to the MPB outbreak, widespread salvage logging will leave a paucity of live trees, snags and CWD in cutover areas on the landscape. This becomes a concern if ongoing natural disturbances and timber harvest deplete remaining mature forests and few intermediate aged forests (40-100 yrs) exist to recruit new live tree and deadwood habitats in the future. Careful planning prior to salvage logging is required to maintain and recruit adequate live tree and deadwood habitats to support native wildlife in future landscapes.

Air temperature lapse rates measured at screen height from valley bottoms up to treeline are normal in the maritime extreme southwest, normal but weak in much of the region, and inverted in the highly continental northernmost sites. Relationships between air and ground surface temperatures, expressed as freezing and thawing n-factors, vary significantly with vegetation type and hence elevational band, with the lowest values for the forested zone and the highest for non-maritime alpine tundra. Equilibrium modelling carried out for one site in the southern part of the region and one in the northern part illustrates the impacts of the differing n-factors on trends in mean ground surface temperature with elevation. Ground thermal regimes determined at borehole locations vary greatly due to these climatic controls but are also affected by substrate. Valley-bottom permafrost in the south is scattered, at temperatures just below 0 degrees C, has a depth of zero annual amplitude of 23 m (due to latent heat effects) and may be only a few metres in thickness. Permafrost on bedrock summits is cold, has active layers >5 m thick, is >50 m thick and may be locally continuous. Given the range of air temperatures and n-factors, permafrost is possible throughout the Yukon but higher temperatures southward and stronger lapse rates mean that a lower elevational limit exists in northern British Columbia.",2012,10.1111/j.1468-0459.2012.00462.x,Physical Geography; Geology,WOS:000304466800003,Danny,No,Yes,No,Landscape/State-Province,Yukon Territory,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Danny,No,,No,Yukon Territory,

Although fire size and frequency are important, they do not necessarily scale with ecosystem effects of fire, as different ecosystems have different ecological and evolutionary relationships with fire. Our study assessed trends and patterns in fire size and frequency from 1910 to 2008 (all fires > 40 ha), and the percentage of high-severity in fires from 1987 to 2008 (all fires > 400 ha) on the four national forests of northwestern California. During 1910-2008, mean and maximum fire size and total annual area burned increased, but we found no temporal trend in the percentage of high-severity fire during 1987-2008. The time series of severity data was strongly influenced by four years with region-wide lightning events that burned huge areas at primarily low moderate severity. Regional fire rotation reached a high of 974 years in 1984 and fell to 95 years by 2008. The percentage of high-severity fire in conifer-dominated forests was generally higher in areas dominated by smaller-diameter trees than in areas with larger-diameter trees. For Douglas-fir forests, the percentage of high-severity fire did not differ significantly between areas that re-burned and areas that only burned once (10% vs. 9%) when re-burned within 30 years. Percentage of high-severity fire decreased to 5% when intervals between first and second fires were >30 years. In contrast, in both mixed-conifer and fir/high-elevation conifer forests, the percentage of high-severity fire was less when re-burned within 30 years compared to first-time burned (12% vs. 16% for mixed conifer; 11% vs. 19% for fir/high-elevation conifer). Additionally, the percentage of high-severity fire did not differ whether the re-burn interval was less than or greater than 30 years. Years with larger fires and greatest area burned were produced by region-wide lightning events, and characterized by less winter and spring precipitation than years dominated by smaller human-ignited fires. Overall percentage of high-severity fire was generally less in years characterized by these region-wide lightning events. Our results suggest that, under certain conditions, wildfires could be more extensively used to achieve ecological and management objectives in northwestern California.",2012,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WOS:000301095600014,Danny,No,Yes,No,Ecosystem/Municipal,"Klamath Mtns, Nor Cal",NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Danny,No,,No,"Klamath Mtns, Nor Cal",

An important consequence of these changes may be an increase in landslides in high mountains. More research, however, is necessary to detect changes in landslide magnitude and frequency related to contemporary climate, particularly in alpine regions hosting glaciers, permafrost, and snow. These regions not only are sensitive to changes in both temperature and precipitation, but are also areas in which landslides are ubiquitous even under a stable climate. We analyze a series of catastrophic slope failures that occurred in the mountains of Europe, the Americas, and the Caucasus since the end of the 1990s. We distinguish between rock and ice avalanches, debris flows from de-glaciated areas, and landslides that involve dynamic interactions with glacial and river processes. Analysis of these events indicates several important controls on slope stability in high mountains, including: the non-linear response of firn and ice to warming; three-dimensional warming of subsurface bedrock and its relation to site geology; de-glaciation accompanied by exposure of new sediment; and combined short-term effects of precipitation and temperature. Based on several case studies, we propose that the following mechanisms can significantly alter landslide magnitude and frequency, and thus hazard, under warming conditions: (1) positive feedbacks acting on mass movement processes that after an initial climatic stimulus may evolve independently of climate change; (2) threshold behavior and tipping points in geomorphic systems; (3) storage of sediment and ice involving important lag-time effects.

For impact studies that involve glacier modelling, the sparsity or complete absence of climate monitoring activities within the regions of interest presents a substantial additional challenge. Downscaling methods for this application must be independent of climate observations and cannot rely on tuning to station data. We present new, computationally-efficient methods for downscaling precipitation and temperature to the high spatial resolutions required to force mountain glacier models. Our precipitation downscaling is based on an existing linear theory for orographic precipitation, which we modify for large study regions by including moist air tracking. Temperature is downscaled using an interpolation scheme that reconstructs the vertical temperature structure to estimate surface temperatures from upper air data. Both methods are able to produce output on km to sub-km spatial resolution, yet do not require tuning to station measurements. By comparing our downscaled precipitation (1 km resolution) and temperature (200 m resolution) fields to station measurements in southern British Columbia, we evaluate their performance regionally and through the annual cycle. Precipitation is improved by as much as 30% (median relative error) over the input reanalysis data and temperature is reconstructed with a mean bias of 0.5A degrees C at locations with high vertical relief. Both methods perform best in mountainous terrain, where glaciers tend to be concentrated.",2012,10.1007/s00382-010-0949-1,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,WOS:000298753200023,Danny,No,Yes,No,Landscape/State-Province,Southen Western BC Glaciers,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Danny,No,,No,Southen Western BC Glaciers,

We used a provenance trial in which replicated genotypes from populations varying in mean annual temperature were transplanted to a common garden adjacent to the Lower Colorado River in southeastern California. The garden environment represented an extreme maximum temperature for the study species. Four major findings emerged: (1) Genotypic variation in ANPP was significant for all species with broad-sense heritability (H(2)) across populations of 0.11, 0.13, and 0.10 for P. fremontii, S. gooddingii, and S. exigua, respectively, and within-population H(2) ranging from 0.00 to 0.25, 0.00 to 0.44, and 0.02 to 0.21, respectively. (2) Population ANPP decreased linearly as mean annual maximum temperature (MAMT) transfer distance increased for both P. fremontii (r(2) = 0.64) and S. gooddingii (r(2) = 0.37), whereas it did not change for S. exigua; (3) Populations with similar MAMT to that of the common garden were 1.5 and 1.2 times more productive than populations with 5.0 degrees C MAMT transfer distances for P. fremontii and S. gooddingii, respectively; and (4) Variation in regression slopes among species for the relationship between ANPP and MAMT indicate species-specific responses to temperature.

When active, these systems provided important food and water sources for local fauna, supported hydrophilic and phreatophytic vegetation, and acted as catchments for eolian and alluvial sediments. Desert wetlands are represented in the geologic record by groundwater discharge deposits, which are also called spring or wetland deposits. Groundwater discharge deposits contain information on the timing and magnitude of past changes in water-table levels and, thus, are a source of paleohydrologic and paleoclimatic information. Here, we present the results of an investigation of extensive groundwater discharge deposits in the central Mojave Desert at Valley Wells, California. We used geologic mapping and stratigraphic relations to identify two distinct wetland sequences at Valley Wells, which we dated using radiocarbon, luminescence, and uranium-series techniques. We also analyzed the sediments and microfauna (ostracodes and gastropods) to reconstruct the specific environments in which they formed. Our results suggest that the earliest episode of high water-table conditions at Valley Wells began ca. 60 ka (thousands of calendar yr B.P.), and culminated in peak discharge between ca. 40 and 35 ka. During this time, cold (4-12 degrees C) emergent groundwater supported extensive wetlands that likely were composed of a wet, sedge-rush-tussock meadow mixed with mesic riparian forest. After ca. 35 ka, the water table dropped below the ground surface but was still shallow enough to support dense stands of phreatophytes through the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). The water table dropped further after the LGM, and xeric conditions prevailed until modest wetlands returned briefly during the Younger Dryas cold event (13.0-11.6 ka). We did not observe any evidence of wet conditions during the Holocene at Valley Wells. The timing of these fluctuations is consistent with changes in other paleowetland systems in the Mojave Desert, the nearby Great Basin Desert, and in southeastern Arizona, near the border of the Sonoran and Chihuahuan Deserts. The similarities in hydrologic conditions between these disparate locations suggest that changes in groundwater levels during the late Pleistocene in desert wetlands scattered throughout the American Southwest were likely driven by synoptic-scale climate processes.",2011,10.1130/B30357.1,Geology,WOS:000295402600006,Danny,No,No,No,Ecosystem/Municipal,Mojave Desert,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Danny,No,,No,Mojave Desert,

Additional mechanisms, such as interactions between atmospheric circulation, ice-sheet dynamics, and the influence of solar irradiance, also have been proposed to explain abrupt climatic events, but evidence remains elusive. This study presents evidence from multi-proxy analyses on the Holocene sediments of Eleanor Lake, interior British Columbia. Climatic inferences from our decadal-resolution record of biogenic silica (BSi) abundance are supported by changes in diatom and pollen assemblages from the same core and correlations with existing regional climate records. The BSi record reveals abrupt and persistent climatic shifts at 10.2, 9.3, and 8.5 ka, the latter two of which are coeval with major collapses of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. The record also reveals a short-term cooling at 8.2 ka that is distinct from the 8.5 ka event and similar in magnitude to several other late-Holocene coolings. BSi is correlated with solar-irradiance indices (r = 0.43-0.61), but the correlation is opposite in sign to that expected from direct solar forcing and weakens after 8 ka. Possible mechanisms causing the abrupt and persistent climate changes of the early Holocene include 1) sudden losses of ice and proglacial lake extent, causing a shift in the meridional structure of atmospheric circulation, 2) a possible link between solar minima and El Nino-like conditions that are correlated with warm spring temperature in interior British Columbia, and 3) the influence of solar irradiance variability on the position of the polar jet, possibly via effects on the strength of the glacial anticyclone.

The dominant sagebrush (sub) species as well as the composition and proportion of shrubs, grasses, and forbs varies across different ecological sites as a function of precipitation, temperature, soils, topographic position, elevation, and disturbance history. Most important to Greater Sage-Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) are three subspecies of big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata)(basin big sagebrush [A. t. ssp. tridentata], Wyoming big sagebrush [A. t. ssp. wyomingensis], and mountain big sagebrush [A. t. ssp. vaseyana]); two low or dwarf forms (little sagebrush [A. arbuscula] and black sagebrush [A. nova]); and silver sagebrush (A. cana), which occurs primarily in the northeast portion of the sage-grouse range. Invasive plant species, wildfires, and weather and climate change are major influences on sagebrush habitats and present significant challenges to their long-term conservation. Each factor is spatially pervasive across the Greater Sage-Grouse Conservation Area and has significant potential to influence processes within sagebrush communities. Cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum), the most widespread exotic annual grass, has invaded much of the lower-elevation, more xeric sagebrush landscapes across the western portion of the Greater Sage-Grouse Conservation Area. A large proportion of existing sagebrush communities are at moderate to high risk of invasion by cheatgrass. Juniper (Juniperus spp.) and pinyon (Pinus spp.) woodlands have expanded into sagebrush habitats at higher elevations creating an elevational squeeze on the sagebrush ecosystem from both extremes. Number of fires and total area burned have increased since 1980 throughout the SGCA except in the Snake River Plain, which has a long-term history of high fire disturbance. Climate change scenarios for the sagebrush region predict increasing trends in temperature, atmospheric carbon dioxide, and frequency of severe weather events that favor cheatgrass expansion and in creased fire disturbance resulting in a decline in sagebrush. Approximately 12% of the current distribution of sagebrush is predicted to be replaced by expansion of other woody vegetation for each 1 degrees C increase in temperature. Periodic drought regularly influences sagebrush ecosystems; drought duration and severity have increased throughout the 20th century in much of the interior western United States. Synergistic feedbacks among invasive plant species, fire, and climate change, coupled with current trajectories of habitat changes and rates of disturbance (natural and humancaused), will continue to change sagebrush communities and create challenges for future conservation and management.",2011,,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Zoology,WOS:000295869900013,Danny,No,No,No,Landscape/State-Province,Sage Grouse- Rangelands,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Danny,No,No,No,Sage Brush doesnt equal headwaters,

By using dendrochronological techniques, we reconstructed tree establishment at upper treeline on six mountain peaks within the Front Range and Sangre de Cristo Mountains. We compared age-structure data with climate using Spearman's rank correlation coefficients between annual and seasonal climate indexes and tree establishment dates at both regional (southern Rockies) and landscape scales (mountain range). Regime-shift analysis detected thresholds in temperature, precipitation, and tree establishment data. Tree establishment has increased substantially at upper treeline throughout the southern Rockies, leading to varying degrees of treeline advance upslope. Tree establishment in the Front Range significantly correlates with temperature, but no significant correlations with temperature variables exist in the Sangre de Cristos. Significant inverse correlations exist with precipitation but remain confined to north-facing slopes in both mountain ranges. Synchronous regime shifts (within five years) occurred in the Front Range between temperature and tree establishment during the early 1950s (1950-1954), suggesting that increasing temperatures provided a possible mechanism for abrupt increases in establishment.

Flooding caused by such events can drastically alter stream geomorphology, but much less is known about how such floods affect aquatic life. A record flood in early January 1997 afforded an opportunity to carry out a case study of benthic invertebrate community responses to this flood in 14 eastern Sierra streams sampled in the summers before and after the event. All sites were exposed to the flood. Study sites included 8 exposed to livestock grazing disturbance (test) and 6 where grazing was absent or minimal (reference). Reference sites had more riffle habitat, coarser substrata (cobbles), and greater relative abundances of many Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera (EPT) genera, whereas test sites had higher alkalinity, more pool habitats and fine substrata, lower diversity of EPT taxa, and higher densities of chironomid genera and elmid beetles. From 1996 to 1997 (before vs after the flood), the densities of total invertebrates and many taxa increased in most sites, and significantly (10X) more at test than reference sites. At all sites, bank stability and riparian vegetation coverage decreased and roots were exposed on the stream banks. At many sites, fine sediments decreased and average substrate sizes increased. Examination of 1996 to 1997 vectors in nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) space indicated differences in responses at reference vs test sites. Macroinvertebrate assemblages at reference sites changed relatively little, whereas the relative abundances of certain midges and Hydro psyche increased at test sites. Densities of filterers and small gatherers of fine particulate organic matter increased at test sites, and densities of filterers decreased at reference sites. Changes from 1996 to 1997 suggested that the winter rain-on-snow event had little effect in reference streams but increased the densities of small collector invertebrates at disturbed sites where fine sediments were flushed out and particulate organic resources increased. Given the predicted effects of climate change on mountain stream hydrology, these results indicate that benthic invertebrate communities in small pristine streams might be resilient to the effects of large rain-on-snow floods, but that small, mobile collector invertebrates in some degraded streams might increase in response to sediment flushing and increases in particulate organic matter.",2010,10.1899/09-185.1,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,WOS:000283891800014,Danny,No,Yes,No,Ecosystem/Municipal,Sierra Nevada,Danny,No,Yes,No,Ecosystem/Municipal,Sierra Nevada,NA,,,,,Danny,No,,No,Sierra Nevada,

Modern and paleo-erosion rates for a small alpine catchment (3108 m above sea level) in the Southern Rocky Mountains are measured using the cosmogenic radionuclides (CRNs) (10)Be and (26)Al in cave sediment, bedrock on the overlying landscape surface, and coarse bedload in a modern fluvial drainage. The unique setting of the Marble Mountain cave system allows the inherited erosion rates to be interpreted as basin-averaged erosion rates, resulting in the first CRN-based erosion rate record from the Rocky Mountains spanning 5 Myr. Pliocene erosion rates, derived from the oldest cave sample (4.9 +/- 0.4 Ma), for the landscape above the cave are 4.9 +/- 1.1 m Myr(-1). Mid Pleistocene erosion rates are nearly an order of magnitude higher (33.1 +/- 2.7 to 41.3 +/- 3.9 m Myr(-1)), and modern erosion rates are similar; due to the effects of snow shielding, these erosion rate estimates are likely higher than actual rates by 10-15%. The most likely explanation for this dramatic increase in erosion rates, which likely occurred shortly before 1.2 Ma, is an increase in the effectiveness of periglacial weathering processes at high elevations related to a cooler and wetter climate during the Pleistocene, providing support for the hypothesis that changes in late Cenozoic climate are responsible for increased continental erosion.

We defined coastal regions to range from the continental shelf (to a depth of 200 m), the intertidal areas and adjacent land within 100 km of the coastline. We used the 1 km resolution Global Land Cover Characteristics Database and calculated the area covered by 11 different land cover classes (natural and human-altered ecosystems) within the 100 km limit [Burke, L., Kura, Y., Kasem, K., Revenga, C., Spalding, M., McAllister, D., 2001. Coastal Ecosystems. Washington DC World Resource Institute. 93 pp.]. Cover of aquatic ecosystems was calculated based on several world databases. Our results show that the coasts of the world comprise. a wide variety of geomorphological characteristics of which mountainous coasts with a narrow shelf are the most abundant. Sandy shores are found on 16% of the coastal countries. The coasts are located in every weather regime and the number of biomes is equally variable. Within the 100 km limit, 72% still is covered by natural ecosystems and 28% have been altered by human activities (urban and croplands). Open shrubs and evergreen broadleaf forests are the most abundant terrestrial ecosystems. Canada has the largest area of natural and relatively well preserved terrestrial ecosystems. Indonesia and China have the largest percentages of cropland area near the shore, and Japan and the US have the largest coastal urban areas. Indonesia, Australia, Brazil, Bahamas and New Caledonia have the largest areas of aquatic ecosystems.

We used mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences and allele frequencies at nine microsatellite loci to examine genetic population structure across the current range of the spruce beetle (Dendroctonus rufipennis), an economically important insect in North America. Two major haplotype groups occur across northern North America, from Newfoundland to Alaska, on white spruce (Picea glauca), and a third distinctive haplotype group occurs throughout the Rocky Mountains on Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii). The two mtDNA lineages found in northern populations are 3-4% divergent from each other and from the lineages found in the Rocky Mountains. Analyses of microsatellite data also suggest the existence of major population groupings associated with different geographical regions. In the Pacific Northwest, concordant contact zones for genetically distinct populations of spruce beetles and their principal hosts appear to reflect recent secondary contact. Although we could detect no evidence of historical mtDNA gene flow between allopatric population groups, patterns of variation in the Pacific Northwest suggest recent hybridization and introgression. Together with the pollen record for spruce, they also suggest that beetles have spread from at least three glacial refugia.

Vegetation composition is dominated by elevational gradients of temperature and precipitation, but local modifications by geologic substrate, potential insolation, slope, and topographic position create finescale mosaics. Digital elevation models, geologic maps, and field data were used to map current species distributions over 6220 km(2) ( 622 000 ha) of the White and Inyo Mountains. Species - environment relationships of 88 plant species were modeled at a scale of 54 m using canonical correspondence analysis ( CCA). CCA models were calibrated from 434 field plots and evaluated with 216 plots using kappa statistics. Vegetation responses to temperature increases of 1 degrees- 6 degrees C were modeled by shifting species tolerances along the elevational gradient according to a standard lapse rate [ 3 C ( 500 m)- 1] while all other factors were kept constant. Ranges of midelevations species tended to fragment onto local peaks, whereas the ranges of many desert species merged across a major pass. In several cases, local geologic features were identified as obstacles to species' upslope migration.

In addition, many constituencies are looking to managed ecosystems to sequester carbon in plant biomass and soil C to reduce the impact of anthropogenic CO2 on climate. This work builds on a 90-year-old grazing experiment in mountain meadows on the Wasatch Plateau in central Utah. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of 90 years of protection from grazing on processes controlling the input, output, and storage of C in subalpine rangelands. Long-term grazing significantly reduced maximum biomass in all years compared with plots within grazing exclosures. For grazed plots, interannual variability in aboveground biomass was correlated with July precipitation and temperature (R-2 = 0.51), while there was a weak correlation between July precipitation and biomass in ungrazed plots (R-2 = 0.24). Livestock grazing had no statistically significant impacts on total soil C or particulate organic matter (POM), although grazing did increase active soil C and decrease soil moisture. Grazing significantly increased the proportion of total soil C pools that were potentially mineralizable in the laboratory, with soils from grazed plots evolving 4.6% of total soil C in 1 year while ungrazed plots lost 3.3% of total soil C. Volumetric soil moisture was consistently higher in ungrazed plots than grazed plots. The changes in soil C chemistry may have implications for how these ecosystems will respond to forecast climate change.

In the absence of long-term environmental data, the impacts of these stressors are not well understood. Long-term effects of environmental change on diatom species assemblages were assessed in the sediments of 16 New Brunswick lakes using paleolimnological approaches. A regional trend of increasing Cyclotella stelligera Cleve & Gunrow and decreasing Aulacoseira species complex was recorded in most lakes. Detailed paleolimnological analyses of Wolfe, Cundy, and West Long lakes revealed varying degrees of species change, with assemblage shifts beginning ca. 1900 CE (common era). These species trends are not consistent with acidification. However, linear regression of mean July temperature with time for two New Brunswick historical instrumental temperature records revealed statistically significant warming over the past century. The shift from heavily silicified tychoplanktonic Aulacoseira species to small planktonic diatom species, such as C. stelligera, is consistent with paleolimnological inferences of warming trends recorded in several other lake regions of the Northern Hemisphere.

Yet as these methods have developed, investigating the quality of the underlying specimen data has largely been neglected. Using an exceptionally large, densely sampled specimen data set for non-flying small mammals of Utah, I evaluate measures of uncertainty associated with georeferenced localities and illustrate the implications of uncritical incorporation of data in the analysis of patterns of species richness and species range overlap along elevational gradients. Location Utah, USA, with emphasis on the Uinta Mountains. Methods Employing georeferenced specimen data from the Mammal Networked Information System (MaNIS), I converted estimates of areal uncertainty into elevational uncertainty using a geographic information system (GIS). Examining patterns in both areal and elevational uncertainty measures, I develop criteria for including localities in analyses along elevational gradients. Using the Uinta Mountains as a test case, I then examine patterns in species richness and species range overlap along an elevational gradient, with and without accounting for data quality. Results Using a GIS, I provide a framework for post-hoc 3-dimensional georeferencing and demonstrate collector-recorded elevations as a valuable technique for detecting potential errors in georeferencing. The criteria established for evaluating data quality when analysing patterns of species richness and species range overlap in the Uinta Mountains test case reduced the number of localities by 44% and the number of associated specimens by 22%. Decreasing the sample size in this manner resulted in the subsequent removal of one species from the analysis. With and without accounting for data quality, the pattern of species richness along the elevational gradient was hump-shaped with a peak in richness at about mid-elevation, between 2300 and 2600 m. In contrast, the frequencies of different pair-wise patterns of elevational range overlap among species differed significantly when data quality was and was not accounted for. Main conclusions These results indicate that failing to assess spatial error in data quality did not alter the shape of the observed pattern in species richness along the elevational gradient nor the pattern of species' first and last elevational occurrences.

In this study, we investigate the influence of drought and topography on recent patterns of tree mortality in old-growth mixed conifer forests in Yosemite National Park, located in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of northern California, USA. The surveyed stands have experienced a century of fire exclusion and are dominated by associations of Pinus ponderosa, Calocedrus decurrens and Abies concolor. The average age of trees in the stands was 88 years. We sought answers to the following questions: (1) Do periods of high tree mortality correspond with drought? (2) Do spatial and temporal patterns of high tree mortality vary by slope aspect? and (3) Do different tree species exhibit similar temporal and spatial patterns of tree mortality? We identified temporal patterns of tree mortality on three north- and south-facing slopes by determining the death date of trees using dendrochronology. Tree death date frequency was then compared by slope aspect and to Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), and April snowpack depth as measures of growing season water availability. The frequency of tree death dates was negatively correlated with annual and seasonal PDSI and April snowpack depth, and more trees died in years with below normal PDSI and snowpack. Correlations between tree mortality and drought were evident only for multi-year periods (2-5 years). Temporal patterns of tree death were similar on north- and south-facing slopes and among species, but the density of dead trees was higher on north than south slopes. Dense stand conditions caused by fire suppression, and the coincident outbreak of bark beetles during drought, may have limited any buffering effect of topography on tree mortality. Drought induced tree mortality in mixed conifer forests in Yosemite National Park highlights the importance of both historical legacies such as fire suppression and exogenous controls such as climate as drivers of vegetation change.

Dominance of small benthic Fragilaria diatoms reflect the generally cold conditions with long periods of ice cover that have characterized these mountain lakes over at least the last similar to 300 years until the period of recent warming. At the turn of the 20th century, salient shifts in the diatom assemblages reveal individualistic limnological responses with the onset of climate warming trends in northwest Canada. At YK3 Lake, an oligotrophic, chemically dilute, alpine lake, increased representation of the planktonic Cyclotella pseudostelligera may reflect longer ice-free conditions and/or more stable thermal strati. cation. By contrast, in the more productive, alkaline lakes (BC2 and Deadspruce lakes), changes to more diverse assemblages of periphytic diatoms suggest greater benthic habitat availability, most likely associated with the enhanced growth of aquatic plants with lengthening of the growing seasons. In addition, diatom assemblages from these lakes suggest less alkaline conditions following the onset of 20th century climate warming. Continued alkalinity reduction throughout the 20th century is qualitatively inferred at the lower elevation, treeline lake (Deadspruce Lake), while greater representation of alkaliphilous Fragilaria diatoms after similar to 1950 suggested increased alkalinity at the alpine BC2 Lake. Our results confirm the sensitivity of diatoms from high-elevation mountain lakes to regional climate change in northwest Canada. Individualistic limnological responses to 20th century warming are potentially attributed to differences in their physical setting (e. g., bedrock geology, elevation, catchment vegetation) in this complex mountain environment.",2005,10.1007/s10933-004-5334-9,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,WOS:000227704300002,Meghan,No,Yes,No,,,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Danny,No,,No,NW BC,

Our 42 study sites encompass widely varying climatic and erosional regimes, with mean annual temperatures ranging from 2 to 25 degreesC, average precipitation ranging from 22 to 420 cm(.)year(-1), and denudation rates ranging from 23 to 755 t(.)km(-2) (.) year(-1). Long-term chemical weathering rates range from 0 to 173 t.km(-2) year(-1), in several cases exceeding the highest granitic weathering rates on record from previous work. Chemical weathering rates are highest at the sites with rapid denudation rates, consistent with strong coupling between rates of chemical weathering and mineral supply from breakdown of rock. A simple empirical relationship based on temperature, precipitation and long-term denudation rates explains 89-95% of the variation in long-term weathering rates across our network of sites. Our analysis shows that, for a given precipitation and temperature, chemical weathering rates increase proportionally with fresh-material supply rates. We refer to this as ""supply-limited"" weathering, in which fresh material is chemically depleted to roughly the same degree, regardless of its rate of supply from breakdown of rock. The temperature sensitivity of chemical weathering rates is two to four times smaller than what one would expect from laboratory measurements of activation energies for feldspar weathering and previous inter-comparisons of catchment mass-balance data from the field. Our results suggest that climate change feedbacks between temperature and silicate weathering rates may be weaker than previously thought, at least in actively eroding, unglaciated terrain similar to our study sites. To the extent that chemical weathering rates are supply-limited in mountainous landscapes, factors that,regulate rates of mineral supply from erosion, such as tectonic uplift, may lead to significant fluctuations in global climate over the long term.

Additionally, magnetic susceptibility aids assessment of the intensity of pedogenesis. Bulk magnetic susceptibility (chi(b)) through the section repeatedly fluctuates between low values (average 3.51 x 10(-8) +/- 1.59 x 10(-8) m(3)/kg) in parent loessite and higher values (average 5.70 x 10(-8) +/- 2.70 x 10(-8) m(3)/kg) in paleosols. Moreover, magnetic susceptibility positively correlates with abundance of clay-sized material as well as Al2O3 and K2O and effectively distinguishes Protosols and Argillisols. Low-temperature demagnetization indicates the presence of ultra-fine-grained magnetite. The integration of geochemical, petrographic, and rock magnetic data suggest that changes in magnetic susceptibility reflect pedogenesis and relate primarily to climate- and time-dependent pedogenic production and concentration of ultra-fine-grained magnetite. The Maroon Formation loess and associated soils accumulated in an overall and system, documented in part by formation of incipiently formed paleosols developed into Argillisols by eolian clay and carbonate additions rather than by in situ clay formation.

Soil C and N concentrations and masses were significantly higher in the grazed than in the ungrazed area, though grass leaf N was higher in the ungrazed area, as was vegetation biomass. Detectable amounts of CO2 were lost from the grazed and ungrazed areas of this grassland during the winters of 1998, 1999, and 2000, and at 6 of 15 winter flux sample dates, CO2 efflux was greater in the grazed area than in the ungrazed area. The ungrazed area consistently gained more C during the summer months than the grazed area, with net CO2 exchange peaking in mid-July 1998 at nearly 5 mumol m(-2) s(-1) in the ungrazed area compared to <2 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) in the grazed area. During the 2-yr study period, the grazed area was a carbon source of 170 g C m-2, while the ungrazed area was a carbon sink of 83 g C m(-2). Lower N mineralization rates early and late in the summer (1999) in the grazed site at Libby Flats corresponded to reductions in net CO2 exchange and lower plant N content compared to the ungrazed exclosure. Based on these results, we suggest that: (1) long-term grazing in high-altitude rangelands can alter annual CO2 exchange and N dynamics; (2) temporal synchrony in C and N processes occur during the summer; that is, increased C exchange rates accompany increased N mineralization rates; and (3) integrative (total soil C and N) and instantaneous (CO2 exchange and vegetation N) measures of C and N dynamics may not necessarily lead to the same interpretation regarding C sequestration and N cycling in alpine grasslands.",2004,10.1657/1523-0430(2004)036[0011:AGCEAN]2.0.CO;2,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Physical Geography,WOS:000222951100002,Meghan,Maybe,Yes,No,Biome/National,"Alpine grazing regions, effects of grazing on CO2",NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Danny,No,,No,Medicine Bow,

This upward migration of lowland species will surely result in contact with related species inhabiting high-mountain ecosystems. We propose that an overlooked consequence of this upland movement is the possibility for interspecific hybridization between narrowly endemic alpine plants and widely distributed lowland plants. Genetic swamping due to introgressive hybridization might even lead to the genetic extinction of the endemic species, without any apparent detrimental demographic effect. Unfortunately, this phenomenon has long been ignored in the ecological literature, probably because is widely assumed that the ecological effects of climate change are more detrimental than its genetic effects. We tested our idea by searching for human-induced hybridization in a worldwide hotspot biodiversity, the high-mountains of the Sierra Nevada (south-eastern Spain). About 25 % of the endemic flora is already hybridizing in these mountains, mostly with widespread lowland congeners. Some species are even already threatened due to genetic swamping. It is thereby urgent including in future conservation agendas a protocol for detecting and monitoring positive and negative effects of genetic swamping mediated by climate change in high mountains and other sensitive ecosystems.",2015,10.1007/s10531-015-0909-5,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WOS:000358643500001,Micah,No,Yes,No,,Spain ,NA,,,,,,Courtney,No,Yes,No,Southeast Spain,Danny,No,,International,Spain ,

To determine the effects of pollen availability, temperature, and pollinators on seed production in the alpine, we combined pollen-manipulation experiments with measurements of variation in temperature, and abundance and diversity of potential pollinators along a 400-m elevation gradient. We did this for seven dominant species of flowering plants in the Coast Range Mountains, British Columbia, Canada. The number of viable seeds set by plants was influenced by pollen limitation (quantity of pollen received), mate limitation (quality of pollen), temperature, abundance of potential pollinators, seed predation, and combinations of these factors. Early flowering species (n = 3) had higher seed set at high elevation and late-flowering species (n = 4) had higher seed set at low elevation. Degree-days >15 degrees C were good predictors of seed set, particularly in bee-pollinated species, but had inconsistent effects among species. Seed production in one species, Arnica latifolia, was negatively affected by seed-predators (Tephritidae) at mid elevation, where there were fewer frost-hours during the flowering season. Anemone occidentalis, a fly-pollinated, self-compatible species had high seed set at all elevations, likely due to abundant potential pollinators. Simultaneously measuring multiple factors affecting reproductive success of flowering plants helped identify which factors were most important, providing focus for future studies.

Here we report evidence of conditions substantially wetter than today from fluvial tufa deposits located near Zaca Lake, Santa Barbara County, California that have been dated by radiocarbon (C-14) and Infra-Red Stimulated Luminescence (IRSL). Two successions of tufa deposition occur within a small catchment that drains Miocene Monterey Formation bedrock: 1) a fluvial deposit (0-0.5 m thick, 200 m in extent) that formed along a narrow valley below a modern spring, and 2) a perched deposit similar to 10 m higher (2 m thick, 15 m in extent). IRSL and radiocarbon dating of the perched carbonates suggest at least two episodes of carbonate growth: one at 19.4 +/- 2.4 (1 sigma.) through 17.8 +/- 2.8 (1 sigma) ka and another at 11.9 +/- 1.5 (1 sigma.) ka verified with a charcoal C-14 age of 10.95 +/- 0.12 (2 sigma) cal ka BP. The relationship between the perched and fluvial spring deposits is inferred to represent a drop in the water table of more than 10 m associated with a transition from a wet climate in the late glacial to a dry Holocene today. The wet period indicated by the perched tufa deposit between 19.4 and 17.8 ka is relatively consistent with other California climate records both north and south of Zaca Lake. However, tufa growth ca. 12 to 11 ka demonstrates wet conditions occurred as far south as Zaca Lake during the Younger Dryas event, in contrast to climate records farther south in Lake Elsinore that indicate a drying trend through this interval. A small shift north in the average position of the winter season storm track could explain wet winters at Zaca while at the same time generating dry winters at Lake Elsinore, similar to 275 km southwest of Zaca. If true, these data indicate that rather small latitudinal shifts in the average winter season storm track can produce large changes in regional hydroclimate. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Because our collective understanding of rates of deposition and erosion are widely utilized to constrain the importance of active tectonism and climate forcing in shaping the surface of our planet, cognizance of the dependence of rate on duration of observation is of critical importance. Relations between elevation change (deposition, erosion) and rate scaling laws have often been examined by stochastic random walk simulations, but this approach is generally confounded by insufficient data on amounts of land-surface change, on durations of land-surface change, and on hiatal durations separating time intervals of change. Deposition or erosion rates measured over short intervals, such as during floods, are usually too large to be sustained over geologic timescales, and this difference implies that hiatuses of consequential duration must separate intervals of incision and/or deposition. While it has been argued that hiatuses may have a truncated power law distribution (reflecting the largely stochastic nature of processes in time and space), we (collectively) lack adequate data on magnitudes and temporal distributions of natural depositional and/or erosional events in many geologic systems to fully understand their relations. Abundantly available data on meteoric precipitation (rainfall), comprising precipitation amounts, precipitation durations, and drought durations at different timescales and from different climatic settings, are an attractive analogue for longer-term processes of deposition and erosion that can only be inferred from incomplete geologic data. Here, manifestations and reasons for the Sadler effect are examined in a region of relatively discontinuous meteoric sedimentation as recorded by 2,311 precipitation (and intervening hiatus) events over the past 63 yr in Las Vegas, Nevada. Collectively, these data suggest several conclusions. (1) Frequencies of rainfall magnitude, rainfall duration, and intervening hiatuses are closely approximated by exponential amount and duration frequency distributions; quantities and lengths of precipitation are more or less randomly partitioned in length-time space. (2) The negative power law dependence of precipitation rate on measurement interval is largely unrelated to the progressive inclusion or exclusion of longer or shorter intervals of precipitation or drought over longer or shorter durations of consideration. (3) Dependence of precipitation rate on total (rainfall plus hiatal) duration, manifested as positive covariance in total duration and amount, only becomes apparent among the Las Vegas data when durations span more than several years. Over shorter time spans, the stochastic nature of synoptic weather systems imparts steep negative power law covariance to duration versus rate relations; over longer durations, the influence of Las Vegas climate becomes increasingly apparent as variation in precipitation amounts is increasingly explained by total duration. (4) Actuality of the Sadler effect in Las Vegas rainfall data, manifested as the negative dependence of log-scaled rate on measurement duration, primarily reflects the degree of correspondence between amount and duration. These tenets are further examined in light of recently published data on cumulative durations and rates of bedrock incision. These degradational systems largely exhibit negative power law rate duration slopes, a trend previously interpreted as reflecting some sort of dependence of incision rate on measurement interval. However, when viewed in a context of precipitation as meteoric sediment, these erosional data are more readily understood as largely reflecting the degree of correlation between per-event durations and amounts of incision among the various river systems under consideration.",2015,10.1086/681588,Geology,WOS:000354138300001,Micah,No,Yes,No,,CO,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Danny,No,,No,CO,

These comparable results are encouraging for the continued use of citizen science monitoring programs, which can save both time and expense while involving and educating the public about threatened species.

We used a rarefaction approach to model species richness for the four taxonomic groups and analyzed those groups by habitat type, elevation zone, and time period. We then mapped the spatial distributions of species richness values for the four taxonomic groups, as well as total species richness, for the Parks. We also estimated changes in species richness for birds, mammals, and herpetofauna since 1980. The modeled patterns of species richness either peaked at mid elevations (mammals, plants, and total species richness) or declined consistently with increasing elevation (herpetofauna and birds). Plants reached maximum species richness values at much higher elevations than did vertebrate taxa, and nonflying mammals reached maximum species richness values at higher elevations than did birds. Alpine plant communities, including sagebrush, had higher species richness values than did subalpine plant communities located below them in elevation. These results are supported by other papers published in the scientific literature. Perhaps reflecting climate change: birds and herpetofauna displayed declines in species richness since 1980 at low and middle elevations and mammals displayed declines in species richness since 1980 at all elevations.",2014,10.1371/journal.pone.0112465,Science & Technology - Other Topics,WOS:000349128700008,Micah,No,Yes,No,,CA,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Danny,No,,No,CA,

In looking toward the future, much can be learned from examining faunal response under past episodes of environmental change. Typically, retrospective approaches are limited to one spatial and temporal scale. Here, we illustrate how integrating across spatiotemporal scales can provide powerful insights into faunal response, and can inform conservation and management. To do this we compare paleontological and neontological studies on the small mammal fauna of the Great Basin. Small mammal species and their assemblages have long been recognized as indicators of ecological change and ecosystem health. We use fossil data from two long-term owl roosts to reconstruct patterns of richness and the apportioning of abundance among functional groups across multiple episodes of warming during the Holocene (last 10,000 years). We then use these findings as a climate-only baseline against which to compare changes in richness and abundance in 2 independent mountain ranges over the past century.

This tradeoff is intensified in alpine environments, which are characterized by cold and variable conditions. We monitored the incubation rhythms of alpine Horned Larks (Eremophila alpestris) in British Columbia, Canada, across different annual thermal regimes (2005: moderate; 2006: warm; 2010: cold overnight; 2011: cold during the day). In this species, females. alone incubated and left their nests to forage at dawn, following 7 hr of nighttime incubation in near-freezing conditions. However, with early morning ambient temperatures still <5 degrees C, this placed embryos at high risk of chilling during incubation recesses. Focusing on behavioral decisions made by females at dawn (06:00-08:00 hours), we examined relationships between incubation rhythms and ambient temperature among years for evidence of variable responses to temperature. In all years, females spent more time off the nest at dawn in warmer temperatures, but in 2010, which was colder overnight, the slope of the line relating attentiveness to ambient temperature was steeper, indicating that females left their nests at colder temperatures compared with other years. In 2010 females also took shorter recesses at cold temperatures. Hatching success remained high in 2010 relative to warm or moderate years; however, overwinter survival of females declined to 48% from 2010 to 2011 compared with 72% in earlier years. When faced with exceptional thermal constraints, alpine Horned Larks made behavioral adjustments to their incubation rhythms and were able to maintain fecundity.

Franco. We investigated the population genetics and impact associated with the first recorded outbreak of DFTM in southern California (USA), and report the first collection of DFTM in Baja California Norte, Mexico. This latter population is similar genetically to populations from Washington, USA and British Columbia, Canada. We assessed forest stand characteristics, levels of defoliation, and mortality of white fir, Abies concolor Lindl., associated with the DFTM outbreak in the Transverse Mountain Ranges of southern California. We compared these data to those from southern California non-outbreak stands of A. concolor, and from virgin stands with an A. concolor component in the Sierra San Pedro Martir National Park (Mexico). Total stand density (ha(-1)) was significantly higher (22%) in non-outbreak stands than in outbreak stands. However, outbreak stands had significantly higher mortality of A. concolor than non-outbreak stands [whether expressed as density (70%) or basal area (m(2) ha(-1)) (32%)]. Total stand and A. concolor density and basal area for living and dead trees were significantly lower in the Sierra San Pedro Martir National Park than in southern California. Dead A. concolor comprised >95% of all tree mortality in both outbreak and non-outbreak areas in southern California, which corresponded to a mean 20% basal area loss of A. concolor associated with DFTM feeding injury within the outbreak area. The mean level of defoliation of A. concolor by DFTM was 39%, and 62% of all dead A. concolor were associated with DFTM defoliation. In stands with high levels of defoliation, larval feeding and tree mortality were also noted in Jeffrey pine, Pinus jeffreyi Grey. 82 Balf. The amount of dead A. concolor basal area associated with the fir engraver, Scolytus ventralis LeConte (Coleoptera: Scolytidae), in non-outbreak stands was 96% greater than in outbreak stands.

Bark and ambrosia beetles are important biotic factors regulating forest ecosystems, especially tree-killing species that can reach outbreak levels. In a recent study we found that although endemic-level Dendroctonus ponderosae, a tree-killing bark beetle, preferentially colonized fire-injured Pinus contorta (lodgepole pine) after prescribed fire, colonization rates decreased consistently over a 3-year period after an initial pulse. This decline may be due in part to an increase in the abundance of the subcortical community, especially competitors such as other bark beetles and ambrosia beetles. Additionally, while bark and ambrosia beetles can be attracted to fire-injured trees, we do not yet fully understand the temporal progression of the insect community in burned forest stands, and whether other species can outbreak after fire. Thus, our main objective was to characterize the bark and ambrosia beetle community and to examine if a disturbance (fire) can mediate the regulation of a tree-killing bark beetle by intensifying competition. We divided beetles into four groups: lower-, main-, and upper-stem bark beetles, and ambrosia beetles. We found that all groups generally increased in abundance after fire, and we observed a time-lag of approximately 1 year in the overall abundance of all species, wherein beetles increased in burned stands more rapidly than in non-burned stands. All groups were present in burned pine stands 1 year after fire, albeit at varying abundances relative to subsequent years. Finally, we found differences in the bark and ambrosia beetle community between areas with and without D. ponderosae: areas with D. ponderosae contained more bark and ambrosia beetles. Thus, fire likely increases competition, explaining why an initial increase in D. ponderosae colonization did not result in a long-term population increase after prescribed fire.

Phylogeographic patterns of range expansion in trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) suggested that Beringia is likely to be a refugium and the ""ice-free corridor"" in Alberta may represent a region where small populations persisted during the last glacial maximum (LGM). The purpose of this study was to ascertain whether the origins of trembling aspen in western North America are reflected in the patterns of neutral genetic diversity and population structure. A total of 28 sites were sampled covering the northwestern part of aspen's distribution, from Saskatchewan to Alaska. Twelve microsatellite markers were used to describe patterns of genetic diversity. The genetic structure of trembling aspen populations was assessed by using multivariate analyses, Mantel correlograms, neighbor-joining trees and Bayesian analysis. Results: Microsatellite markers revealed little to no neutral genetic structure of P. tremuloides populations in northwestern North America. Low differentiation among populations and small isolation by distance (IBD) were observed. The most probable number of clusters detected by STRUCTURE was K = 3 (Delta K = 5.9). The individuals in the populations of the 3 clusters share a common gene pool and showed a high level of admixture. No evidence was found that either Beringia or the ""ice-free corridor"" were refugia. Highest allelic richness (AR) and lowest heterozygosity (H-o) were observed in Alberta foothills of the Rocky Mountains. Conclusions: Contrary to our hypothesis, our results showed that microsatellite markers revealed little to no genetic structure in P. tremuloides populations. Consequently, no divergent populations were observed near supposed refugia. The lack of detectable refugia in Beringia and in the ""ice-free corridor"" was due to high levels of gene flow between trembling apsen populations. More favorable environmental conditions for sexual reproduction and successful trembling aspen seedling establishment may have contributed to increase allelic richness through recombination in populations from the Albertan foothills of the Rocky Mountains.",2016,10.1186/s12862-016-0810-1,Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,WOS:000386028400003,Paris,Yes,No,No,,does not address climate change,Micah,No,No,No,Lanscape/State-province,Canada/AK,NA,,,,,Danny,No,No,No,does not address climate change,

This study tested the effect of digital elevation model ( DEM) resolution on model accuracy and estimates of the sensitivity of ecohydrologic responses to inter-annual climate variability. The Regional Hydro-Ecologic Simulation System ( RHESSys) was applied to eight headwater, high-elevation watersheds located in the Kings River drainage basin. Each watershed was calibrated with measured snow depth ( or snow water equivalent) and daily streamflow. Modeled streamflow estimates were sensitive to DEM resolution, even with resolution-specific calibration of soil drainage parameters. For model resolutions coarser than 10 m, the accuracy of streamflow estimates largely decreased. Reduced model accuracy was related to the reduction in spatial variance of a topographic wetness index with coarser DEM resolutions. This study also found that among the long-term average ecohydrologic estimates, summer flow estimates were the most sensitive to DEM resolution, and coarser resolution models overestimated the climatic sensitivity for evapotranspiration and net primary productivity. Therefore, accounting for fine-scale topographic variability in ecohydrologic modeling may be necessary for reliably assessing climate change effects on lower-order Sierra Nevada watersheds (<= 2.3 km(2)).",2016,10.3390/w8080321,Water Resources,WOS:000380765200010,Paris,No,Yes,No,,CA,Becky,No,Yes,No,,"California's Sierra Nevada, King's River Basin drainage",NA,,,,,Danny,No,Yes,No,California,

Subdivided into the southern Pacific Ranges, central Kitimat Ranges and northern Boundary Ranges, the majority of large glaciers and icefields are located in the Boundary and Pacific ranges. Prior descriptions of the Holocene glacial history of this region indicate the Holocene was characterized by repeated episodes of ice expansion and retreat. Recent site-specific investigations augment our understanding of the regional character and duration of these events. In this paper, previously reported and new radiocarbon evidence is integrated to provide an updated regional assessment. The earliest evidence of glacier expansion in the Coast Mountains comes from the Boundary Ranges at 8.9 and 7.8 ka and in the Pacific Ranges at 8.5-8.2 ka, with the latter advance corresponding to an interval of rapid, global climate deterioration. Although generally warm and dry climates from 73 to 5.3 ka likely limited the size of glaciers in the region, there is radiocarbon evidence for advances over the interval from 7.3 to 6.0 and at 5.4-5.3 ka in the Pacific Ranges. Following these advances, glaciers in the Pacific Ranges expanded down valley at 4.8-4.6, 4.4-4.0, 3.5-2.6,1.4-1.2, and 0.8-0.4 ka, while glaciers in Boundary Ranges were advancing at 4.1-4.0, 3.7-3.4, 3.1-2.8, 2.3, 1.7-1.1, and 0.8-0.4 ka. After 0.4 ka, it appears that most glaciers in the Coast Mountains continued to expand to attain their maximum Holocene extents by the early 18th to late 19th centuries. This enhanced record of Holocene glacier activity highlights the temporal synchrony in the Coast Mountains. Individual expansion events in the mid-to late Holocene broadly correspond to intervals of regional glacier activity reported in the Canadian Rocky Mountains, in Alaska, and on high-elevation volcanic peaks in Washington State.

These changes should in turn affect soil formation processes. The aim of this study was to identify possible consequences for soils in a dry-alpine region with respect to weathering of primary minerals and leaching of elements under expected vegetation and climate changes. To achieve this, a field empirical approach investigating an attitudinal sequence was used in combination with laboratory weathering experiments simulating several scenarios. The study sites are located in Sinks Canyon and Stough Basin of the Wind River Range, Wyoming, USA. The following sites (from moist to dry with increasing temperature along the sequence) were investigated: 10 soil profiles (Typic Haplocryoll) in a tundra ecotone, 10 soil profiles (Ustic Haplocryoll) in a pine-fir forest and 20 soil profiles (Ustic Argicryoll) in sagebrush. All soils developed on granitoid moraines. Soil mineralogy was analysed using cathodoluminescence and X-ray diffraction. This revealed that biotite and plagioclase were both weathered to smectite while plagioclase also weathered to kaolinite. Cooler, wetter, altitude-dependent conditions promoted weathering of primary minerals. Furthermore, the soils of the tundra and forest zone exhibited a higher acidity and more organic carbon. In a series of wet laboratory batch experiments, materials from topsoils (A horizons) and subsoils (B horizons) in each ecotone were examined alone or in combination with other samples. In a first step, aqueous extracts of the topsoil samples were generated in batch reactors and analysed for the main ions. In a second and a third step the topsoil extracts were reacted with the subsoil samples of the same ecotone, and with the subsoil samples of the ecotones at higher altitude. The total duration of these batch experiments was 1800 h, and the solutes were measured using ICP-OES and ion chromatography. Dissolved Ca, Mg and K were mainly controlled by the chemical weathering of oligoclase, K-feldspar and biotite. With increasing altitude the total concentrations of Ca, Mg and K in the aqueous extracts decreased, the relative ionic contribution from K decreased, while the ionic contribution from Ca increased. Climate change (warming, changed precipitation) potentially will reduce weathering intensity, soil acidity and the content of organic carbon. An attitudinal shift in vegetation due to climate change seems to affect the ionic composition of the soil solution. In the case of a shift from forest to sagebrush and tundra to forest or sagebrush, the relative contribution from K would increase at the expense of Ca. We hypothesise that K will play an important role in future biogeochemical cycles under the assumptions of climate warming and subsequent vegetation shifts to higher altitudes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

After nearly 25 years, lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia) forests that regenerated after the 1988 Yellowstone Fires (Wyoming, USA) offer a prime opportunity to track the fate of disturbance-created heterogeneity in stand structure and function in a wilderness setting. In 2012, we resampled 72 permanent plots to ask (1) How have postfire stand structure and function changed between 11 and 24 yr postfire, and what variables explain these patterns and changes? (2) How has landscape-level (among-stand) variability in postfire stand structure and function changed between 11 and 24 yr postfire? We expected to see evidence of convergence beginning to emerge, but also that initial postfire stem density would still determine trajectories of biomass accumulation. After 24 yr, postfire lodgepole pine density remained very high (mean = 21,738 stems/ha, range = 0-344,067 stems/ha). Stem density increased in most plots between 11 and 24 yr postfire, but declined sharply where 11-yr-postfire stem density was >72,000 stems/ha. Stems were small in high-density stands, but stand-level lodgepole pine leaf area, foliage biomass, and live aboveground biomass increased over time and with increasing stem density. After 24 yr, mean annual lodgepole pine aboveground net primary production (ANPP) was high (mean = 5 Mg.ha(-1).yr(-1), range = 0-16.5 Mg.ha(-1).yr(-1)). Among stands, lodgepole pine ANPP increased with stem density, which explained 69% of the variation; another 8% of the variation was explained by environmental covariates. Early patterns of postfire lodgepole pine regeneration, which were contingent on prefire serotiny and fire severity, remained the dominant driver of stand structure and function. We observed mechanisms that would lead to convergence in stem density (structure) over time, but it was landscape variation in functional variables that declined substantially. Stand structure and function have not converged across the burned landscape, but our evidence suggests function will converge sooner than structure.",2016,10.1890/15-1585.1,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WOS:000375566800015,Paris,Yes,Yes,Yes,Ecosystem/Municipal,Greater Yellowstone,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Danny,Yes,Maybe,No,Greater Yellowstone,

Boulderrich alluvial fan deposits overlie the Farson Sandstone adjacent to the Continental Fault, and correlate basinward to hypersaline lacustrine deposits of the Wilkins Peak Member. The alluvial fan deposits record a period of reverse motion on the Continental Fault and uplift of the southeastern Wind River Range, which diverted drainage away from the greater Green River Basin. This decreased inflow caused Lake Gosiute to shrink, exposing its bed to desiccation and erosion, and contributed to hydrologically- closed conditions and periodic evaporite deposition thereafter. This study is one of the first to demonstrate a direct relationship between movement along a specific basin-bounding structure, and a change in the overall style of lacustrine sedimentation.

The lower Cutler beds consist of similar to250 m of lithified eolian silt (loessite) and marine-reworked and fluvially reworked loessite, with abundant intercalated paleosols comprising Protosols, Argillisols, and Calcisols. The evolution from loessite and marine-reworked loessite with abundant Calcisols in the lower section to loessite and fluvially reworked loessite with abundant Argillisols in the upper section records a long-term transition from semiarid conditions in western equatorial Pangea in latest Pennsylvanian time to seasonally wet conditions in earliest Permian time. This shift could record intensification of the Pangean megamonsoon and associated seasonal incursions of moisture-laden westerlies. Paleosols record relatively high-frequency fluctuations between drier, dustier glacials and wetter interglacials of the late Paleozoic. Bulk magnetic-susceptibility values in paleosols exhibit variations that track paleosol type and are significantly elevated relative to parent loessite, attributable to the occurrence of both ultrafine-grained (superparamagnetic) and coarser-grained (remanence-carrying) magnetite. This signature reflects in situ pedogenic production of ferrimagnetic phases and a subordinate component of allochthonous, magnetic dust influx during pedogenesis, analogous to processes inferred for the magnetic signature in the Pliocene-Pleistocene loess-paleosol sequences of, e.g., the Chinese Loess Plateau. Integration of sedimentologic, geochemical, and magnetic data further suggests that enhancement of magnetic susceptibility in loessitic paleosols of this section relates primarily to climatic conditions and secondarily to durations of pedogenesis. Whereas peak susceptibility values in mature paleosols (Argillisols and Calcisols) do not vary significantly through the study section, peak values for Protosols track facies evidence for wetter conditions through time. Accordingly, relative changes in paleosol susceptibility values can provide paleoclimatic information, but should be integrated with other data to fully assess the origin of the signature. Overall, our data document the applicability of analytical approaches used on recent loess to very ancient loessite; this result is significant, because loess commonly records high-resolution evidence of terrestrial climate and climate change.",2002,,Geology,WOS:000177389400008,Shana,No,Maybe,No,,Utah,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Danny,No,,No,Utah,

Three zones of distinct pollen, plant macrofossil, and chironomid assemblages are apparent in the sediment core from 3M Pond (informal name). A dry, sparsely vegetated spruce parkland and a warm-adapted chironomid community existed in and around the study sites in the early Holocene (ca. 10,000 to 7000 C-14 yr BP). Between 7000 and 3500 C-14 Yr BP, Engelmann spruce-subalpine fir forest conditions established and then declined around 3M Pond leading to modern subalpine parkland conditions from 3500 C-14 yr BP to present. Chironomid communities at 3M Pond between 7000 and 3500 C-14 yr BP are indicative of warmer waters than present, but show a transition to modern assemblages. Three climatic regimes are identified near Stoyoma Mountain: (1) the early Holocene xerothermic period (10,000 to 7000 C-14 yr BP, (2) a period of climatic transition in the mid-Holocene (7000 to 3500 C-14 yr BP), and (3) cool, modern neoglacial conditions (after 3500 C-14 yr BP). These findings confirm vegetation and inferred climate changes identified at Cabin Lake, British Columbia (a nearby lake in the subalpine forest).

Tree-ring chronologies of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca (Beissn.) France), subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa (Hook.) Nutt.), and interior spruce (Picea engelmannii Parry x P. glauca (Moench) Voss) were developed for the Model Forest. Response function analysis showed that (1) Douglas-fir is the most climate sensitive species, and its radial growth is mainly controlled by spring precipitation and early summer temperature, and (2) the ring growth of subalpine fir and spruce is negatively affected by high summer temperature. Comparisons of the tree-ring chronologies among the three species revealed dynamics of growth releases and suppressions which reflected climate variations and forest disturbance patterns in the past several centuries. The climate during the late 1750s-1800s was characterized by slightly moist springs and probably moderate summers. During the late 1860s and early 1870s, the region experienced dry springs, hot summers, and probably cold late falls. This study identified three intervals of major disturbances attributable to severe spruce beetle outbreaks: the Bate 1720s, 1810s-1820s, and 1960s-early 1980s. These coincided with periods of above average growth in Douglas-fir. The association suggested a possible moist spring-outbreak pattern. The multicentury tree-ring records of climate anomalies and spruce beetle outbreaks could provide insight into the dynamics of forest growth and its response to environmental changes.

We used pollen preserved in meadow soils to investigate the long-term interaction of these factors in a 1-ha subalpine meadow in the Olympic Mountains, Washington, USA. 2 To describe the spatial scale at which soil pollen is related to neighbouring vegetation, pollen in 46 soil surface samples was compared with plant cover within concentric circular plots (0.5-1 m radii). Regression analysis of percentage pollen with plant cover at different distances from the surface sample had the highest correlation with radii < 1 m, confirming that entomophilous meadow species have very small relevant pollen source areas. 3 We analysed pollen records in soil columns at three sites representing a range of growing season lengths and community types within the meadow. Soils had aggraded by the deposition of eolian silt. Radiocarbon dates of pollen concentrates were similar to or older than radiocarbon dates on charcoal pieces at the same depth, suggesting negligible downwards movement of pollen in the soil profile. 4 The oldest soil pollen profile was from the wettest microsite, currently dominated by a snowbed Carex nigricans community. This site was occupied by a dry Juniperus community prior to c. 6000 BP (before present), when it shifted to more mesic communities dominated by Poaceae and Polemonium. The first appearance of a snowbed Calex nigricans community at this site, c, 2500-1500 BP suggests a change to cooler and/or wetter regional climate. 5 High levels of Polygonum bistortoides at all sites indicated a shift to long snow-free periods and mesic summer conditions during an interval corresponding to the Medieval Warm Period (c. 1200-700 BP). After 500 BP (during the Little Ice Age) Carex nigricans re-established in the wet microsite, while relatively little change occurred at the other two sites. Overall, the greater magnitude of change at this microsite than at the longer growing-season sites indicates that, in these subalpine meadows, short growing season sites are most sensitive to regional climate change.",1999,10.1046/j.1365-2745.1999.00335.x,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WOS:000078762300010,Shana,No,Yes,No,,Olympic Mtns,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Danny,No,,No,Olympic Mtns,

We also compared the butterfly fauna of the Toquima Range to that of the adjacent Toiyabe Range, which is more topographically complex and species rich but less representative of the Great Basin on the whole.

Data from 11 canyons that we inventoried systematically were amenable to statistical analysis. Eighty butterfly species (59 residents) have been recorded from the Toquima Range since 1935. By comparison, 99 species have been recorded from the Toiyabe Range. Mean canyon-level butterfly species richness was significantly lower in the Toquima Range than in the Toiyabe Range. This difference cannot be explained by differences in canyon size between the mountain ranges.

Irrigated cropland now comprises 8% of the basin, while dry croplands make up 31%. We used the RHESSys model to compare the changes in plant productivity and vegetation-related hydrological processes that occurred as a result of either land cover alteration or directional temperature changes (-2 degrees C, +4 degrees C). Land cover change exerted more control over annual plant productivity and water fluxes for converted grasslands, while the effect of temperature changes on productivity and water fluxes was stronger in the mountain vegetation. Throughout the basin, land cover change increased the annual loss of water to the atmosphere by 114 mm via evaporation and transpiration, an increase of 37%. Both irrigated and nonirrigated grains became active earlier in the year than shortgrass steppe, leading to a seasonal shift in water losses to the atmosphere. Basin-wide photosynthesis increased by 80% due to grain production. In contrast, a 4 degrees C warming scenario caused annual transpiration to increase by only 3% and annual evaporation to increase by 28%, for a total increase of 71 mm. Warming decreased basin-wide photosynthesis by 16%. There is a large elevational range from east to west in the South Platte Basin, which encompasses the western edge of the Great Plains and the eastern front of the Rocky Mountains. This elevational gain is accompanied by great changes in topographic complexity, vegetation type, and climate. Shortgrass steppe and crops found at elevations between 850 and 1800 m give way to coniferous forests and tundra between 1800 and 4000 m. Climate is increasingly dominated by winter snow precipitation with increasing elevation, and the timing of snowmelt influences tundra and forest ecosystem productivity, soil moisture, and downstream discharge. Mean annual precipitation of <500 mm on the plains below 1800 m is far less than potential evapotranspiration of 1000-1500 mm and is insufficient for optimum plant productivity. The changes in water flux and photosynthesis from conversion of steppe to cropland are the result of redistribution of snowmelt water from the mountains and groundwater pumping through irrigation projects.",1998,10.2307/2640959,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WOS:000077129600010,Shana,No,,No,,South Platte Basin,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Danny,No,,No,S Platte,

However, geomorphic evidence of alpine glacier advance suggests that there were three distinct cooler/wetter periods during the Neoglacial. By careful selection of a sensitive alpine site this study has enabled the recognition of two of these stages in a palynological record of Neoglacial climate. Pollen spectra, conifer needle macrofossils, organic matter content, and magnetic susceptibility were assessed for a continuous sequence of sediment from Blowdown Lake, which has a basal date older than 4000 BP. Comparison of the Picea/Pinus pollen ratios from the core with modern surface samples suggests that treeline was at least 100 m above its present elevation until 3400 BP, indicating that summer temperatures were at least 0.7 degrees C above the present. Treeline declined to near present levels by around 2400 BP. Two subsequent periods of lower treeline were identified which appear to correlate approximately with the Tiedemann and Late Neoglacial periods of glacier advance in southwestern British Columbia. Differences between Picea/Pinus and Abies/Pinus ratios from the core are consistent with the autecology of the species. This suggests that the sensitivity of the pollen ratio approach to reconstructing treeline is dependent on the ratios selected.",1997,,Physical Geography; Paleontology,WOS:A1997WY52000007,Shana,No,,No,,Coast Mtns,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Danny,No,,No,"Coast Mtns, BC",

Combinations of climatic variables that result in unusually fast or slow growth years are also described. Differences in growth-climate relationships among sites, and among individuals from the same site, emphasize within-species variability in response to climate. Growth was not significantly faster or slower on the majority of sites for extreme climate years examined. Few climate variables are correlated with growth of the majority of individuals on most sites, suggesting that some individuals are relatively unresponsive to climate. Individual growth-climate correlations also indicate an increase in the percentage of individuals whose growth is significantly correlated with a climate variable, as the value of the mean site growth correlation increases for that climate variable.

The evidence includes many late-glacial pollen peaks of mountain hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana), an indicator of cool and moist climate, reversals from forest to non-aboreal vegetation, and paleoclimate analysis using pollen-climate transfer functions on the Queen Charlotte Islands. Evidence of cooler ocean waters, based on fossil foraminifera in cores from the continental shelf, also supports an interpretation of a Younger Dryas-age climatic reversal. On the other hand, geological evidence of glacier readvances during the Younger Dryas chronozone is weak and poorly dated. Although more and better-constrained (AMS) dates are needed to confirm the timing of the Pacific Northwest cold oscillation, results so far point to maximum cooling and increased moisture between ca. 10.7-10 ka BP, followed by rapid warming in the early Holocene. Additional late-glacial sites need to be investigated in detail to confirm the geographical pattern of vegetation and climate change during this interval, which is best expressed in hypermaritime and maritime climate regions, similar to the Younger Dryas event around the North Atlantic.

By the late Cretaceous pines had spread east and west throughout Laurasia, attaining high diversity in eastern Asia, the eastern United States, and western Europe, but having little representation at high northern latitudes. Changing climates in the early Tertiary established warm and humid tropical/subtropical conditions in a broad zone to 70-degrees-N throughout middle latitudes. Pines and their relatives disappeared from many middle-latitude areas during this time and were replaced by diverse angiosperm taxa of the boreotropical flora, which were adapted to the equable, tropical climate. The effect of this climate change and spread of boreotropical flora was to displace pines from their former habitats. A hypothesis is defended that pines shifted, during the three warm periods of the Eocene, into three major refugial areas in the Northern Hemisphere: high latitudes, low latitudes, and upland regions of middle latitudes, especially in western North America. Some of these refugial areas (e.g., Mexico/Central America) underwent active volcanism and mountain-building in the Eocene and became secondary centers of pine diversity. Many phylogenetic patterns within Pinus can be traced to this fragmentation, isolation, and evolution in Eocene refugia. Subsections Oocarpae and Sabinianae appear to have originated from refugia in Mexico and Central America. Older subsections such as Sylvestres, Ponderosae, Contortae, and Strobi were distributed over several refugia; subsections Leiophyllae, Australes, and Cembroides evolved in southern refugia in North America; and Canarienses evolved in southern refugia along the Tethys seaway in Eurasia. Following the cooling and drying of the climate at the end of the Eocene, many angiosperm taxa of the boreotropical flora became extinct and pines recolonized middle latitudes, a zone they have occupied to the present. Migration out of refugia provided additional opportunities for hybridization and introgression, as formerly isolated lineages expanded and met.",1993,10.2307/2399795,Plant Sciences,WOS:A1993LC64700014,Shana,Maybe,Maybe,No,,"Entire US

Younger phases correspond with the First Millennium Advance in western Canada, as well as glacier with advances in the Sierra Nevada. The culminating Little Ice Age (LIA) advance was the most recent and extensive of a series of advance/retreat cycles over the past millennium. Retreat from the LIA maximum was the most dramatic episode of ice retreat in at least the last 1000 years. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Prior to 11,500 cal yr BP, cool conditions dominated, fire activity was low, and alpine tundra and Picea parkland grew on the landscape. A step-like climate change to warm summer conditions occurred at 11,500 cal yr BP. In response, fire activity increased facilitating a transition from Picea parkland to closed Pious forest. From 11,500 to 8280 cal yr BP, warm summers and abundant moisture mostly likely from high winter snowfall supported closed Pinus contorta forests. Cooler drier summer conditions prevailed beginning 8280 cal yr BP due to decreased summer insolation and winter snowpack, and lower parkland developed. The timing of vegetation change in the Blacktail Pond record is similar to other low- and middle-elevation sites in the northern Rocky Mountains during the late-glacial period, suggesting local plant communities responded to regional-scale climate change; however, the timing of vegetation changes was spatially variable during the early and middle Holocene due to the varying influences of strengthened summer monsoons and subtropical high on regional precipitation patterns.

Originally thought to have been butchered by humans, it is associated with radiocarbon dates suggesting an age of about 9800 (14)C years B.P. Taphonomic analysis in 2009 indicates the elk likely died of natural causes during winter months; it was lightly scavenged by carnivores prior to burial from silt-rich spring runoff. The elk suffered from two pathological conditions: one resulting in fusion of the fourth and fifth cervical vertebrae, and the other resulting in excessive bone tissue on the proximal ends of the first ribs, seventh cervical, and first and second thoracic vertebrae. The Marmes elk is larger than modern Rocky Mountain elk (C. e. nelsoni) and is on the large end of the size range of modern Roosevelt elk (C. e. roosevelti). It is also larger than the similarly aged elk skeleton from Three Hills, Alberta. A single elk bone from the Sentinel Gap archaeological site in central Washington State, dated to about 10 200 (14)C years BP and located 130 km west of Marmes Rockshelter, is the same size as the same bone of the Marmes elk.

We combined molecular marker data and previously published fossil data to reconstruct the late Quaternary history of a grassland-dependent species, the black-footed ferret (Mustela nigripes), and to determine whether populations from Pleistocene refugia in the Columbia Basin, eastern Beringia, and Great Plains persisted into the Holocene and Recent eras. Using DNA extracted from 97 museum specimens of extirpated populations, we amplified 309 bp of the mtDNA control region, and 8 microsatellite markers from the nuclear genome. Overall haplotype diversity from 309 base pairs (bp) of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region was low (5 haplotypes, nucleotide diversity = 0.001 +/- 0.001 SD) and was contained within a single phylogenetic clade. The star phylogeny and unimodal mismatch distribution indicated that a rapid range expansion from a single Pleistocene refugium occurred. Microsatellite data corroborated this genetic pattern: populations from the mixed grasslands of the Great Plains had significantly higher expected heterozygosity and allelic richness than populations to the west (HE = 0.66 versus 0.41, AR = 4.3 versus 2.7, respectively), and 0, a measure of relative population size, was substantially greater in the east than west (2.4 versus 0.7). We infer from these data that black-footed ferrets rapidly colonized western ecoregions in a stepwise fashion from the Great Plains to the intermountain regions of the Rocky Mountains and the Colorado Plateau after the last ice age.

The paleoenvironmental record reveals four major climatic shifts and a number of less well-defined climatic changes throughout the Holocene. The major climate changes are (1) a cool or cold, late-glacial climate at the end of the last glaciation (>11500 cal. year BP), (2) an interval of drought and maximum summer warmth during the early Holocene (ca. 10500 to 8000 cal. year BP), (3) a mid-Holocene trend towards a cooler, more moist climate (ca. 8000 to ca. 4000 cal. year BP), and (4) a relatively stable climate persisting from ca. 4000 cal. year BP until the arrival of European settlers. Air temperatures have warmed by about 1 degrees C over the past century. Minor climate events that are emerging as global in nature include Little Ice Age (1200-150 BP) conditions, and a late Holocene cool wet period (3500-2500 BP). These are observed in some study sites examined in this paper and may be related to large-scale cycles of 2800-2000 and 1500 years.

Location Specimens were collected from 18 alpine sites in the Rocky Mountains of North America, from southern Colorado to northern Montana. Methods We sequenced 867 and 789 nucleotides of cytochrome oxidase I from an average of 19 and 20 individuals for C. meadii and P. smintheus, respectively, from each of the same 18 localities. From the sequence data, we calculated measures of genetic diversity within each population (H, theta), genetic divergence among populations (F-ST), and tested for geographic structure through an analysis of molecular variance (amova). Population estimates were compared against latitude and between species using a variety of statistical tests. Furthermore, nested clade analysis was implemented to infer historic events underlying the geographic distribution of genetic variation in each species. Then, we compared the number of inferred population events between species using a nonparametric Spearman's rank correlation test. Finally, we ran coalescent simulations on each species' genealogy to test whether the two species of Lepidoptera fit the same model of population divergence. Results Our analyses revealed that: (1) measures of within-population diversity were not correlated with latitude for either species, (2) within-site diversity was not correlated between species, (3) within a species, nearly all populations were genetically isolated, (4) both species exhibited significant and nearly identical partitioning of genetic variation at all hierarchical levels of the amova, including a strong break between populations across the Wyoming Basin, (5) both species experienced similar cycles of expansion and contraction, although fewer were inferred for C. meadii, and (6) data from both species fit a model of three refugia diverging during the Pleistocene. Main conclusions While our findings supported a shared response of the two butterfly species to historic climate change across coarse spatial scales, a common pattern was not evident at finer spatial and temporal scales. The shared demographic history of the two species is consistent with an expanding-contracting archipelago model, suggesting that populations persisted across the geographic range throughout the climate cycles, experiencing isolation on 'sky islands' during interglacial periods and becoming connected as they migrated down-slope during cool, wet climates.",2005,10.1111/j.1365-2699.2005.01356.x,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Physical Geography,WOS:000232493500008,Meghan,Yes,Yes,Yes,Landscape/State-Province,range of butterflies in  alpine rocky mountians,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Danny,Yes,Yes,Paleo,ID MT,

Most notable is a stronger influence of downslope warming over the Cascade Mountains for the daytime events versus a more important role of precipitable water content for the nighttime events, presumably through its impact on downward longwave radiative fluxes. Current research suggests that the frequency and duration of heat waves are expected to increase in much of the United States, and analysis of the heat events reveals that a significant, increasing trend in the frequency of the nighttime events is already occurring in the Pacific Northwest.

We used remotely sensed burn-severity data from 125 fires in the northern Cascade Range of Washington, USA, to explore relationships between fire size, severity, and the spatial pattern of severity. We examined relationships between climate and the annual area burned and the size of wildfires over a 25-year period. We tested the hypothesis that increased fire size is commensurate with increased burn severity and increased spatial aggregation of severely burned areas. We also asked how local ecological controls might modulate these relationships by comparing results over the whole study area (the northern Cascade Range) to those from four ecological subsections within it. We found significant positive relationships between climate and fire size, and between fire size and the proportion of high severity and spatial-pattern metrics that quantify the spatial aggregation of high-severity areas within fires, but the strength and significance of these relationships varied among the four subsections. In areas with more contiguous subalpine forests and less complex topography, the proportion and spatial aggregation of severely burned areas were more strongly correlated with fire size.

Interannual snowpack variability has been attributed to large-scale climate patterns including the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), however, the contribution of snowfall frequency and extreme snowfall events to this variability are less well quantified. Long-term records from Snowpack Telemetry and Cooperative Observer Program stations in the 11 western states were used to investigate these relationships by considering the number of snowfall days and snowfall water equivalent (SFE) of extreme snowfall events. The top decile of snowfall events contributed 20-38% of annual SFE, depending on the region. An average of 65% and 69% of the interannual variability in annual SFE was explained by snowfall days and SFE of top decile snowfall events, respectively, with extreme events being a more significant predictor at most stations. The latitudinal dipole in SFE during ENSO phases results from changes in snowfall frequency and extreme events. In the Pacific Northwest, above normal SFE during La Nina winters was a product of both larger contributions from extremes and more snowfall days, while below normal SFE during El Nino winters was primarily associated with a substantial reduction in extremes. Conversely, annual SFE during ENSO phases in the mountains of Arizona was more closely linked to fluctuations in snowfall days than extremes.

However, there is little information on the frequency of outbreaks of this defoliator for previous centuries. This information is needed to establish baselines defining the historic range of variability of this disturbance, to calculate potential depletions in timber supply from defoliation, and to refine forest management plans. Also, precise estimates of budworm recurrence are needed to assess potential ecosystem changes and possible departures from the historic range of this disturbance due to global warming. We used dendrochronology and time series analysis to determine past frequency of spruce budworm outbreaks in southern BC and found that, since the 1500s, outbreaks have been periodic, with a mean return interval of 28 years (95% Confidence Interval 21-35 years).

Climate and weather conditions influence beetle population dynamics, and managers and policymakers are concerned about the potential effects of climate change on outbreaks. Here we studied five locations with extensive outbreaks in lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) forests across the western United States. Using observations and modeling, we quantified means and changes relative to prior years of three climate or weather factors associated with outbreaks: (1) year-round temperatures that affect adaptive seasonality; (2) low temperatures that induce mortality of overwintering beetles; and (3) drought stress of host trees. Climate variable means varied among locations, indicating the beetle's tolerance to different climate during outbreaks. Analyses of climate or weather factors as outbreaks progressed revealed that year-round temperatures during outbreaks were typically higher than in prior years, and outbreak years lacked very low winter temperatures that often occurred in prior years. Drought was present at each location during some time of an outbreak, and increases in beetle-caused tree mortality at lower beetle population levels (as indicated by killed trees) were usually coincident with drought. Furthermore, drought was not required to maintain large outbreaks; in several locations, relief from drought during periods of high tree mortality did not cause subsequent declines in tree mortality. We did not find strong evidence that maladaptive seasonality, cold-induced mortality, or drought stress was responsible for decreases in tree mortality, suggesting the role of host depletion. Large variability in the relationships between climate or weather variables and outbreaks suggests that different climate and weather factors may have been limiting outbreaks at different times and that these factors did not influence beetle-caused tree mortality similarly among locations. Our results increase understanding of the climate and weather factors that influence beetle outbreaks and their variability in space and time and will lead to more accurate predictions of future patterns of outbreaks that consider future climate.

Considering projected increases in air temperature and changes in precipitation in the coming century, accurate assessment of suitable thermal habitats in freshwater systems is critical for predicting aquatic species' responses to changes in climate and for guiding adaptation strategies. We use a hydrologic model coupled with a stream temperature model and downscaled general circulation model outputs to explore the spatially and temporally varying changes in stream temperature for the late 21st century at the subbasin and ecological province scale for the Columbia River basin (CRB). On average, stream temperatures are projected to increase 3.5 degrees C for the spring, 5.2 degrees C for the summer, 2.7 degrees C for the fall, and 1.6 degrees C for the winter. While results indicate changes in stream temperature are correlated with changes in air temperature, our results also capture the important, and often ignored, influence of hydrological processes on changes in stream temperature. Decreases in future snowcover will result in increased thermal sensitivity within regions that were previously buffered by the cooling effect of flow originating as snowmelt. Other hydrological components, such as precipitation, surface runoff, lateral soil water flow, and groundwater inflow, are negatively correlated to increases in stream temperature depending on the ecological province and season.

Although wildfires are some of the most important ecological processes in forest ecosystems, large-scale wildfires are often perceived as an environmental disaster. Since failure to include the dynamic nature of ecosystems in planning will inevitably lead to unexpected outcomes, we need to enhance our ability to cope with future extreme events coupled with climate change. This study presents several future scenarios in three different time periods for Canada's Columbia Montane Cordillera Ecoprovince, which is prone to wildfires. These scenarios predict the probability of occurrence of widespread wildfires based on the hierarchical Bayesian model. The model was based on the relationships between wildfires and the Monthly Drought Code (MDC). The MDC is a generalized monthly version of the Daily Drought Code widely used across Canada by forest fire management agencies for monitoring of wildfire risk. To calculate future MDC values, we relied on different possible future conditions of climate, given by the Global Circulation Models. We found a regime shift in drought intensity with abrupt decreases in lightning-caused wildfire activity around 1940, suggesting that future wildfire risks can be inferred primarily from the summer drought code. For future periods, we found increasing trends in the probabilities of large-scale fires with time in most areas. It should be notable that, by the 2080s, there is a probability of some areas having more than 50% of large-scale wildfires under the ""average"" climatic conditions in the future, indicating that, even without ""extreme"" weather conditions, some ecosystems will have a fundamental probability of experiencing catastrophic fires under the condition of average summer. However, the rate of progression toward a fire-prone condition is quite different among the three climate change scenarios and among the region analyzed. Given such scenario-sensitive, spatially-heterogeneous patterns of wildfire probability in response to climate variability, management strategy should be flexible and more localized. By drawing on this knowledge, it may be possible to mitigate climate change impacts both before they arise and once they have occurred. These considerations are critical for maintaining the integrity of systems shaped by large-scale natural disturbances to increase their resilience to the changing climate while protecting human society and infrastructures. Working with alternative scenarios will facilitate our adaptation to climate change in managing fire-prone forest ecosystems. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We develop fire prediction models by regressing meteorological variables from the current and previous years together with fire indexes onto observed regional area burned. The regressions explain 0.25-0.60 of the variance in observed annual area burned during 1980-2004, depending on the ecoregion. We also parameterize daily area burned with temperature, precipitation, and relative humidity. This approach explains similar to 0.5 of the variance in observed area burned over forest ecoregions but shows no predictive capability in the semi-arid regions of Nevada and California. By applying the meteorological fields from 15 climate models to our fire prediction models, we quantify the robustness of our wildfire projections at midcentury. We calculate increases of 24-124% in area burned using regressions and 63-169% with the parameterization. Our projections are most robust in the southwestern desert, where all GCMs predict significant (p < 0.05) meteorological changes. For forested ecoregions, more GCMs predict significant increases in future area burned with the parameterization than with the regressions, because the latter approach is sensitive to hydrological variables that show large inter-model variability in the climate projections. The parameterization predicts that the fire season lengthens by 23 days in the warmer and drier climate at midcentury. Using a chemical transport model, we find that wildfire emissions will increase summertime surface organic carbon aerosol over the western United States by 46-70% and black carbon by 20-27% at midcentury, relative to the present day. The pollution is most enhanced during extreme episodes: above the 84th percentile of concentrations, OC increases by similar to 90% and BC by similar to 50%, while visibility decreases from 130 km to 100 km in 32 Federal Class 1 areas in Rocky Mountains Forest.

Here, we introduce a conceptual framework to evaluate to what extent responses of streams to CC will be driven by not only changes in thermal and hydrologic regimes, but also alterations of terrestrial processes. We focused on forested watersheds of western North America because this region is projected to experience CC-induced alteration of terrestrial processes. This provided a backdrop for investigating interactive effects of climate and terrestrial responses on streams. Because stream responses to terrestrial processes have been well-studied in contexts largely independent of CC research, we synthesized this knowledge to demonstrate how CC-induced alterations of terrestrial ecosystems may affect streams. Our synthesis indicated that altered terrestrial processes will change terrestrial-aquatic linkages and autotrophic production, potentially yielding greater sensitivity of streams to CC than would be expected based on shifts in temperature and precipitation regime alone. Despite uncertainties that currently constrain predictions regarding stream responses to these additional pathways of change, this synthesis highlighted broader effects of CC that require additional research. Based on widespread evidence that CC is linked to changing terrestrial processes, we conclude that accurate predictions of CC effects on streams may be coupled to the accuracy of predictions for long-term changes in terrestrial ecosystems.",2013,10.1007/s10021-013-9653-4,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WOS:000321911200015,Adrienne,No,Yes,No,,"Conceptual, not geographic",NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Danny,Yes,Yes,Yes,Salmon river basin,

The American pika (Ochotona princeps) is a small alpine mammal with limited dispersal capacity and low tolerance for thermal stress. As a result, pikas have become an important system for examining biotic responses to changing climatic conditions. Previous research using amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) has revealed evidence for environmental-mediated selection in O. princeps populations distributed along elevation gradients, yet the anonymity of AFLP loci and lack of available genomic resources precluded the identification of associated gene regions. Here, we harnessed next-generation sequencing technology in order to characterize the American pika transcriptome and identify a large suite of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which can be used to elucidate elevation-and site-specific patterns of sequence variation. Results: We constructed pooled cDNA libraries of O. princeps from high (1400m) and low (300m) elevation sites along a previously established transect in British Columbia. Transcriptome sequencing using the Roche 454 GS FLX titanium platform generated 780 million base pairs of data, which were assembled into 7,325 high coverage contigs. These contigs were used to identify 24,261 novel SNP loci. Using high resolution melt analysis, we developed 17 of these SNPs into genotyping assays, which were validated with independent DNA samples from British Columbia Canada and Oregon State USA. In addition, we detected haplotypes in the NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5 of the mitochondrial genome that were fixed and different among elevations, suggesting that this may be an informative target gene for studying the role of cellular respiration in local adaptation. We also identified contigs that were unique to each elevation, including a high elevation-specific contig that was a positive match with the hemoglobin alpha chain from the plateau pika, a species restricted to high elevation steppes in Asia. Elevation-specific contigs may represent candidate regions subject to differential levels of gene expression along this elevation gradient.

To address this uncertainty, we evaluated the differences in model performance and interpretations of a species' thermal niche when using different measures of stream temperature and surrogates for stream temperature. Specifically, we used a logistic regression modeling framework with three different indicators of stream thermal conditions (elevation, air temperature, and stream temperature) referenced to a common set of Brook Trout Salvelinus fontinalis distribution data from the Boise River basin, Idaho. We hypothesized that stream temperature predictions that were contemporaneous with fish distribution data would have stronger predictive performance than composite measures of stream temperature or any surrogates for stream temperature. Across the different indicators of thermal conditions, the highest measure of accuracy was found for the model based on stream temperature predictions that were contemporaneous with fish distribution data (percent correctly classified = 71%). We found considerable differences in inferences across models, with up to 43% disagreement in the amount of stream habitat that was predicted to be suitable. The differences in performance between models support the growing efforts in many areas to develop accurate stream temperature models for investigations of species' thermal niches.

As such, these systems may be especially vulnerable to climate change because of potential shifts in the frequency, magnitude, and timing of flows that can scour incubating embryos. A general framework is presented to examine this issue, using a series of physical models that link climate change, streamflow, and channel morphology to predict the magnitude and spatial distribution of streambed scour and consequent risk to salmonid embryos at basin scales. The approach is demonstrated for a mountain catchment in the Northern Rocky Mountains, USA. Results show that risk of critical scour varies as a function of species and life history and is modulated by local variations in lithology and channel confinement. Embryos of smaller-bodied fall spawners may be at greater risk because of shallow egg burial depths and increased rain-on-snow events during their incubation period. Scour risk for all species is reduced when changes in channel morphology (width, depth, and grain size) keep pace with climate-driven changes in streamflow. Although climate change is predicted to increase scour magnitude, the frequency of scouring events relative to typical salmonid life cycles is relatively low, indicating that individual year classes may be impacted by critical scour, but extirpation of entire populations is not expected. Furthermore, refugia are predicted to occur in unconfined portions of the stream network, where scouring shear stresses are limited to bankfull stage because overbank flows spread across alluvial floodplains; conversely, confined valleys will likely exacerbate climate-driven changes in flow and scour. Our approach can be used to prioritize management strategies according to relative risk to different species or spatial distributions of risk and can be used to predict temporal shifts in the spatial distribution of suitable spawning habitats. A critical unknown issue is whether biological adaptation can keep pace with rates of climate change and channel response.

We developed a hydrologic landscape (HL) classification approach that describes factors of climate-watershed systems that control the hydrologic characteristics of watersheds. Our assessment units are incremental watersheds (i.e., headwater watersheds or areas draining directly into stream reaches). Major components of the classification include indices of annual climate, climate seasonality, aquifer permeability, terrain, and soil permeability. To evaluate the usefulness of our approach, we identified 30 rivers with long-term streamflow-gauging records and without major diversions and impoundments. We used statistical clustering to group the streams based on the shapes of their annual hydrographs. Comparison of the streamflow clusters and HL distributions within river basin clusters shows that the Oregon HL approach has the ability to provide insights about the expected hydrologic behavior of HLs and larger river basins. The Oregon HL approach has potential to be a useful framework for comparing hydrologic attributes of streams and rivers in the Pacific Northwest.",2013,10.1111/jawr.12009,Engineering; Geology; Water Resources,WOS:000314755700012,Becky,No,Yes,No,,"Hydrological Landscape Model, casestudy Oregon",NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Danny,Yes,Yes,Yes,All of OR,

For example, in the Oregon Cascades mountain range, geology, vegetation, and climate influence the hydrologic connections within watersheds. Geology determines which watersheds are surface runoff-dominated and which are groundwater-dominated. In this Mediterranean climate with dry summers, surface runoff watersheds will consistently experience near-zero late summer discharge, so declining snowpacks will have little effect on low flows. This contrasts with groundwater-dominated watersheds, where a shift from snow to rain or a decline in precipitation will reduce recharge, thereby reducing late summer groundwater contributions to streamflow. Earlier snowmelt causes forests to transpire earlier, resulting in decreased springtime streamflow. Reduced snowpacks lead to soil moisture stress, making forests more vulnerable to extensive wildfires and affecting the lifespan and composition of forests. Monitoring and quantifying these complex linkages and feedbacks require appropriate measurement networks. Sampling strategies often use watershed typology to identify where measurements should be focused. Such an approach should include not only established watershed classification parameters such as topology and geology but also interannual climate variability and land cover. As concerns of water scarcity and vulnerability move to the forefront, our watershed classifications should be extended to include ecosystem and social-ecological parameters. An integrated and agent-based modeling scheme called Envision has been developed to simulate alternative future landscapes at the watershed scale. Using fully coupled models of hydrology, ecosystems, and socioeconomics, decision-makers can simulate the effects of policy decisions in conjunction with other climate forcing, land use change, and economic disturbances.

This dependence varies within and between populations due to variation among individuals that is fixed within a life stage (giving rise to what we call persistent variation) and variation from random effects within a life stage (giving rise to what we call random variation). It is important to understand how both types of variation affect phenology if we are to predict the effects of climate change on insect populations. We present three nested phenology models incorporating increasing levels of variation. First, we derive an advection equation to describe the temperature-dependent development of a population with no variation in development time. This model is extended to incorporate persistent variation by introducing a developmental phenotype that varies within a population, yielding a phenotype-dependent advection equation. This is further extended by including a diffusion term describing random variation in a phenotype-dependent Fokker-Planck development equation. These models are also novel because they are formulated in terms of development time rather than developmental rate; development time can be measured directly in the laboratory, whereas developmental rate is calculated by transforming laboratory data. We fit the phenology models to development time data for mountain pine beetles (MPB) (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins [Coleoptera: Scolytidae]) held at constant temperatures in laboratory experiments. The nested models are parameterized using a maximum likelihood approach. The results of the parameterization show that the phenotype-dependent advection model provides the best fit to laboratory data, suggesting that MPB phenology may be adequately described in terms of persistent variation alone. MPB phenology is simulated using phloem temperatures and attack time distributions measured in central Idaho. The resulting emergence time distributions compare favorably to field observations.",2010,10.1007/s11538-009-9494-7,Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Mathematical & Computational Biology,WOS:000280595200002,Courtney,Yes,Yes,Yes,Landscape/State-Province,"Central Idaho, pine beetles",NA,,,,,,Micah,Yes,Yes,Yes,ID,Danny,Yes,Yes,Yes,ID,

Effectively conserving biodiversity in these systems requires accurate downscaling of climatic trends to local habitat conditions, but downscaling is difficult in complex terrains given diverse microclimates and mediation of stream heat budgets by local conditions. We compiled a stream temperature database (n = 780) for a 2500-km river network in central Idaho to assess possible trends in summer temperatures and thermal habitat for two native salmonid species from 1993 to 2006. New spatial statistical models that account for network topology were parameterized with these data and explained 93% and 86% of the variation in mean stream temperatures and maximas, respectively. During our study period, basin average mean stream temperatures increased by 0.38 degrees C (0.27 degrees C/decade), and maximas increased by 0.48 degrees C (0.34 degrees C/decade), primarily due to long-term (30-50 year) trends in air temperatures and stream flows. Radiation increases from wildfires accounted for 9% of basin-scale temperature increases, despite burning 14% of the basin. Within wildfire perimeters, however, stream temperature increases were 2-3 times greater than basin averages, and radiation gains accounted for 50% of warming. Thermal habitat for rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) was minimally affected by temperature increases, except for small shifts towards higher elevations. Bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus), in contrast, were estimated to have lost 11-20% (8-16%/decade) of the headwater stream lengths that were cold enough for spawning and early juvenile rearing, with the largest losses occurring in the coldest habitats. Our results suggest that a warming climate has begun to affect thermal conditions in streams and that impacts to biota will be specific to both species and context. Where species are at risk, conservation actions should be guided based on considerations of restoration opportunity and future climatic effects. To refine predictions based on thermal effects, more work is needed to understand mechanisms associated with biological responses, climate effects on other habitat features, and habitat configurations that confer population resilience.",2010,10.1890/09-0822.1,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WOS:000279047400012,Courtney,Yes,Yes,Yes,Landscape/State-Province,"Boise Basin, Stream Temp, bull trout",NA,,,,,,Becky,Yes,Yes,Yes,Regional PNW (ID etc),Danny,Yes,Yes,Yes,ID,

The most important factor affecting climate change presumably was a change in the mode of operation of the sun one or two decades earlier (from irregular periodicity and low output to regular periods and greater brightness). But the direct cause appears to have been the onset of drought in the 1830s. Interestingly, there is no obvious solar information in the drought narrative in Montana and southwestern Canada. The presence of tidal lines in the spectrum of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, together with the presence of lines that could be interpreted as beat periods between solar and tidal forcing in the drought series, suggests that the energy of solar variation is preempted for interference with tidal forcing, within the system of oscillations informing precipitation patterns in the region. The suggestion is supported by the presence of a strikingly dominant 12.5-year period in the drought series, which is interpreted as a difference tone between the main sunspot cycle (at 10.8) and a tidal period at 5.8. Also, this period is close to 2/3 of the nodal tide (at 18.61). (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

In the context of managed flood control, these systematic changes are likely to disrupt the balance between flood control and reservoir refill in existing reservoir systems. To adapt to these hydrologic changes, refill timing and evacuation requirements for flood control need to be modified. This work poses a significant systems engineering problem, especially for large, multiobjective water systems. An existing optimization/simulation procedure is refined for rebalancing flood control and refill objectives for the Columbia River Basin for anticipated global warming. To calibrate the optimization model for the 20th century flow, the objective function is tuned to reproduce the current reliability of reservoir refill, while providing comparable levels of flood control to those produced by current flood control practices. After the optimization model is calibrated using the 20th century flow the same objective function is used to develop flood control curves for a global warming scenario which assumes an approximately 2 C increase in air temperature.

During outbreaks, the resulting widespread tree mortality reduces forest carbon uptake and increases future emissions from the decay of killed trees. The impacts of insects on forest carbon dynamics, however, are generally ignored in large- scale modelling analyses. The current outbreak in British Columbia, Canada, is an order of magnitude larger in area and severity than all previous recorded outbreaks(4). Here we estimate that the cumulative impact of the beetle outbreak in the affected region during 2000 - 2020 will be 270 megatonnes ( Mt) carbon ( or 36 g carbon m(-2) yr(-1) on average over 374,000 km 2 of forest). This impact converted the forest from a small net carbon sink to a large net carbon source both during and immediately after the outbreak. In the worst year, the impacts resulting from the beetle outbreak in British Columbia were equivalent to similar to 75% of the average annual direct forest fire emissions from all of Canada during 1959 - 1999. The resulting reduction in net primary production was of similar magnitude to increases observed during the 1980s and 1990s as a result of global change(5).

However, predictions of future changes in snow hydrology and water supply from mountain basins are complicated by natural variability in climate and interactions among topography, vegetation structure, wind and radiation energy, and snow deposition. In this study, interannual variability in snow-cover development, snow melt, and runoff is assessed for a range of precipitation and temperature conditions typical of a mountain catchment, the Reynolds Mountain East (RME) basin, in Idaho. A spatially distributed energy and mass balance snow model, Isnobal, coupled with a windfield and snow redistribution model, is used to continuously simulate snow accumulation and melt for five individual snow seasons (1984, 1986, 1987, 2001, and 2006), representing the historic range of climatic variance. The modeling results compare well with the field measurements of snow water equivalent for all simulation snow seasons (Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient of 0.81 to 0.97). The modeling scheme used in this study demonstrates spatial and temporal differences in snow-cover development and melt processes in complex mountain terrain. During all simulation snow seasons, the forested site was shown to hold more snow, generate more snowmelt, and melt later than the exposed site of the basin. Comparison of simulation results for wet and dry snow seasons showed that the snow melts earlier and a greater fraction of surface water input (SWI) is utilized to fill soil water storage during dry seasons than in wet snow seasons. This study demonstrates differences in snowmelt volume and timing during wet and dry seasons within a mountain basin. It will improve understanding of how interannual variability affects the delivery of water from the seasonal snowcover to the soil and streams of mountain basins, and can provide useful inputs to the decision-making process for reservoir and water management strategies for utilizing surplus or supplementing deficit water supplies during wet and dry years, respectively.

The importance of winter snow accumulation to upland ecosystems is not as clearly defined. This study investigates the relative contribution of winter precipitation to upland spring and summer soil moisture storage and availability in a semi-arid mountainous watershed. At this site, coarse soil textures and shallow soil depths limit soil storage capacity to 616?cm. Winter precipitation exceeds soil storage capacity by 2.5 times. Accordingly, soil moisture profiles at most locations in the watershed reach field capacity in early winter. With soil storage near capacity, water released by snowmelt primarily contributes to deep drainage and makes a limited contribution to the soil moisture reservoir. Water that is retained by the soil after the snowpack melts is lost to evapotranspiration in as little as 10?days. In contrast, spring precipitation extends moist soil conditions by up to 90?days into the warm season, when ecological water demand is highest. These field observations suggest that changes in spring precipitation, not winter snowpack, may have the greater impact on upland ecosystems in this environment. Furthermore, because winter precipitation is in excess compared to the soil storage capacity, soil moisture availability may be fairly insensitive to climate change-induced transitions from snow to rain.

We employ the entire model chain from global and regional climate models, station-based statistical downscaling, and a fully distributed, physically based hydrologic model and verify the results against observed streamflow. The performance is model dependent but is generally encouraging enough to justify the application of the climate scenarios. A general warming of about 2 degrees C is projected and, on average, slightly drier conditions, especially in late summer. We find evidence that the projected changes are elevation dependent and relatively small scale, with decreasing signals with higher elevations. All models project a shift of the hydrograph toward a more rain-fed regime, with peak flows occurring in June instead of July. Annual peak flow is projected to not increase, and August low flow decreases in all four models. With nonshrinking (static) glaciers, relatively high melting rates are simulated for August and September that partly compensate for the shifted hydrograph; this enhanced glacier melt is also detected in simulated historic Columbia headwater flow. The static approximation is supported by a heuristic seasonal sensitivity analysis that suggests a moderate average areal glacier recession of about 10% for the midcentury.

The output from seven selected watershed models from the mountainous western United States and one model from coastal Maine in the northeastern United States shows a future of declining spring snowpack. Snow-cover area (SCA) and snow-water equivalent (SWE) were used to compare the spring snowpack for current conditions (2006) with three time periods in the future (2030, 2060, and 2090) using three Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) emission scenarios published in the 2007 Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES): A2, B1, and A1B.

Location High-elevation forests in south-west Montana, central Idaho, eastern and western Oregon, USA. Methods Stand inventory and dendroecological methods were used to assess stand structure and composition and to reconstruct forest history at sixty 0.1-ha plots. Patterns of blister rust infection and mountain pine beetle-caused mortality in whitebark pine trees were examined using nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA, Mann-Whitney U-tests, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov two-sample tests. Stepwise regression was used to build models of blister rust infection and mountain pine beetle-related mortality rates based on a suite of biophysical site variables. Results Occurrence of blister rust infections was significantly different among the mountain ranges, with a general gradient of decreasing blister rust occurrence from east to west. Evidence of mountain pine beetle-caused mortality was identified on 83% of all dead whitebark pine trees and was relatively homogenous across the study area. Blister rust infected trees of all ages and sizes uniformly, while mountain pine beetles infested older, larger trees at all sites. Stepwise regressions explained 64% and 58% of the variance in blister rust infection and beetle-caused mortality, respectively, indicating that these processes are strongly influenced by the biophysical environment. More open stand structures produced by beetle outbreaks may increase the exposure of surviving whitebark pine trees to blister rust infection. Main conclusions Variability in the patterns of blister rust infection and mountain pine beetle-caused mortality elucidated the fundamental dynamics of these disturbance agents and suggests that the effects of climate change will be complex in whitebark pine communities and vary across the species' range.

Bull trout Salvelinus confluentus may be especially vulnerable to climate change given that spawning and early rearing are constrained by cold water temperatures creating a patchwork of natal headwater habitats across river networks. Because the size and connectivity of patches also appear to influence the persistence of local populations, climate warming could lead to increasing fragmentation of remaining habitats and accelerated decline of this species. We modeled the relationships between (1) the lower elevation limits of small bull trout and mean annual air temperature and (2) latitude and longitude across the species' potential range within the interior Columbia River basin of the USA. We used our results to explore the implications of the climate warming expected in the next 50 or more years. We found a strong association between the lower elevation limits of bull trout distributions and longitude and latitude; this association was consistent with the patterns in mean annual air temperature. We concluded that climate does strongly influence regional and local bull trout distributions, and we estimated bull trout habitat response to a range of predicted climate warming effects. Warming over the range predicted could result in losses of 18-92% of thermally suitable natal habitat area and 27-99% of large (>10,000-ha) habitat patches, which suggests that population impacts may be disproportionate to the simple loss of habitat area. The predicted changes were not uniform across the species' range, and some populations appear to face higher risks than others.

We examined two case studies: Cle Elum River, Washington, and Chattahoochee-Apalachicola River Basin, Georgia and Florida. These rivers had available downscaled global circulation model (GCM) data and allowed us to analyse the effects of future climate scenarios on rivers with (1) different hydrographs, (2) high future water demands, and (3) a river-floodplain system. We compared observed flow regimes to those predicted under future climate scenarios to describe the extent and type of changes predicted to occur. Daily stream flow under future climate scenarios was created by either statistically downscaling GCMs (Cle Elum) or creating a regression model between climatological parameters predicted from GCMs and stream flow (Chattahoochee-Apalachicola). Flow regimes were examined for changes from current conditions with respect to ecologically relevant features including the magnitude and timing of minimum and maximum flows. The Cie Elum's hydrograph under future climate scenarios showed a dramatic shift in the timing of peak flows and lower low flow of a longer duration. These changes could mean higher summer water temperatures, lower summer dissolved oxygen, and reduced survival of larval fishes. The Chattahoochee-Apalachicola basin is heavily impacted by dams and water withdrawals for human consumption; therefore, we made comparisons between pre-large dam conditions, current conditions, current conditions with future demand, and future climate scenarios with future demand to separate climate change effects and other anthropogenic impacts. Dam construction, future climate, and future demand decreased the flow variability of the river. In addition, minimum flows were lower under future climate scenarios. These changes could decrease the connectivity of the channel and the floodplain, decrease habitat availability, and potentially lower the ability of the river to assimilate wastewater treatment plant effluent. Our study illustrates the types of changes that river ecosystems might experience under future climates.

These fires are usually attributed to increased stand density as a result of fire suppression, grazing and other land use, and are often considered uncharacteristic or unprecedented(1-3). Tree-ring records from the past 500 years indicate that before Euro-American settlement, frequent, low-severity fires maintained open stands(1-3). However, the pre-settlement period between about AD 1500 and AD 1900 was also generally colder than present(5-10), raising the possibility that rapid twentieth-century warming promoted recent catastrophic fires. Here we date fire-related sediment deposits in alluvial fans in central Idaho to reconstruct Holocene fire history in xeric ponderosa pine forests and examine links to climate. We find that colder periods experienced frequent low-severity fires, probably fuelled by increased understory growth. Warmer periods experienced severe droughts, stand-replacing fires and large debris-flow events that comprise a large component of long-term erosion(11) and coincide with similar events in sub-alpine forests of Yellowstone National Park(12).

That is particularly true for stream fishes and cold-water species like trout, salmon, and char that are already constrained to high elevations and latitudes. The extreme climates in those environments also preclude invasions by most non-native species, so identifying especially cold habitats capable of absorbing future climate change while still supporting native populations would highlight important refugia. By coupling crowd-sourced biological datasets with high-resolution stream temperature scenarios, we delineate network refugia across >250000 stream km in the Northern Rocky Mountains for two native salmonidsbull trout (BT) and cutthroat trout (CT). Under both moderate and extreme climate change scenarios, refugia with high probabilities of trout population occupancy (>0.9) were predicted to exist (33-68 BT refugia; 917-1425 CT refugia). Most refugia are on public lands (>90%) where few currently have protected status in National Parks or Wilderness Areas (<15%). Forecasts of refuge locations could enable protection of key watersheds and provide a foundation for climate smart planning of conservation networks. Using cold water as a climate shield' is generalizable to other species and geographic areas because it has a strong physiological basis, relies on nationally available geospatial data, and mines existing biological datasets.

Insect epidemics, wildfires, and timber harvest have greatly affected North American C budgets in the last century. Research is needed to understand how forest C dynamics (source duration and recovery time) following disturbance vary as a function of disturbance type, severity, forest type, and initial C stocks. We used the Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS) to simulate total C stocks (excluding soil) for 100 years following three types of disturbance (fire, harvest, and insects) with four levels of severity. We initiated the model using empirical data from a large representative sample of forest conditions on the national forest ownership in the Rocky Mountain region (Forest Inventory and Analysis data). Unlike analyses based on stand age, an ambiguous quantity with respect to disturbance history, our approach enables explicit consideration of disturbance type and severity, as well as pre-disturbance forest C. On average, stands became a C sink after fire in 5, 6, 14, and 23 years for low to high-severity fire. Pre-fire C stocks were reached 25-55 years later. Following bark beetle epidemics, on average stands continued to be a C source for 10 years longer than fire and up to 40 years longer in some cases, but pre-disturbance C stocks were reached in a similar amount of time. C stocks following harvest showed the largest initial decline, but on average stands became a sink sooner at 1, 5, 15, and 12 years post-harvest for low to high-severity harvests. Differences in C dynamics based on disturbance type and severity, initial conditions, and forest type demonstrate the importance of considering this variability when modeling forest C dynamics. The regionally averaged models of C response quantified in this study can be combined with remotely sensed data on disturbance type and severity and used with C accounting approaches that rely on growth and yield or state and transition models.

Previous studies have shown that pikas have high metabolism and low thermal conductance, which allow survival during cold winters. It has been hypothesized that these characteristics may be detrimental, given the recent warming trends observed in montane ecosystems. We examined resting metabolic rate, surface activity, and den and ambient temperatures (T-a) of pikas in late summer (August 2011 and 2012) at 2 locations in the Rocky Mountains. Resting metabolic rate was calculated to be 2.02 mL O-2 . g(-1)h(-1), with a lower critical temperature (LCT) of 28.1 +/- 0.2 degrees C. No upper critical temperature (UCT) could be determined from our data; therefore, the estimated thermoneutral zone (TNZ) was 28.1 degrees C to at least 35.0 degrees C (upper experimental temperature). Pikas in this study showed the same bimodal above-talus activity patterns reported in previous studies. Den temperatures in Colorado were correlated with, but consistently lower than, current ambient temperatures. Wyoming den temperatures showed a weak correlation with T-a 20 min prior to the current den temperature. This study is one of few to present data on the physiological response pikas may have to current warming conditions, and the first to perform metabolic measurements in situ. Our data support conclusions of previous studies, specifically MacArthur and Wang (1973, 1974) and Smith (1974), which indicated American pikas may not have the physiological ability to cope with high T-a.

All events involved snowpack outflow, but only seven events had continuous net snowpack outflow, including three of the five top-ranked peak discharge events. Peak discharge was not related to precipitation rate, but it was related to the 10 day sum of precipitation and net snowpack outflow, indicating an increased flood response to continuously melting snowpacks. The two largest peak discharge events in the study had significant wavelet coherence at multiple time scales over several days; a distribution of phase differences between precipitation and net snowpack outflow at the 12-32 h time scale with a sharp peak at /2 radians; and strongly correlated snowpack outflow among lysimeters representing 42% of basin area.

Many valley glaciers formerly linked as distributary glaciers to high-level icecaps have decoupled at their icefalls, exposing major escarpments and generating a suite of dynamic landforrns dominated by mass wasting. Ice-dominated landforms, here termed icy debris fans, develop rapidly by ice avalanching, rockfall, and icy debris flow. Field-based reconnaissance studies at two alpine settings, the Wrangell Mountains of Alaska and the Southern Alps of New Zealand, provide a preliminary morphogenetic model of spatial and temporal evolution of icy debris fans in a range of alpine settings. The influence of these processes on landform evolution is largely unrecognized in the literature dealing with post-glacial landform adjustment known as the paraglacial. A better understanding of these dynamic processes will be increasingly important because of the extreme geohazards characterizing these areas. Our field studies show that after glacier decoupling, icy debris fans begin to form along the base of bedrock escarpments at the mouths of catchments and prograde over valley glaciers. The presence of a distinct catchment, apex, and fan morphology distinguishes these landforms from other landforms common in periglacial hillslope settings receiving abundant clastic debris and ice. Ice avalanching is the most abundant process involved in icy debris fan formation. Fans developed below weakly incised catchments are dominated by ice avalanching and are composed primarily of ice with minor lithic detritus. Typically, avalanches fall into the fan catchments where sediments transform into grainflows that flow onto the fans. Once on the fans, avalanche deposits ablate rapidly, flattening and concentrating lithic fragments at the surface. Icy debris fans may become thick enough to become glaciers with splay crevasse systems. Fans developed below larger, more complex catchments are composed of higher proportions of lithic detritus resulting from temporary storage of ice and lithic detritus deposits within the catchment. Episodic outbursts of meltwater from the icecap may mix with the stored sediments and mobilize icy debris flows (mixture of ice and lithic clasts) onto the fans. Our observations indicate that the entire evolutionary cycle of icy debris fans probably occurs during an early paraglacial interval (i.e., decades to 100 years). Observations comparing avalanche frequency, volume, and fan morphologic evolution at the Alaska site between 2006 and 2010 illustrate complex response between icy debris fans even within the same cirque - where one fan may be growing while others are downwasting because of differences in ice supply controlled by their respective catchments and icecap contributions. As ice supply from the icecap diminishes through time, icy debris fans rapidly downwaste and eventually evolve into talus cones that receive occasional but ephemeral ice avalanches.",2012,10.1016/j.geomorph.2012.01.014,Physical Geography; Geology,WOS:000302427200006,Becky,No,Yes,No,,"AK, NZ (glaciers in general and CC)",NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Meghan,No,,International,"AK, NZ (glaciers in general and CC)",

AD 1740-1790) did not show significant correlations between the chironomid record and any of the eight other records considered here, probably because of increased precipitation and changes in the sediment composition which influenced the chironomid assemblages. 75% of the periods considered had significant correlations between the chironomid records, and both the reconstruction based on quartz/mica ratios and the inferred JJAS early instrumental and documentary proxy evidence, while 60% of the periods showed significant correlations between the chironomid-based record and the reconstruction based on early instrumental data of Central Europe. These results suggest that chironomids in the sediment of wake Silvaplana yield valid temperature reconstructions at regional scales for the last 420 years.",2009,10.1177/0959683609348253,Physical Geography; Geology,WOS:000271911200008,Courtney,No,,No,,Swiss Alps,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Meghan,No,,International,Swiss Alps,

We used topographical variables and downscaled climate warming simulations to build a high-resolution spatial database (10 m) according to four different climate warming scenarios for the twenty-first century. The spatial changes in the suitable habitat were simulated using a species distribution model, in order to analyze altitudinal shifts and potential habitat loss of the key species. Thus, the advance and receding fronts of known occurrence locations were computed by introducing a new concept named differential suitability, and potential patterns of substitution among the key species were established. The average mean temperature trend show an increase of 4.8A degrees C, which will induce the vertical shift of the suitable habitat for all the five key species considered at an average rate of 11.57 m/year. According to the simulations, the suitable habitat for the key species inhabiting the summit area, where most of the endemic and/or rare species are located, may disappear before the middle of the century. The other key species considered show moderate to drastic suitable habitat loss depending on the considered scenario. Climate warming should provoke a strong substitution dynamics between species, increasing spatial competition between both of them. In this study, we introduce the application of differential suitability concept into the analysis of potential impact of climate change, forest management and environmental monitoring, and discuss the limitations and uncertainties of these simulations.",2011,10.1007/s10584-010-0015-3,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,WOS:000295033800005,Danny,No,Yes,No,Ecosystem/Municipal,SE Iberian Pennisula,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Meghan,No,,International,SE Iberian Pennisula,

During drought plants respond physiologically and structurally to prevent excessive water loss according to species-specific water use strategies. This has consequences for carbon uptake by photosynthesis and release by total ecosystem respiration. After a drought the disturbances in the reservoirs of moisture, organic matter and nutrients in the soil and carbohydrates in plants lead to longer-term effects in plant carbon cycling, and potentially mortality. Direct and carry-over effects, mortality and consequently species competition in response to drought are strongly related to the survival strategies of species. Here we review the state of the art of the understanding of the relation between soil moisture drought and the interactions with the carbon cycle of the terrestrial ecosystems. We argue that plant strategies must be given an adequate role in global vegetation models if the effects of drought on the carbon cycle are to be described in a way that justifies the interacting processes.

Br content appears to be broadly correlative with mean annual temperature variations because of changes in catchment vegetation productivity. Sr/Rb ratio reflects the proportion of the unweathered terrestrial fraction. XRD appears to reflect water yield regime and sediment flux. Sedimentation is rather continuous because annual elastic supply and deposited mass are the same. The artificial neural networks method was applied to convert annual sedimentary time-series of XRD, Br content, and Sr/Rb ratio to annual records of temperature and precipitation using a transfer function. Comparison of these reconstructed Siberian records with the annual record of air temperature for the Northern Hemisphere shows similar trends in climatic variability over the past 800 yr.

Local flora and fauna should be adapted to typhoons, however more severe storms in the past decade most likely due to climate change have caused an apparent impact on local ecosystems and diversity. Heavy rainfall from typhoon events has been associated with declines in density and biodiversity of low altitude freshwater fish. Montane streams on the other hand are assumed to be more resilient to typhoons as these habitats receive less washed-off pollutant and is buffeted by established vegetation. However, as access to isolated montane streams, especially after a typhoon, is difficult, the effects of typhoons on these habitats are rarely studied. In this study, we overcame many obstacles to survey montane freshwater fishes in Beikeng Creek shortly after a typhoon event. We demonstrated extreme changes in physical characteristics, but little changes in chemical characteristics of the stream. We also documented the absence of the endemic Rhinogobius rubromaculatus (red spotted goby) and the crashed population of Onychostoma barbatulum, (Taiwan shovel-jaw carp) after typhoon. Although these two endemic species are expected to survive in other unaffected montane creeks and streams in the vicinity, the dramatic decline in montane fish population in Beikeng Creek suggests that conservation management may need to be reconsidered to prevent possible extinction under increasing human and natural perturbations.",2015,10.1007/s10641-014-0243-x,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,WOS:000345625400004,Micah,No,Yes,No,,Taiwan,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Meghan,No,,International,Taiwan,

We evaluated the performance of planted seedlings of two oak species at two sites in a Mediterranean mountain (Sierra Nevada, SE Spain): one located within the current altitudinal forest range (1,600-1,760 m), and one above the upper forest limit (1,970-2,120 m). The forest service planted 1,350 seedlings of the deciduous Pyrenean oak and the evergreen Holm oak in a postfire successional shrubland. After 2 years, seedlings were monitored for survival, and a subset of 110 Pyrenean oaks and 185 Holm oaks were harvested for analyses of biomass and foliar nutrient status, C-13, and O-18. Both species showed the highest survival and leaf N status above the upper forest limit, and survival increased with altitude within each plot. The deciduous oak benefited most from planting at higher altitude, and it also had greater biomass at the higher site. Correlations between foliar N, O-18, and C-13 across elevations indicate tighter stomatal control of water loss and greater water-use efficiency with increasing plant N status at higher altitude, which may represent a so-far overlooked positive feedback mechanism that could foster uphill range shifts in water-limited mountain regions. Given ongoing trends and future projections of increasing temperature and aridity throughout the Mediterranean region, tree-species selection for forest restoration should target forecasted climatic conditions rather than those prevailing in the past.

Here, we present an extensive molecular phylogeny of the viperid snake genus Montivipera, including all known taxa. Based on nuclear and mitochondrial data, we present novel insights into the phylogeny of the genus and review the status of its constituent species. Maximum likelihood methods revealed a montane origin of Montivipera at 12.3 Mya. We then analyzed factors of mountain viper diversity. Our data support substantial changes in effective population size through Plio-Pleistocene periods. We conclude that climatic oscillations were drivers of allopatric speciation, and that mountain systems of the Near and Middle East have strongly influenced the evolution and survival of taxa, because climatic and topographical heterogeneities induced by mountains have played a crucial role as filters for dispersal and as multiple refugia. The wide diversity of montane microhabitats enabled mountain vipers to retain their ecological niche during climatic pessima. In consequence the varied geological and topographical conditions between refugia favoured genetic isolation and created patterns of species richness resulting in the formation of neoendemic taxa. Our data support high concordance between geographic distributions of Montivipera haplotypes with putative plant refugia.

Here we combine population genetics with species distribution modelling to assess patterns and causes of extinction or persistence in two cold-adapted species, Salty hastata and Juncus balticus, which survived post-glacial retractions in calcareous fens of the Iberian Peninsula. In both species, we detected extremely-low genetic diversity and clonal strategies in red-listed populations of the most Marginal region (Cantabrian Range), but high genetic diversity linked with sexual reproduction in populations from a less marginal region of the rear edge (Pyrenees). Genetic patterns were partially explained by past and present species climatic niches, more remarkably in the arctic-alpine S. hastata than in the boreo-atlantic J. balticus, suggesting different biogeographic history but similar sensitivity to global change. Our results show different magnitudes of extinction debt in regional populations that have survived in mountain refugia since the Last Glacial Maximum. Functional extinction of the most marginal populations can be explained by postglacial climate change and the historical decline of mire habitats. In contrast with the current trend of predicting future effects of climate change, we highlight that glacial relict populations might be currently going into extinction in climatically marginal regions. These populations can provide valuable information about the processes involved in species extinctions, improving our capacity to anticipate the effect of global change across regions and habitats.

Climatic change is a global factor that has been implicated in some of these declines. In this paper, we speculate on how Neotropical anurans might respond to changes in climate predicted by Hulme and Viner (1998). We focus on two distinct groups of Neotropical anurans: frogs that live and oviposit in leaf litter and frogs that congregate at ponds to breed. Increased temperature, increased length of dry season, decreased soil moisture, and increased inter-annual rainfall variability will affect Neotropical frogs strongly. We expect that these changes will directly affect frogs by changing reproductive success and breeding periodicity, and indirectly by altering the invertebrate prey base. The individual effects will likely translate into changes at the population and community levels. We also speculate on how climatic change will affect Neotropical amphibians that are restricted ecologically and/or geographically.

Furthermore, it is unclear to what degree other forcings, including atmospheric deposition of anthropogenic reactive nitrogen (Nr), have participated in recent regime shifts. Diatom-based paleolimnological syntheses offer an effective tool for retrospective assessments of past and ongoing changes in remote lake ecosystems. Methodology/Principal Findings: We synthesized 52 dated sediment diatom records from lakes in western North America and west Greenland, spanning broad latitudinal and altitudinal gradients, and representing alpine (n = 15), arctic (n = 20), and forested boreal-montane (n = 17) ecosystems. Diatom compositional turnover (beta-diversity) during the 20(th) century was estimated using Detrended Canonical Correspondence Analysis (DCCA) for each site and compared, for cores with sufficiently robust chronologies, to both the 19(th) century and the prior similar to 250 years (Little Ice Age). For both arctic and alpine lakes, beta-diversity during the 20(th) century is significantly greater than the previous 350 years, and increases with both latitude and altitude. Because no correlation is apparent between 20(th)-century diatom beta-diversity and any single physical or limnological parameter (including lake and catchment area, maximum depth, pH, conductivity, [NO3-], modeled Nr deposition, ambient summer and winter air temperatures, and modeled temperature trends 1948-2008), we used Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to summarize the amplitude of recent changes in relationship to lake pH, lake: catchment area ratio, modeled Nr deposition, and recent temperature trends. Conclusions/Significance: The ecological responses of remote lakes to post-industrial environmental changes are complex. However, two regions reveal concentrations of sites with elevated 20(th)-century diatom beta-diversity: the Arctic where temperatures are increasing most rapidly, and mid-latitude alpine lakes impacted by high Nr deposition rates. We predict that remote lakes will continue to shift towards new ecological states in the Anthropocene, particularly in regions where these two forcings begin to intersect geographically.",2010,10.1371/journal.pone.0010026,Science & Technology - Other Topics,WOS:000276419900020,Courtney,No,Maybe,No,Biome/National,,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Meghan,Maybe,Yes,Maybe,most likely site 39 or nearby is in,

This retreat has been accompanied by statistically detectable declines in late-summer streamflow from glacier-fed catchments over much of the Study area, although there is some geographical variation: over recent decades, glaciers in northwest BC and southwest Yukon have lost mass dominantly by thinning with relatively low rates of terminal retreat, and glacier-fed streams in that region have experienced increasing flows. In many valleys, glacier retreat has produced geomorphic hazards, including outburst floods from moraine-dammed lakes, mass failures from oversteepened valley walls and debris flows generated on moraines. In addition to these hydrologic and geomorphic changes, evidence is presented that glacier retreat will result in higher stream temperatures, possibly transient increases in suspended sediment fluxes and concentrations, and changes in water chemistry. With climate projected to continue warming over the twenty-first century, current trends in hydrology, geomorphology and water quality should continue, with a range of implications for water resources availability and management and hydroecology, particularly for cool and cold-water species such as salmonids.

For the same area, timeframe, land cover characteristics and soil properties, groundwater recharge was estimate using (i) single-station climate data with monthly PET calculated by the Thornthwaite method; (ii) single-station climate data with daily PET calculated by the Penman-Monteith method; and (iii) daily gridded climate data with spatially distributed PET calculated using the Penman-Monteith method. For each treatment, the magnitude and distribution of actual evapotranspiration (AET) for summer months compared well with those estimated for a 5-year crop study, suggesting that the near-surface hydrological processes were replicated and that subsequent groundwater recharge rates are realistic. However, for winter months, calculated AET was near zero when using the Thornthwaite PET method. Mean annual groundwater recharge varied from similar to 3.2 to 10.0 mm when PET was calculated by the Thornthwaite method, and from similar to 1.8 to 7.5 mm when PET was calculated by the Penman-Monteith method. Comparisons of bivariate plots of seasonal recharge rates estimated from single-station versus gridded surface climate reveal that there is greater variability between the different methods for spring months, which is the season of greatest recharge. Furthermore, these seasonal differences are shown to provide different results when compared to the depth to water table, which could lead to different results of evaporative extinction depth. These findings illustrate potential consequences of using different approaches for representing spatial meteorological input data, which could provide conflicting predictions when modelling the influence of climate change on groundwater recharge.

This study was conducted in the sagebrush-steppe ecosystem co-dominated by mountain big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata var. vaseyana) and perennial grasses in south-central Wyoming across two growing seasons (2004 and 2005). A dry spring in 2004 and a wet spring in 2005 provided an opportunity to evaluate the influence of precipitation timing on the magnitudes and patterns of net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) and its environmental drivers. Summer weather conditions (light, temperature, and vapor pressure deficit) for the 2 years were similar but deep soil moisture content was lower in 2004. Daily rates of NEE demonstrated a net carbon source in 2004 and a net carbon sink in 2005. Midday depression of NEE frequently occurred in both measurement years (June-August in 2004 and mid July-August in 2005) due to stomatal control restricting water loss from the system under low soil moisture and high temperature and vapor pressure deficit conditions. Across different soil moisture regimes, the controlling factors on NEE differed. Under water limitation, soil water availability (soil drought) was the main driving factor of growing season NEE regardless of weather conditions while vapor pressure deficit (atmospheric drought) was the main driver of NEE when the ecosystem was not limited by soil moisture. Nighttime NEE showed strong non-linear relationship with soil moisture but no relationship with soil temperature, demonstrating that respiratory processes in the sagebrush-steppe ecosystem were limited by soil moisture during summer. The dynamic response of NEE to two summer seasons with dissimilar spring precipitation indicates that intra-seasonal variability in precipitation and subsequent impact on deep soil moisture should be taken into consideration to explain magnitudes and patterns of NEE at diurnal to seasonal time scales.

The accuracy of the SYN downwelling solar and longwave irradiances was first assessed by comparison to measurements at NOAA's Surface Radiation Network (SURFRAD) reference stations and to remote mountain observations. Typical shortwave (longwave) biases had magnitudes less than 30 (10) W m(-2), with most standard deviations below 140 (30) W m(-2). The performance of a range of snow models of varying complexity when using SYN irradiances as forcing data was then evaluated. Simulated snow water equivalent and runoff from cases using SYN data fell in the range of those from simulations forced with irradiances from well-maintained surface observation sites as well as empirical methods that have been shown to perform well in mountainous terrain. The SYN irradiances are therefore judged to be suitable for use in snowmelt modeling. It is also noted that the SYN upwelling shortwave irradiances, and hence albedos derived from them, are frequently not representative of individual monitoring stations because of the high spatial variability of snow cover and other surface properties in mountainous regions.

In particular, higher total annual snow depth had a positive effect on butterfly occurrences, while spring minimum temperature and El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) sea-surface variables for April May had negative standardized coefficients. Our most important finding was that variables with large impacts at the community-level did not necessarily have a consistent response across all species. Species-level responses were much more similar to each other for snow depth compared to the other variables with strong community effects. This variation in species-level responses to weather variables raises important complications for the prediction of biotic responses to shifting climatic conditions. In addition, we found that clear associations with weather can be detected when considering ecologically delimited subsets of the community. For example, resident species and non-ruderal species had a much more unified response to weather variables compared to non-resident species and ruderal species, which suggests local adaptation to climate. These results highlight the complexity of biotic abiotic interactions and confront that complexity with methodological advances that allow ecologists to understand communities and shifting climates while simultaneously revealing species-specific variation in response to climate.",2014,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WOS:000340215900014,Adrienne,No,Yes,No,,,NA,,,,,,Meghan,No,Yes,No,Sierra Nevada Mountains,Meghan,No,Maybe,No,CA,

The study highlights key orographic influences on precipitation distributions and intensities across northern California during a landfalling atmospheric river (AR) and an associated Sierra barrier jet (SBJ). A detailed wind profiler/GPS analysis documents an intense AR overriding a shallow SBJ at similar to 750 m MSL, resulting in record early season precipitation. The SBJ diverts shallow, pre-cold-frontal, incoming water vapor within the AR poleward from the San Francisco Bay gap to the northern CV. The SBJ ultimately decays following the passage of the AR and trailing polar cold front aloft. A statistical analysis of orographic forcing reveals that both the AR and SBJ are crucial factors in determining the amount and spatial distribution of precipitation in the northern Sierra Nevada and in the Shasta-Trinity region at the northern terminus of the CV. As the AR and SBJ flow ascends the steep and tall terrain of the northern Sierra and Shasta-Trinity region, respectively, the precipitation becomes enhanced. Vertical profiles of the linear correlation coefficient quantify the orographic linkage between hourly upslope water vapor flux profiles and hourly rain rate. The altitude of maximum correlation (i.e., orographic controlling layer) is lower for the shallow SBJ than for the deeper AR (i.e., 0.90 versus 1.15 km MSL, respectively). This case study expands the understanding of orographic precipitation enhancement from coastal California to its interior. It also quantifies the connection between dry antecedent soils and reduced flood potential.",2014,10.1175/JHM-D-13-0183.1,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,WOS:000339697000006,Adrienne,No,Yes,No,,,NA,,,,,,Paris,No,,No,CA,Meghan,No,Maybe,No,Nevada,

Here we use two temporally independent data sets of vascular plant distributions, climate data, and fire atlas data to examine the influence of disturbance history on SDM projection accuracy through time in the mountain ranges of California, USA. We used hierarchical partitioning to examine the influence of fire occurrence on the distribution of 144 vascular plant species and built a suite of SDMs to examine how the inclusion of fire-related predictors (fire occurrence and departure from historical fire return intervals) affects SDM projection accuracy. Fire occurrence provided the least explanatory power among predictor variables for predicting species' distributions, but provided improved explanatory power for species whose regeneration is tied closely to fire. A measure of the departure from historic fire return interval had greater explanatory power for calibrating modern SDMs than fire occurrence. This variable did not improve internal model accuracy for most species, although it did provide marginal improvement to models for species adapted to high-frequency fire regimes. Fire occurrence and fire return interval departure were strongly related to the climatic covariates used in SDM development, suggesting that improvements in model accuracy may not be expected due to limited additional explanatory power. Our results suggest that the inclusion of coarse-scale measures of disturbance in SDMs may not be necessary to predict species distributions under climate change, particularly for disturbance processes that are largely mediated by climate.",2014,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WOS:000338109700012,Adrienne,No,No,No,,,NA,,,,,,Danny,No,Maybe,No,California,Meghan,No,Maybe,No,CA,

Bark beetle outbreaks are one such disturbance type that alters biogeochemical and biogeophysical processes in forests. Few studies have documented bark beetle impacts to leaf area index (LAI), gross primary productivity (GPP), evapotranspiration (ET), land surface temperature (LST), and surface albedo with satellite observations. Our objective was to use Landsat-derived estimates of bark beetle-caused tree mortality and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface products to estimate beetle-caused changes in LAI, GPP, ET, LST, and surface albedo in northern Colorado. Following bark beetle-caused tree mortality, decreases occurred in LAI (0.02-0.80 m(2)m(-2), 1-40%), annual GPP (50-248 gC m(-2)yr(-1), (5-26%), and daily summer ET (0.20-0.70mmday(-1), 13-44%), whereas increases occurred in August LST (1-3.9K) and February albedo (0.03-0.09, 19-52%). We found greater responses of these variables in areas of greater mortality severity. The extent and severity of tree mortality in northern Colorado caused substantial changes in land surface variables (9-23%) when averaged across all forested areas of our study area.

Do changes in component species correspond with changes across vegetation types? Do patterns of changes suggest potential drivers of change? Location: Northern two-thirds of the Sierra Nevada, CA, USA, ca. 45 000 km(2). Methods: Using two data sets that cover the span of elevations and land jurisdictions in the study area, we classified 4321 historical plots and 1000 modern plots into nine broad groups of vegetation types that are widely used by land managers and researchers in the region. We compared tree density and composition between historical and modern plots across and within these nine types. Results: In the modern data set, tree density was significantly higher in eight of nine vegetation types. Total density was significantly higher in modern plots for all west slope types, especially for montane hardwood, where modern forests are 128% denser, and mixed conifer forests, which are 69% denser. Relative density of component species was also very different between data sets in these forests, and suggests a shift in dominance toward shade-tolerant conifers and evergreen oaks. Fire suppression is likely a driving factor in these types but density was also significantly higher in high-elevation types such as sub-alpine forest (+20%), where neither fire suppression nor logging have had major impacts on structure. East slope forest types (eastside P. jeffreyi forest and pinon-juniper woodland) were very similar in both modern and historical data sets, with no significant differences in density or composition. Conclusion: West slope forest types, especially montane hardwood and mixed conifer forest, appear the most altered types of the mountain range. These types are more productive but have also been subject to greater disturbance than high-elevation and east slope forest types. Climate change may also be driving changes across the study area.

The NPS Inventory and Monitoring (I&M) program is tasked with collecting data on the natural resource condition of all 270 parks in the NPS system deemed to have significant natural resources. Synthesizing this large amount of diverse data into comprehensive assessments of ecosystem integrity has proven to be a daunting task. We provide an analysis of NPS I&M data for ten national parks located along an urban-rural gradient from Washington, DC to the Blue Ridge Mountains in the Mid-Atlantic, USA. Twelve representative metrics of ecosystem condition were selected and combined into single park scores using four separate approaches for data aggregation. The different analysis methods were compared based on criteria including the ability to differentiate among parks, sensitivity to uncertainty in assessment points, ability to use varied data sources, and information content for management. The results support the use of relatively simple methods such as distance-based aggregation scoring for long-term assessment of lands in this mixed-used landscape. Land use change within 5-km buffers adjacent to the parks was significantly correlated with overall scores and was a strong predictor of water quality measures. Urban parks generally scored slightly lower than parks located in more rural settings. However, the distance-based method penalized the urban parks less than other scoring approaches for several small problems, and urban parks scored fairly well by this recommended method. Trends in regional land use change should be carefully monitored, but at present, most of the parks along this urban-rural gradient are successfully fulfilling their mission of sustaining natural resources at a high level of ecological integrity.

Heterogenic environmental conditions result in a large variability of mountain soil properties, and thus in large uncertainties of inventories of soil organic carbon (SOC). In this study we analyzed the variability of soil properties associated with the calculation of a SOC inventory in a mountain environment in the Canadian Rocky Mountains (Alberta). Therefore, we calculated the analytical uncertainty and spatial variability of SOC stocks using Gaussian error propagation and Taylor series expansion along seventeen 36 m long transects to identify major sources of uncertainty. SOC stocks in the upper 10 cm and 30 cm are 2.4 +/- 0.7 kg C m(-2) and 6.4 +/- 5.6 kg C m(-2), respectively. The bulk densities generated the largest uncertainty associated with the analytical precision (10.0%). However, analytical uncertainties (ranging between 23 and 24.2%) are much smaller than the uncertainty introduced by the spatial variability, for instance of the coarse fraction (63.8%) and SOC concentration (40.1%). This study contributes to insufficiently considered analysis of uncertainties in SOC stocks and demonstrate the high potential of nested sampling approaches to identify sources of uncertainties of SOC stocks. To reduce the uncertainties associated with heterogeneous mountain environments, we propose to apply more sophisticated statistics (e.g regression analysis considering frequency distributions of measured coarse fractions in different geomorphic environments) rather than simple mean per unit approaches, as frequently applied in regionalization studies of soil properties.

The winter thermal regimes of Pacific Northwest headwater streams, which provide vital winter habitat for salmonids and their food sources, may be particularly sensitive to changes in climate because they can remain ice-free throughout the year and are often located in rain-on-snow zones. This study examined winter stream temperature patterns and controls in small headwater catchments within the rain-on-snow zone at the Malcolm Knapp Research Forest, near Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Two hypotheses were addressed by this study: (1) winter stream temperatures are primarily controlled by advective fluxes associated with runoff processes and (2) stream temperatures should be depressed during rain-on-snow events, compared to rain-on-bare-ground events, due to the cooling effect of rain passing through the snowpack prior to infiltrating the soil or being delivered to the stream as saturation-excess overland flow. A reach-scale energy budget analysis of two winter seasons revealed that the advective energy input associated with hillslope runoff overwhelms vertical energy exchanges (net radiation, sensible and latent heat fluxes, bed heat conduction, and stream friction) and hyporheic energy fluxes during rain and rain-on-snow events. Historical stream temperature data and modelled snowpack dynamics were used to explore the influence of transient snow cover on stream temperature over 13 winters. When snow was not present, daily stream temperature during winter rain events tended to increase with increasing air temperature. However, when snow was present, stream temperature was capped at about 5 degrees C, regardless of air temperature. The stream energy budget modelling and historical analysis support both of our hypotheses. A key implication is that climatic warming may generate higher winter stream temperatures in the rain-on-snow zone due to both increased rain temperature and reduced cooling effect of snow cover.",2014,10.5194/hess-18-819-2014,Geology; Water Resources,WOS:000332448800028,Adrienne,No,Yes,No,,tributary to the Pitt River,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Meghan,No,Maybe,No,Fraser R,

This second part of a two-part series describes site-scale model results for present and potential future conditions and confirmatory analyses for present-day conditions.

Smaller relative but larger absolute responses to climate change occur where net infiltration is large. Comparisons of distributed model estimates with temperature and geochemical observations from the unsaturated zone suggest that average estimates are generally consistent but exhibit significant variability. An observed seepage event in the South Ramp of the Exploratory Studies Facility, combined with related subsurface observations across the site, suggests that subsurface spreading from zones of high infiltration to zones of low infiltration may occur in stratabound fractures, laterally extensive discontinuities, or at transitions between welded and nonwelded tuff units. Two conceptual models for unsaturated-zone flow each explain the subsurface observations, collectively providing bounding estimates for net infiltration.

But many high-altitude reptiles that rely on external heat to survive current cold climate may benefit from future warmth. This prediction can be tested by simulating activity time and energetics of reptiles with a biophysical model. We modelled the potential response of a high-altitude snake, Trimeresurus gracilis, to a 3 degrees C increase in air temperature, using the biophysical/behavioural NicheMapper model. Using animal and environmental properties, we first analysed the effects of shade level (i.e. the reduction of solar radiation) on activity time and energetics of T.gracilis. We then computed activity time, energetics and potential habitats in its current range of Taroko National Park, Taiwan (>1800m in altitude), with a spatial climate, vegetation and topography data set. In the current climate, increased shade levels were predicted to decrease activity time, maintenance energy requirements and discretionary energy (i.e. energy left after maintenance costs are met). In heavy shade (i.e. 81100% reduction of solar radiation) at 3000 and 3500m, T.gracilis was predicted to have impaired digestive capacity and hence to be unable to meet basic maintenance costs for survival. In a warmer climate, the predicted digestive capacity, energetics and activity time of T.gracilis increase. But in heavy shade at 3500m, the digestive capacity was predicted to remain impaired for supporting basic energy requirements for survival. In the current climate, the predicted suitable habitat area (i.e. where T.gracilis obtains positive discretionary energy) in coniferous and coniferousbroadleaf forests decreased with increasing elevation. At elevations higher than 3000m, most suitable habitats were in open areas like grasslands where T.gracilis was also predicted to have more discretionary energy than in heavily forested habitats. Our field sightings agreed with model predictions. A warmer climate was generally predicted to increase the activity time, energetics and habitat area, given the current vegetation pattern. Overall, we demonstrate that metabolism, digestive function and vegetative shade levels are critical elements affecting T.gracilis' energetics and habitats with climate change.

Given the long-term nature of the multidisciplinary dataset, we are able to provide an overview of the complex interaction between streamflow and fish population dynamics drawing on previously published material as well as new data analyses. For autumn-spawning fishes like the Atlantic salmon, access to headwater reaches was directly related to streamflow during late October (when they ascend spawning tributaries), as well as the propensity of beaver dams in the stream (also a function of streamflow). Winter streamflow was positively correlated with egg survival, except when rain-on-snow conditions induced severe ice break-up events that likely caused the highest mortalities on record for salmon and other fishes. Juvenile recruitment was significantly influenced by density-dependent processes of growth and competition but further mediated by density-independent factors like winter flow. In spring, fry emergence was largely temperature-driven, although peaks in fry drift were sometimes synchronized with secondary discharge peaks and temperature. Tributaries like Catamaran Brook provide thermal refugia for coolwater fishes like salmon and trout during the summer when wide, shallow main-stem Atlantic rivers experience low discharge and high water temperatures that induce physiological and behavioural stress (i.e. >23 degrees C). These phenomena are discussed in detail, especially in terms of how they may be compromised by future changes in hydrologic conditions resulting from predicted climate change scenarios.

Associated environmental changes, including snow cover and vegetation, were not considered in the modelling. Permafrost extent increases from 58% of the area (present day: 1971-2000) to 76% under a -1 K cooling scenario, whereas warming scenarios decrease the percentage of permafrost area exponentially to 38% (+ 1 K), 24% (+ 2 K), 17% (+ 3 K), 12% (+ 4 K) and 9% (+ 5 K) of the area. The morphology of permafrost gain/loss under these scenarios is controlled by the surface lapse rate (SLR, i.e. air temperature elevation gradient), which varies across the region below treeline. Areas that are maritime exhibit SLRs characteristically similar above and below treeline resulting in low probabilities of permafrost in valley bottoms. When warming scenarios are applied, a loss front moves to upper elevations (simple unidirectional spatial loss). Areas where SLRs are gently negative below treeline and normal above treeline exhibit a loss front moving up-mountain at different rates according to two separate SLRs (complex unidirectional spatial loss). Areas that display high continentally exhibit bidirectional spatial loss in which the loss front moves up-mountain above treeline and down-mountain below treeline.

I describe the snakes of this locality using 179 isolated vertebrae from all parts of the vertebral column as well as cranial elements. The assemblage comprises four species: (1) a primitive burrowing snake (""anilioid""); (2) a small boid related to Ungaliophiinae (dwarf boas); (3) a mid-sized booid related to Loxocemus (Mexican Burrowing Python); and (4) a colubrid. The dwarf boa, Calamagras weigeli, is conservatively regarded as the earliest secure representative of the total clade of Ungaliophiinae, but the history of this clade may stretch considerably further back. The loxocemid, Ogmophis compactus, is only the second reported fossil of that clade. The colubrid is one of the earliest known and could represent the first appearance of colubrine ""racers"" in North America; it may have had an elongate tail, but this is not yet statistically clear. Full-column analysis and cranial elements prove crucial for the accurate higher-level identification of snake clades from which these isolated elements derive. The past assignment of most North American Paleogene taxa to Erycinae (sand boas) is further undone in this work; there is no well-founded record of an erycine in North America prior to the Miocene.

These models are typically applied over a range of scales, from headwater streams to higher order rivers, and for a variety of purposes, such as evaluating changes to aquatic habitat or reservoir operation. Most hydrologic models require streamflow data to calibrate subsurface drainage parameters. In many cases, long-term gage records may not be available for calibration, particularly when assessments are focused on low-order stream reaches. Consequently, hydrologic modeling of climate change impacts is often performed in the absence of sufficient data to fully parameterize these hydrologic models. In this paper, we assess a geologic-based strategy for assigning drainage parameters. We examine the performance of this modeling strategy for the McKenzie River watershed in the US Oregon Cascades, a region where previous work has demonstrated sharp contrasts in hydrology based primarily on geological differences between the High and Western Cascades. Based on calibration and verification using existing streamflow data, we demonstrate that: (1) a set of streams ranging from 1st to 3rd order within the Western Cascade geologic region can share the same drainage parameter set, while (2) streams from the High Cascade geologic region require a different parameter set. Further, we show that a watershed comprised of a mixture of High and Western Cascade geologies can be modeled without additional calibration by transferring parameters from these distinctive High and Western Cascade end-member parameter sets. More generally, we show that by defining a set of end-member parameters that reflect different geologic classes, we can more efficiently apply a hydrologic model over a geologically complex landscape and resolve geo-climatic differences in how different watersheds are likely to respond to simple warming scenarios.",2013,10.5194/hess-17-341-2013,Geology; Water Resources,WOS:000314802400022,Becky,Yes,Yes,Yes,Landscape/State-Province,"Cascades, hydrologic modeling (may provide info. relevant to this basin)",NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Meghan,No,Maybe,No,"Cascades, hydrologic modeling (may provide info. relevant to this basin)",

However, these changes can alternatively be used as a measure of climate variability. Our study site, ca. 18.0cal. ka BP record from Little Brooklyn Lake, Wyoming, located near the crest of the Snowy Range, records three moisture states. Initially, the lake was likely a glacier-fed pond indicated by the presence of Pediastrum algae colonies. Around 13.0 cal. ka BP this pond transitioned to a meadow environment, suggested by the loss of Pediastrum algae colonies and slow sedimentation rates. Meadow conditions were maintained until ca. 5.0 cal. ka BP when Pediastrum algae colony abundance increased,indicating the formation of a shallow lake. From 18.0 to ca. 5.0 cal. ka BP, the pollen record is suggestive of alpine vegetation conditions with relatively high spruce and herbaceous taxa. Low charcoal influx also characterizes the period between 18.0 and 5.0 cal. ka BP. After 5.0 cal. ka BP, the coincidence of the formation of shallow lake and pollen data, indicating a shift to a spruce and fir forest, suggests an increase in effective moisture.

The objective of this study was to determine how fuels, forest structure, and predicted fire behavior changed 7-years after initial treatments. Three different treatments: mechanical only, mechanical plus fire, and prescribed fire only, as well as untreated control, were each randomly applied to 3 of 12 experimental units. Many aspects of the initial fuel treatments changed in 7 years. The overall hazard of the control units increased significantly indicating continued passive management has further increased already high fire hazards. Mechanical only fire hazard decreased after 7 years and are now similar to the two fire treatments, which both maintained low hazards throughout the study. Tree density declined significantly 7 years after the initial fire only treatments, while basal area in both fire treatments was unchanged relative to immediate post-treatment conditions. Our findings indicating reduced fire hazard over time in mechanical only treatments might provide an opportunity for a staggered treatment schedule that included prescribed fire which could increase overall treatment longevity to approximately 20 years.

Stand-replacing fires and outbreaks of mountain pine beetle (MPB), Dendroctonus ponderosae, are both important disturbances in the lodgepole pine, Pinus contorta, forests of the Rocky Mountains. In the current study we investigated how time since the last stand-replacing fire affects the susceptibility of the stand to MPB outbreaks in these forests. We hypothesized that at a stand-scale, young post-fire stands (< c. 100150 years old) are less susceptible to past and current MPB outbreaks than are older stands. Location Colorado, USA. Methods We used dendroecological methods to reconstruct stand-origin dates and the history of outbreaks in 23 lodgepole pine stands. Results The relatively narrow range of establishment dates among the oldest trees in most sampled stands suggested that these stands originated after stand-replacing or partially stand-replacing fires over the past three centuries. Stands were affected by MPB outbreaks in the 1940s/1950s, 1980s and 2000s/2010s. Susceptibility to outbreaks generally increased with stand age (i.e. time since the last stand-replacing fire). However, this reduced susceptibility of younger post-fire stands was most pronounced for the 1940s/1950s outbreak, less so for the 1980s outbreak, and did not hold true for the 2000s/2010s outbreak. Main conclusions Younger stands may not have been less susceptible to the most recent outbreak because: (1) after stands reach a threshold age of > 100150 years, stand age does not affect susceptibility to outbreaks, or (2) the high intensity of the most recent outbreak reduces the importance of pre-disturbance conditions for susceptibility to disturbance. If the warm and dry conditions that contribute to MPB outbreaks concurrently increase the frequency and/or extent of severe fires, they may thereby mitigate the otherwise increased landscape-scale susceptibility to outbreaks. Potential increases in severe fires driven by warm and dry climatic trends may lead to a negative feedback by making lodgepole pine stands less susceptible to future MPB outbreaks.",2012,10.1111/j.1365-2699.2012.02748.x,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Physical Geography,WOS:000310266600013,Becky,No,Yes,No,,Colorado.

We investigated the altitudinal pattern of conifer mortality that occurred from 2002 to 2004 in Southern California's San Jacinto Mountains. We found that conifer mortality was focused in the lower portion of the midmontane conifer range, which drove the midmontane conifer distribution upslope. We investigated past reports of conifer mortality in Southern California by searching historical newspaper accounts. We found evidence of previous episodes of conifer mortality that coincided with past droughts, and which may have caused vegetation redistribution in the past. We interpret the early 2000s mortality and associated vegetation redistribution as a response to natural decadal to centennial climate variability.

Fieldwork was carried out between July and September 2007 at Place Lake, located below Place Glacier in the southern Coast Mountains of British Columbia. Place Lake has an area of 72000 m2, a single inlet and outlet channel, and an approximate residence time of 4 days. Warming between the inlet and outlet of the lake ranged up to 3 degrees C and averaged 1.8 degrees C, which exceeds the amount of warming that occurred over the 1?km reach of Place Creek between the lake outlet and tree line. Over a 23-day period, net radiation totalled about 210?MJ center dot m2, with sensible heat flux adding another 56MJm-2. The latent heat flux consumed about 8% of the surface heat input. The dominant heat sink was the net horizontal advection associated with lake inflow and outflow. Early in the study period, temperatures between the surface and 6-m depth were dominantly at or above 4 degrees C and were generally neutral to thermally stable, whereas temperatures decreased with depth below 6-m and exhibited irregular sub-diurnal variations. The maximum outflow temperature of almost 7 degrees C occurred in this period. We hypothesize that turbidity currents associated with cold, sediment-laden glacier discharge formed an underflow and influenced temperatures in the deeper portion of the lake but did not mix with the upper layers. Later in the study period, the lake was dominantly well mixed with some near-surface stability associated with nocturnal cooling. Further research is required to examine the combined effects of sediment concentrations and thermal processes on mixing in small proglacial lakes to make projections of the consequences of glacier retreat on alpine lake and stream temperatures.

Chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), and tritium (H-3) data collected in prior studies from 1997 to 2003 are re-interpreted and combined with new data collected in 2009 and 2010. The age record is analyzed to explore the potential value of groundwater age monitoring for (1) providing additional constraints on the age distribution in mixed-age samples, and (2) identifying temporal changes in groundwater recharge. Motivation for this study is provided by a lack of knowledge of how groundwater recharge and discharge (stream baseflow) in mountain watersheds might respond to climate change, and a resulting need to better understand mountain aquifer residence times, storage, and recharge. Piston-flow ages for the springs generally range from 10 to 50 yr. The plausibility of different age mixing models is tested by comparing observed temporal variations in age with those simulated using simple numerical models, and by examining plots comparing the concentrations of different age tracers. We find that most spring waters are best characterized by a bimodal mixing model consisting of a new (<1 yr old) fraction and a fraction that is older, but still modern (recharged after 1950). Identification of this mixing model would not have been possible without data from multiple age tracers and data from multiple years. Computed mean ages vary substantially (often by 3-7 yr) between sampling events for most springs, including those with ages of 20-50 yr. Mean age variations are likely controlled by variations in the magnitude of the new fraction, which is positively correlated with annual snowpack water content. Most springs show overall upward trends in mean age for the sampling period, consistent with decreasing recharge rates in response to diminishing snowpack. Groundwater age monitoring appears to be a potentially valuable tool for both constraining the age distribution in sampled waters and investigating recharge transients.

Consequently, there is value in investigating the connectivity of populations of species inhabiting different environments in order to evaluate dispersal as a potential strategy for persistence in the face of climate change. Here, we begin to investigate the processes that shape genetic variation within American pika populations from the northern periphery of their range, the central Coast Mountains of British Columbia, Canada. At these latitudes, pikas inhabit sharp elevation gradients ranging from sea level to 1500 m, providing an excellent system for studying the effects of local environmental conditions on pika population genetic structure and gene flow. We found low levels of neutral genetic variation compared to previous studies from more southerly latitudes, consistent with the relatively recent post-glacial colonization of the study location. Moreover, significant levels of inbreeding and marked genetic structure were detected within and among sites. Although low levels of recent gene flow were revealed among elevations within a transect, potentially admixed individuals and first generation migrants were identified using discriminant analysis of principal components between populations separated by less than five kilometers at the same elevations. There was no evidence for historical population decline, yet there was signal for recent demographic contractions, possibly resulting from environmental stochasticity. Correlative analyses revealed an association between patterns of genetic variation and annual heat-to-moisture ratio, mean annual precipitation, precipitation as snow and mean maximum summer temperature. Changes in climatic regimes forecasted for the region may thus potentially increase the rate of population extirpation by further reducing dispersal between sites.

We first exploit interannual variability to demonstrate the sensitivity of snowpack to temperature during the various phases of the snow season. We show that mechanisms whereby temperature affects snowpack emerge in the mid to late portion of the snow season (March through May), but are nearly absent during the earliest phase (February), when temperatures are generally well below freezing. The mid to late snow season is precisely when significant loss of snowpack is seen at nearly all locations over the past few decades, both through decreases in snow accumulation and increases in snowmelt. At locations where April 1st SWE has been increasing over the past few decades, the increase is entirely due to a significant enhancement of accumulation during the earliest phase of the snow season, when the sensitivity analysis indicates that temperature is not expected to affect snowpack. Later in the snow season, these stations exhibit significant snowpack loss comparable to the other stations. Based on this analysis, it is difficult to escape the conclusion that recent snowpack changes in western North America are caused by regional-scale warming. Given predictions of future warming, a further reduction in late season snowpack and advancement in the onset of snowmelt should be expected in the coming decades throughout the region.",NA,,,,Becky,Yes,Yes,Yes,Landscape/State-Province,,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Meghan,No,Maybe,No,ca,

The phytoplankton community variation was examined in the context of the changes in physical and chemical properties of Green Lake 4. The physical changes associated with the 2002 drought included warmer surface water temperatures and greater hydraulic residence times; whereas the chemical changes included higher concentrations of acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) and major ions. During the summer of 2002 the phytoplankton community was dominated by Synedra sp. and Ankyra sp.; two previously rare species. The growth of Synedra sp. was sufficient to cause a decrease in silica concentrations, which has not been observed in other summers in the water quality monitoring record. The results of a redundancy analysis (RDA) indicated that concentrations of major ions and ANC were aligned with Synedra sp. and Ankyra sp. during the 2002 drought year. Following the 2002 drought year, Chrysococcus sp. and Chlorococcum sp., which became abundant, were aligned with nitrate in the RDA. These results indicate that the response of the phytoplankton community to the extreme drought was most strongly correlated with water quality changes the occurred, rather than temperature and hydraulic residence time.

The main purpose of the paper is to evaluate the validity of these models by documenting facies relationships and detailed bedding architecture of bar and channel deposits as well as mudstone sandstone ratio within a compound incised-valley fill at the top of the Cretaceous Ferron Sandstone Member of the Mancos Shale Formation in the Henry Mountains region, Utah, U.S.A. Field photomosaics, walking out of beds, and 42 measured sections document the stratal and facies organization in the incised-valley fill. Two erosional surfaces with erosional relief up to 17 m are traced continuously for up to 7 km. These erosional surfaces are defined by onlap and truncation and show a marked basinward shift in facies, with pebbly coarse-grained and conglomeratic fluvial sandstones overlying highly burrowed marine mudstones and sandstones. These major erosional surfaces partition the valley fill into two sequences, marked as V2 and V1 in ascending order. Each sequence comprises a multistory fill that reaches a maximum thickness of about 30 m. Within each sequence there is a vertical transition in facies from fluvial, to tidal, and finally back into fluvial facies. In the younger VI, there is a systematic vertical evolution of fluvial style from braided, to single-thread meandering, and finally to a low-sinuosity river system. In contrast, formative rivers in the older V2 were always meandering and show more marine and tidal influence. A major change in valley sedimentology is recognized from V2 to V1, as shown by a 30 eastward shift in main flow direction, overall increase in grain size and river discharge, and a clear change in fluvial style from meandering into braided streams. This is also shown by the increase in preserved dune height in fluvial bar and channel deposits across the boundary, which suggests that deeper rivers cut the younger V1 valley. The change in river style from braided to meandering in VI is interpreted to reflect a gradual decrease in slope and discharge as the valley was filled. The change in fluvial style across the sequence boundary reflects an increase in grain size and discharge, probably driven by a high-frequency climate change, as well as local increase in valley slope.",2010,10.2110/jsr.2010.053,Geology,WOS:000278573800010,Courtney,No,,No,,Utah,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Meghan,No,Maybe,No,Utah,

Stated as a hypothesis: given the natural range of temporal variability of meadow vegetation, a significant portion of that variability is attributed to the effects of climatic variation. The study is associated with the Global Observation Research Initiative in Alpine Environments Project (GLORIA) hosted by the University of California White Mountain Research Station. Both meadows are sedge-rush-grass wet meadows, or fens, which are sustained by surface water in the form of streams and springs. A comprehensive plant list was compiled and the plant species of each meadow were sampled by a point intercept method along two randomly placed transects. The occurrence of all species at predetermined one-meter interval sample points along the transects were recorded, percent occurrence was calculated, and descriptive statistics were done. The monitoring objective is to detect a 20% biologically meaningful change in the vegetation over time with 90% confidence, and accept a 10% chance of a false change error (Type 1 error). Monitoring is planned to be done in conjunction with tracking change in precipitation and temperature. Three indicators of possible climate change were chosen. One indicator is increase in the abundance of those species whose upper range is at or below meadow elevations. The rationale for this indicator is based the 2007 IPCC report estimation that a doubling of atmospheric CO(2) will increase global temperature with a best estimate of +3.0 degrees C. Assuming that the present general lapse rate of -6.32 degrees C per kilometer for the White Mountains will persist, a 3.0 degrees C increase may result in an equivalent elevation of the meadows of about +475 m. Published elevation ranges indicate that most recorded species are not likely to be affected by the estimated temperature increase. Second and third indicators are a shift in cover from wet meadow to dry meadow species, and the presence and increase of shrub species resulting from postulated reduced precipitation with drying of meadows and encroachment by surrounding shrubs (sagebrush and rabbitbrush). This monitoring study has the potential to detect long-term responses of vegetation to climate change, and reduce uncertainties and confirm or correct the expected consequences of temperature change.

Long-held models of the timing, duration, and magnitude of glaciation are being reevaluated due to emerging evidence from former high latitudes, evidence that the late Paleozoic ice age was punctuated by long-lived glacial minima or possibly ice-free times. The history of the late Paleozoic ice age is archived within the biostratigraphically well-constrained, carbonate-dominated succession of Arrow Canyon, Nevada, United States. In this paleo-tropical succession, the distribution of lithofacies, flooding surfaces, and subaerial exposure horizons and their stacking into meter-scale cycles record a detailed climate history. The onset of this phase of glaciation during the middle Mississippian was followed by a dynamic evolution of glacioeustasy through the late Mississippian to late Pennsylvanian. Moderate-to high-amplitude glacioeustasy was likely interrupted by an earliest Pennsylvanian short-lived glacial minimum, but otherwise appears to have persisted through the middle Pennsylvanian. Upper Pennsylvanian strata record low-to moderate-amplitude relative sea-level changes, suggesting a long-lived interval of diminished ice volume. This proposed glacial minimum is coincident with a notable minimum in glaciogenic sedimentation near the former southern pole, aridification across paleo-tropical Pangea, and significant floral and faunal turnover, suggesting a link between tropical environmental change and high-latitude glaciation. These conclusions, however, are at odds with those traditionally inferred from Euramerican cyclothems, i.e., persistent high-amplitude glacioeustasy driven by a single, large ice sheet. Rather, the Arrow Canyon archive of varying depositional facies and cycle stacking patterns records major changes in the magnitude of short-term glacioeustasy. This finding contributes to recent and growing near-and far-field evidence for a more dynamic glaciation history than previously inferred from the classic Euramerican cyclothems.",2010,10.1130/GES00192.1,Geology,WOS:000274596000001,Courtney,No,,No,,Nevada,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Meghan,No,Maybe,No,Nevada,

Now, climate change threatens the regional allocation of water. Tree-ring records indicate that past centuries contained multidecadal ""megadroughts"" far more severe than those of the historic period. However, the potential for even more persistent droughts, as the result of climate change, is poorly known. We document and evaluate the severity of recent and prehistoric droughts via a combination of data sources: modern temperature, precipitation, and stream gauge data; evidence of low lake-level stands; and related estimates of past hydroclimate change. Modern climate and stream data show an increase in spring temperatures of 2.21 degrees C since 1916, an increase in the frequency of peak spring runoff before 1 May, and a reduction in winter precipitation. Lakes, however, that have only experienced minor hydrologic changes historically were desiccated during prehistoric dry periods during the past 12,000 years. Prehistoric lake shorelines indicate that water supplies were substantially reduced over centuries and millennia, such as from >8,000 to <5,000 years before present. The magnitude of these droughts likely also resulted in ephemeral river flows and thus indicates the potential for persistent shifts in regional hydrology.

Among the possible causes, habitat change is discussed. This article focuses on potentially increased levels of fine sediments going to rivers and their effects on gravel-spawning brown trout. Indications of increased erosion rates are evident from land-use change in agriculture, changes in forest management practices, and from climate change. The latter induces an increase in air and river water temperatures, reduction in permafrost, changes in snow dynamics and an increase in heavy rain events. As a result, an increase in river sediment is likely. Suspended sediment may affect fish health and behaviour directly. Furthermore, sediment loads may clog gravel beds impeding fish such as brown trout from spawning and reducing recruitment rates. To assess the potential impact on fine sediments, knowledge of brown trout reproductive needs and the effects of sediment on brown trout health were evaluated. We critically reviewed the literature and included results from ongoing studies to answer the following questions, focusing on recent decades and rivers in alpine countries. Have climate change and land-use change increased erosion and sediment loads in rivers? Do we have indications of an increase in riverbed clogging? Are there indications of direct or indirect effects on brown trout from increased suspended sediment concentrations in rivers or from an increase in riverbed clogging? Rising air temperatures have led to more intensive precipitation in winter months, earlier snow melt in spring, and rising snow lines and hence to increased erosion. Intensification of land use has supported erosion in lowland and pre-alpine areas in the second half of the twentieth century. In the Alps, however, reforestation of abandoned land at high altitudes might reduce the erosion risk while intensification on the lower, more easily accessible slopes increases erosion risk. Data from laboratory experiments show that suspended sediments affect the health and behaviour of fish when available in high amounts. Point measurements in large rivers indicate no common lethal threat and suspended sediment is rarely measured continuously in small rivers. However, effects on fish can be expected under environmentally relevant conditions. River bed clogging impairs the reproductive performance of gravel-spawning fish. Overall, higher erosion and increased levels of fine sediment going into rivers are expected in future. Additionally, sediment loads in rivers are suspected to have considerably impaired gravel bed structure and brown trout spawning is impeded. Timing of discharge is put forward and is now more likely to affect brown trout spawning than in previous decades. Reports on riverbed clogging from changes in erosion and fine sediment deposition patterns, caused by climate change and land-use change are rare. This review identifies both a risk of increases in climate erosive forces and fine sediment loads in rivers of alpine countries. Increased river discharge and sediment loads in winter and early spring could be especially harmful for brown trout reproduction and development of young life stages. Recently published studies indicate a decline in trout reproduction from riverbed clogging in many rivers in lowlands and alpine regions. However, the multitude of factors in natural complex ecosystems makes it difficult to address a single causative factor. Further investigations into the consequences of climate change and land-use change on river systems are needed. Small rivers, of high importance for the recruitment of gravel-spawning fish, are often neglected. Studies on river bed clogging are rare and the few existing studies are not comparable. Thus, there is a strong need for the development of methods to assess sediment input and river bed clogging. As well, studies on the effects to fish from suspended sediments and consequences of gravel beds clogging under natural conditions are urgently needed.",2009,10.1007/s11356-008-0075-3,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WOS:000263682700013,Courtney,No,,No,,Alps,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Meghan,No,Maybe,International,Alps,

To investigate these two options, we deconvolved fission-track (FT) and U/Pb ages of detrital zircons from stratigraphically coordinated samples collected in the northern Robinson Mountains into component populations. The strata of the Yakutat terrane include the Middle Eocene Kulthieth Formation, the Lower Oligocene to Lower Miocene Poul Creek Formation, and the Miocene-Pleistocene Yakataga Formation. The Kulthieth and Poul Creek formations record erosion of a simple, uniform, long-lived, nonvolcanic source terrain that crystallized from similar to 50 to 220 Ma and cooled from similar to 40 to 110 Ma. Miocene cooling episodes recorded in the source to the Kulthieth and Poul Creek formations are likely associated with plutons in the northern Coast Plutonic Complex and the Kuiu-Etoilin belt. The Upper Miocene to Pleistocene Yakataga Formation records erosion of rocks that crystallized from similar to 50 to 53 Ma and cooled below the zircon FT closure at similar to 70-20 Ma. Upper Miocene strata are likely derived from erosion of the Chugach-Prince William terranes and the superimposed Sanak-Baranof plutonic belt. The uniform provenance of the Kulthieth and Poul Creek formations, the overall FT grain age distribution, and the distinct lack of volcanic zircons favor a northern position of the Yakutat terrane since the Eocene.

The enhanced melting of glaciers leads at first to increased run-off and discharge peaks and an increased melt season, while in the longer time frame glacier wasting can be so severe that it results in decreased run-off. Glacier basins with a decreasing run-off trend have been observed in south-central British Columbia, at low elevations in the Swiss Alps and in the central Andes of Chile, which is probably a combined effect of reduced melt from seasonal snow cover as the snow line rises, and relevant glacier area losses. In contrast, significant run-off increases are reported in Alberta, north-western British Columbia and Yukon in Canada, in highly glacierized basins in the Swiss and Austrian Alps, the Tianshan Mountains and Tibet in central Asia and in the tropical Andes of Peru. The run-off increase within these basins is closely related to observed temperature rise, indicating that there is an unequivocal signal of enhanced glacier melting under the present warming trends.

The 4 elevational ecoregions sampled included the Boreal Highlands (BH: 13 sites); the Foothills (FH: 36 sites); a grouping of the montane and subalpine zones of the southern Rocky Mountains (RM: 12 sites); and the montane zone of the Cypress Hills (CH: 4 sites). The first diameter size class was comprised of the three largest (top) diameter trees at each site. The tree list of each plot was ranked, then divided into three groups of equal basal area and the tree at the midpoint of each group (small, medium, and large) was selected for the other three size classes. Annual growth in basal area of lodgepole pine was generally sensitive to heat and moisture stress in late summer of the previous year, the degree of winter harshness, and the timing of the start of the growing season. Growth was inhibited by low temperature in all winter months at the most northern BH sites which had the coldest winters, but this effect was interrupted in some of the midwinter months in the more southerly sites in the RM, and we postulated this was due to the damaging influences of Chinook winds. Interannual growth patterns were strongly correlated between top diameter trees and the other classes, and trees of all diameter classes generally responded to climate in the same way, which indicated that it is sufficient to sample only the largest diameter trees in a stand to provide insight into growth-climate relationships. The forecasted growth estimates indicate that future climate warming will negatively impact the productivity of lodgepole pine in the FH, the heart of lodgepole distribution and productivity in Alberta.

A more robust approach for inferring the impacts of global warming is to estimate the temperature sensitivity (lambda) of spring snowpack and multiply it by putative past and future temperature rises observed across the Northern Hemisphere. Estimates of lambda can be obtained from (i) simple geometric considerations based on the notion that as the seasonal-mean temperature rises by the amount delta T, the freezing level and the entire snowpack should rise by the increment delta T/Gamma, where Gamma is the mean lapse rate; (ii) the regression of 1 April SWE measurements upon mean winter temperatures; (iii) a hydrological model forced by daily temperature and precipitation observations; and (iv) the use of inferred accumulated snowfall derived from daily temperature and precipitation data as a proxy for SWE. All four methods yield an estimated sensitivity of 20% of spring snowpack lost per degree Celsius temperature rise. The increase of precipitation accompanying a 1 degrees C warming can be expected to decrease the sensitivity to 16%. Considering observations of temperature rise over the Northern Hemisphere, it is estimated that spring snow-water equivalent in the Cascades portion of the Puget Sound drainage basin should have declined by 8%-16% over the past 30 yr resulting from global warming, and it can be expected to decline by another 11%-21% by 2050.

More compelling evidence - such as tectonic changes in response to ( rather than just coincident with) climate change - has, however, rarely been documented. Triggered by a climate-driven increase in erosion rate, friction-dominated mountain ranges are expected to show a number of simultaneous responses: a decrease in the width of the range, a temporary increase in sediment yield, a persistent increase in the rate of rock uplift and a reduction in the subsidence rate of surrounding basins.

Alterations in flooding regimes associated with climate change have the potential to negatively affect fish species with earlier fry emergence and alter the fish communities in tributary streams where fall- and spring-spawning salmonids coexist or where there may be invasion potential by a given species. This 6-year study (2002-2007) assessed the effects of the timing and magnitude of spring flood events on year-class strength in sympatric Populations of fall-spawning brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis, fall-spawning brown trout Salmo trutta. and spring-spawning rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss.

In mountain environments, complex topography creates heterogeneity in key controls on transpiration as well as logistical challenges for collecting representative measurements. In these settings, ecosystem models can be used to account for variation in space and time of the dominant controls on transpiration and provide estimates of transpiration patterns and their sensitivity to climate variability and change. The Regional Hydro-Ecological Simulation System (RHESSys) model was used to assess elevational differences in sensitivity of transpiration rates to the spatiotemporal variability of climate variables across the Upper Merced River watershed, Yosemite Valley, California, USA. At the basin scale, predicted annual transpiration was lowest in driest and wettest years, and greatest in moderate precipitation years (R-2 = 0.32 and 0.29, based on polynomial regression of maximum snow depth and annual precipitation, respectively). At finer spatial scales, responsiveness of transpiration rates to climate differed along an elevational gradient. Low elevations (1200-1800 m) showed little interannual variation in transpiration due to topographically controlled high soil moistures along the river corridor. Annual conifer stand transpiration at intermediate elevations (1800-2150 m) responded more strongly to precipitation. resulting in a unimodal relationship between transpiration and precipitation where highest transpiration occurred during moderate precipitation levels, regardless of annual air temperatures. Higher elevations (2150-2600 m) maintained this trend, but air temperature sensitivities were greater. At these elevations, snowfall provides enough moisture for growth, and increased temperatures influenced transpiration. Transpiration at the highest elevations (2600-4000 m) showed strong sensitivity to air temperature. little sensitivity to precipitation. Model results suggest elevational differences in vegetation water use and sensitivity to climate were significant and will likely play a key role in controlling responses and vulnerability of Sierra Nevada ecosystems to climate change.

Many cold-adapted alpine species have responded to these climatic changes with long-distance range shifts. These species typically exhibit shallow genetic differentiation over a large geographical area. In contrast, poorly dispersing organisms often form species complexes within mountain ranges, such as the California endemic ice-crawlers (Grylloblattodea: Grylloblattidae: Grylloblatta). The diversification pattern of poorly dispersing species might provide more information on the localized effects of historical climate change, the importance of particular climatic events, as well as the history of dispersal. Here we use multi-locus genetic data to examine the phylogenetic relationships and geographic pattern of diversification in California Grylloblatta. Results: Our analysis reveals a pattern of deep genetic subdivision among geographically isolated populations of Grylloblatta in California. Alpine populations diverged from low elevation populations and subsequently diversified. Using a Bayesian relaxed clock model and both uncalibrated and calibrated measurements of time to most recent common ancestor, we reconstruct the temporal diversification of alpine Grylloblatta populations. Based on calibrated relaxed clock estimates, evolutionary diversification of Grylloblatta occurred during the Pliocene-Pleistocene epochs, with an initial dispersal into California during the Pliocene and species diversification in alpine clades during the middle Pleistocene epoch. Conclusions: Grylloblatta species exhibit a high degree of genetic subdivision in California with well defined geographic structure. Distinct glacial refugia can be inferred within the Sierra Nevada, corresponding to major, glaciated drainage basins. Low elevation populations are sister to alpine populations, suggesting alpine populations may track expanding glacial ice sheets and diversify as a result of multiple glacial advances. Based on relaxed-clock molecular dating, the temporal diversification of Grylloblatta provides evidence for the role of a climate-driven species pump in alpine species during the Pleistocene epoch.",NA,,,,Courtney,No,,No,,Sierra Nevada,NA,,,,,,Becky,No,Yes,No, California Grylloblatta,Meghan,No,Maybe,No,ca,

To better understand the historical range of variation (HRV) of fire in sagebrush ecosystems and whether sagebrush fire regimes today have too much or too little fire, I estimated fire rotation (expected time to burn the area of a landscape) in sagebrush ecosystems under the HRV. Estimates derived from five sources are >200 years in little sagebrush (A. arbuscula), 200-350 years in Wyoming big sagebrush (A. tridentata ssp. wyomingensis), 150-300 years in mountain big sagebrush (A. t. ssp. vaseyana), and 40-230 years in mountain grasslands containing patches of mountain big sagebrush with longer rotations in areas where sagebrush intermixes with forests. Landscape dynamics under the HRV were likely dominated in all sagebrush areas by infrequent episodes of large, high-severity fires followed by long interludes with smaller, patchier fires, allowing mature sagebrush to dominate for extended periods. Fire rotation, estimated from recent fire records, suggests fire exclusion had little effect onfire in sagebrush ecosystems. Instead, cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum), human-set fires, and global warming may have led to too much fire relative to the HRV in four floristic provinces within the range of sagebrush in the western United States. Sagebrush ecosystems would generally benefit from rest from disturbance. Global warming is likely to increase fire, and widespread prescribed burning of sagebrush is unnecessary. Where cheatgrass occurs, fire suppression is sensible. In areas of depleted understories, restoration to re-establish native plants is needed if sagebrush ecosystems are to effectively recover from future disturbance.",2011,,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Zoology,WOS:000295869900014,Danny,No,No,No,Landscape/State-Province,Sage Grouse- Rangelands,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Meghan,No,Maybe,No,Sage Grouse- Rangelands,Yes

The number of Santa Ana days per winter season is approximately 20% fewer in the mid 21st century compared to the late 20th century. Since the only systematic and sustained difference between these two periods is the level of anthropogenic forcing, this effect is anthropogenic in origin. In both time periods, Santa Ana winds are partly katabatically-driven by a temperature difference between the cold wintertime air pooling in the desert against coastal mountains and the adjacent warm air over the ocean. However, this katabatic mechanism is significantly weaker during the mid 21st century time period. This occurs because of the well-documented differential warming associated with transient climate change, with more warming in the desert interior than over the ocean. Thus the mechanism responsible for the decrease in Santa Ana frequency originates from a well-known aspect of the climate response to increasing greenhouse gases, but cannot be understood or simulated without mesoscale atmospheric dynamics. In addition to the change in Santa Ana frequency, we investigate changes during Santa Anas in two other meteorological variables known to be relevant to fire weather conditions-relative humidity and temperature. We find a decrease in the relative humidity and an increase in temperature. Both these changes would favor fire. A fire behavior model accounting for changes in wind, temperature, and relative humidity simultaneously is necessary to draw firm conclusions about future fire risk and growth associated with Santa Ana events.

Landform surface properties influence the role these mountains have in geomorphic processes such as dust flux and surface hydrology across the region. The primary goal of this study was to describe and quantify land surface properties of arid-mountain landforms as a step toward unraveling the role these properties have in soil-geomorphic processes. As part of a larger soil-geomorphic study, four major landform types were identified within the southern Fry Mountains in the southwestern Mojave Desert on the basis of topography and landscape position: mountaintop, mountainflank, mountainflat (intra-range low-relief surface), and mountainbase. A suite of rock, vegetation, and morphometric land surface characteristic variables was measured at each of 65 locations across the study area, which included an associated piedmont and playa. Our findings show that despite the variation within types, landforms have distinct land surface properties that likely control soil-geomorphic processes. We hypothesize that surface expression influences a feedback process at this site where water transports sediment to low lying areas on the landscape and wind carries dust and soluble salts to the mountains where they are washed between rocks, incorporated into the soil, and retained as relatively long-term storage. Recent land-based video and satellite photographs of the dust cloud emanating from the Sierra Cucapa Mountains in response to the 7.2-magnitude earthquake near Mexicali, Mexico, support the hypothesis that these landforms are massive repositories of dust.

The first occurred during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition (similar to 12.5-9.5 ka) and is interpreted as paraglacial landscape response to deglaciation after the LGM. Evidence of the second period of aggradation is limited but indicates a small pulse of sedimentation at similar to 5.5 ka. A third, more broadly identifiable period of sedimentation occurred in the late Holocene (similar to 2.2-1 ka). The latest two periods of aggradation are concurrent with increases in the frequency of climate change in the region suggesting that Holocene alpine and sub-alpine landscapes respond more to rapid changes in climate than to large singular climatic swings. Soil development and radiocarbon dating indicate that hillslopes were stable during the Holocene even while aggradation was occurring in valley bottoms. Thus, we can conclude that erosion does not occur equally throughout the landscape but is focused upslope of headwater streams, along tributary channels, or on ridge tops. This is in contrast to some models which assume equal erosion in headwater basins. (C) 2011 University of Washington. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The Airborne Carbon in the Mountains Experiment was carried out in 2007 partly to assess carbon uptake in western U. S. mountain ecosystems. The magnitude and seasonal change of carbon uptake were quantified by (1) paired upwind-downwind airborne CO2 observations applied in a boundary layer budget, (2) a spatially explicit ecosystem model constrained using remote sensing and flux tower observations, and (3) a downscaled global tracer transport inversion. Top-down approaches had mean carbon uptake equivalent to flux tower observations at a subalpine forest, while the ecosystem model showed less. The techniques disagreed on temporal evolution. Regional carbon uptake was greatest in the early summer immediately following snowmelt and tended to lessen as the region experienced dry summer conditions. This reduction was more pronounced in the airborne budget and inversion than in flux tower or upscaling, possibly related to lower snow water availability in forests sampled by the aircraft, which were lower in elevation than the tower site.

Squamish River basin occupies 3600 km(2) of mountainous terrain in south-western British Columbia, about 50 km north of Vancouver. The magnitude, volume and duration of extreme floods (Q >= 1500 m(3)/s) exhibit respective temporal increases of 50, 450 and 300%. The increase in extreme floods is attributed to the intensification of late-season (August-December) Pacific storms that have produced increases in precipitation amounts, intensity and duration of respectively 340, 200 and 200% over the same period. Changes in floodplain-surface area calculated from the geographic information system (GIS) differencing of sequential large-scale aerial photographs indicate that the rate of geomorphic change in Squamish River has accelerated during the 1980s to the mid-1990s. Among four study reaches of varying planform, erosional, depositional and cumulative changes in floodplain surface-area have rapidly increased. Channel-change activity after 1980 has increased by a factor of two to six compared with the period prior to 1980. Erosion is currently outpacing deposition in the majority of study reaches. Although channel geometry generally exhibits no uniform pattern of response to the increase in extreme floods, the meandering reaches have straightened over the duration of the study period. The increase in the magnitude and duration of the annual flood appears to be the principal cause of this recent acceleration of channel change.

Fossil diatom assemblage and loss-on-ignition data were investigated from a similar to 13,000-year lake sediment core from the Uinta Mountains, northeastern Utah, USA. Results indicate the presence of three major zones of environmental change: 1) from similar to 12.9-10.9 cal ka, modern lake formation began, temperatures were cool, and water was turbid; 2) from similar to 10.9-3.5 cal ka conditions were warmer-than-present, and the lake stratified during the summer; and 3) beginning approximately 3.5 cal ka, temperatures decreased relative to the previous zone and the lake appears to have become increasingly alkaline. Shifts in diatom taxa relative abundances within the middle zone (ca. 8.2-6.5 and 5.0-3.5 cal ka) are probably caused by precipitation-driven decreases in alkalinity and increases in lake depth. This record reflects evolution of the lake system and suggests that currently rising temperatures will reduce ice cover and enhance lake stratification and internal nutrient cycling. Any future changes in precipitation patterns may also impact lake ecology through shifts in alkalinity and/or depth.

Sites of pika extirpation experienced higher summer temperatures and higher frequency of extremely warm days during 2005-2007 than did sites of pika persistence. Several aspects of vegetative cover also differed between persistence and extirpation sites, and relative forb cover was positively related to pika persistence. Evaluation of competing models within an information-theoretic framework suggests strong support for recent mean summer temperature as the primary driver of extirpations in this dataset. In agreement with other modeling efforts, this result supports the hypothesis that extirpation results from chronic heat stress during the summer months when pikas must gather and store food for the winter. In contrast with previous studies, we found less support for the hypothesis that extirpation results from acute cold stress during the winter months, possibly due to several differences in analytical methods.

Treatments to reduce wildfire severity can reduce emissions, but with an immediate cost of reducing carbon stocks. In this study we examine the tradeoffs in carbon stock reduction and wildfire emissions in 19 fuels-treated and -untreated forests burned in twelve wildfires. The fuels treatment, a commonly used thinning 'from below' and removal of activity fuels, removed an average of 50.3 Mg C ha(-1) or 34% of live tree carbon stocks. Wildfire emissions averaged 29.7 and 67.8 Mg C ha(-1) in fuels treated and untreated forests, respectively. The total carbon (fuels treatment plus wildfire emission) removed from treated sites was 119% of the carbon emitted from the untreated/burned sites. However, with only 3% tree survival following wildfire, untreated forests averaged only 7.8 Mg C ha(-1) in live trees with an average quadratic mean tree diameter of 21 cm. In contrast, treated forest averaged 100.5 Mg C ha(-1) with a live tree quadratic mean diameter of 44 cm. In untreated forests 70% of the remaining total ecosystem carbon shifted to decomposing stocks after the wildfire, compared to 19% in the fuels-treated forest. In wildfire burned forest, fuels treatments have a higher immediate carbon 'cost', but in the long-term may benefit from lower decomposition emissions and higher carbon storage.

In this paper, we present three case studies from the forests of British Columbia to illustrate the direct and indirect effects of climatic variation and global warming on forest composition and function. (1) Tree mortality rates in old forests of western North America have doubled in recent decades. Regional warming and water deficits directly affected tree death rates or indirectly increased insect and pathogen activity and wind storms causing tree deaths. Concurrently, tree density and basal area declined significantly, indicating lagged growth responses of surviving trees or long-term decline of these forests. (2) Yellow-cedar decline along coastal British Columbia and Alaska shows that small changes in average climatic conditions, coupled with extreme weather events, can have large ecological effects. A small persistent increase in mean temperatures has reduced snow-cover depth and duration. Coupled with extreme cold events which damage unprotected tree roots, these climatic changes are considered the primary cause of widespread yellow-cedar mortality. (3) Interactions between climate and disturbance are complex in the mountain forests of the East Kootenay region. Understanding historic climate-fire interactions is key to anticipating future frequent and severe fires. Here, climate change effects may be exacerbated by the cumulative effects of human land use, fire exclusion and mountain pine beetle outbreaks.

Restoration of pre-fire-suppression open-forest structure to reduce the risk of uncharacteristic stand-replacing fires is a guiding principle in forest management policy, but identifying which forests are clear candidates for restoration remains a challenge. We conducted dendroecological reconstructions of fire history and stand structure at 40 sites in the upper montane zone of the Colorado Front Range (2400-2800 m), sampled in proportion to the distribution of forest types in that zone (50% dominated by ponderosa pine, 28% by lodgepole pine, 12% by aspen, 10% by Douglas-fir). We characterized past fire severity based on remnant criteria at each site in order to assess the effect of fire history on tree establishment patterns, and we also evaluated the influence of fire suppression and climate. We found that 62% of the sites experienced predominantly moderate-severity fire, 38% burned at high severity, and no sites burned exclusively at low severity. The proportion of total tree and sapling establishment was significantly different among equal time periods based on a chi-square test, with highest tree and sapling establishment during the pre-fire-suppression period (1835-1919). Superposed epoch analysis revealed that fires burned during years of extreme drought (95% CI). The major pulse of tree establishment in the upper montane zone occurred during a multidecadal period of extreme drought conditions in the Colorado Front Range (1850-1889), during which 53% of the fires from the 1750-1989 period burned.

Quantitative models are frequently employed to tackle the complexities associated with disturbance processes. Here we review the wide variety of approaches to modelling natural disturbances in forest ecosystems, addressing the full spectrum of disturbance modelling from single events to integrated disturbance regimes. We applied a general, process-based framework founded in disturbance ecology to analyze modelling approaches for drought, wind, forest fires, insect pests and ungulate browsing. Modelling approaches were reviewed by disturbance agent and mechanism, and a set of general disturbance modelling concepts was deduced. We found that although the number of disturbance modelling approaches emerging over the last 15 years has increased strongly, statistical concepts for descriptive modelling are still largely prevalent over mechanistic concepts for explanatory and predictive applications. Yet, considering the increasing importance of disturbances for forest dynamics and ecosystem stewardship under anthropogenic climate change, the latter concepts are crucial tool for understanding and coping with change in forest ecosystems. Current challenges for disturbance modelling in forest ecosystems are thus (i) to overcome remaining limits in process understanding, (ii) to further a mechanistic foundation in disturbance modelling, (iii) to integrate multiple disturbance processes in dynamic ecosystem models for decision support in forest management, and (iv) to bring together scaling capabilities across several levels of organization with a representation of system complexity that captures the emergent behaviour of disturbance regimes.

Plankton in a high mountain lake was exposed in situ to increasing phosphorus (P) concentrations (mimicking atmospheric pulses) in absence or presence of UVR in order to identify their interactive effect on functional [primary production, organic carbon (C) release (EOC), and percentage of C released (%EOC)], growth rate, structural-physiological (algal biomass, sestonic C, P content, chlorophyll a (Chl a), and Chl a:C ratio, P cell quota, cell-specific Chl a), and stoichiometric (autotroph C: P ratio) traits. The availability of P after the pulse determined the intensity of responses by primary producers to UVR stress. All structural-physiological and functional variables significantly increased by up to two orders of magnitude in response to P enrichment. UV radiation, over a long-term scale, exerted significant deleterious effects on most structural-physiological variables when inorganic P was added at high levels (>= 30 mu g PL-1). The subsequent unexpected negative synergistic UVR x P effect on algal development did not support our initial hypothesis that P input might buffer the harmful UVR effect. UVR exerted a weak negative effect on primary production but strongly enhanced the absolute and percentage excretion of C (up to 60%), mechanism responsible of a significant reduction in autotroph C: P ratios. We propose that low sestonic C:P ratios are the outcome of an adaptive strategy of algae in environments with high UVR exposure and extreme nutrient limitation and have important implications for C flux through grazing vs. microbial food webs in oligotrophic systems.",2008,10.1111/j.1365-2486.2007.01496.x,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WOS:000253313400018,Meghan,No,Yes,No,,Sierra,NA,,,,,,Danny,No,Yes,No,Southern Spain,Meghan,No,Maybe,No,Sierra,

Here, we apply a combination of light detection and ranging (lidar) remote sensing (LVIS), an individual-based height-structured ecosystem model (ED), and detailed topographic and climate data to address these requirements to predict carbon dynamics at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF) in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. Lidar data provided substantial constraints on model estimates of carbon stocks and annual net ecosystem production (ANEP). Lidar-initialized model estimates of carbon stocks (10.77 kg C m(-2)) were within 5% of the field estimates over the domain and accounted for the 44% decrease in carbon stocks observed between minimum and maximum elevation at HBEF. Lidar-initialized model estimates of ANEP (0.023 kg C m(-2) year(-1)) also compared favorably with recent field estimates. Model estimates of ANEP strongly depended on fine-scale (1 ha) lidar data on vegetation structure, environmental gradients, and the dynamics of disturbance events. Substituting fine-scale (1 ha) data on vegetation structure and climate with domain-wide inputs increased model estimates of ANEP by 84%. Substituting fine-scale climate data with domain-wide inputs but initializing with fine-scale data on vegetation structure increased estimates of ANEP by 40%. Model simulations initialized with spatial heterogeneity in environmental conditions but that lacked corresponding spatial heterogeneity in vegetation structure were the most problematic because this configuration had serious inconsistencies in areas where the domain mean canopy height exceeded the local potential for vegetation (e. g., at high elevations). Lastly, failing to account for increased natural disturbance rates with elevation increased model estimates of ANEP by 43%. This research demonstrates that the combination of lidar data and a height-structured ecosystem model can be a powerful tool for estimating forest carbon stocks and fluxes, even in complex mountainous environments. To be most useful for constraining model predictions, lidar data need to be at the scale of the underlying environmental heterogeneity that determines plant vital rates.",2008,,Remote Sensing,WOS:000261858800011,Meghan,No,Yes,No,,New Hampshire,NA,,,,,,Courtney,No,,No,Hubbard Brooks,Meghan,No,Maybe,No,New Hampshire,

Although it is recognized that deadwood above treeline may have decayed, the absence of such wood is routinely taken to imply the absence of trees for periods ranging from the past few millennia to the entire Holocene. Reconstructed treeline histories are then explained in terms of such variables as slope, drainage, temperature, solar insolation, and precipitation. While these variables certainly help determine where deadwood is to be found above treeline today, we suggest that they cannot always explain where it is not to be found. In the alpine environments of the western United States, archeological work has established a human presence during nearly the entire Holocene in portions of the Rocky Mountains and for over 5000 radiocarbon years in the Great Basin and Sierra Nevada. We suggest that prehistoric occupations may have stripped deadwood from the landscape in all of these areas. To the extent that this is true, reconstructions of past treelines from deadwood may reflect the human prehistory of an area as much as it reflects treeline history itself. We encourage evaluation of this hypothesis in areas of active dendrochronological and archeological research. (c) 2008 Rubel Foundation, ETH Zurich. Published by Elsevier GmbH.

Using historical museum specimen records and recent field surveys, I examine temporal patterns in the ecological dynamics of the small mammal fauna on five mountain ranges in central Utah over time intervals of 2753 years during the past century. This landscape was heavily modified by livestock grazing early in the twentieth century and since then has witnessed a steady decline in grazing intensity. In general, at regional and landscape scales, species preferring mesic habitats increased in percent abundance, rank abundance, and rank occurrence over time. This result is opposite that predicted from regional climate trends and probably represents the recovery of forest conditions following a release over time from earlier periods of severe overgrazing. Decreased grazing intensity may thus mitigate the predicted biological effects of climatically driven environmental change for small mammals.

To account for the uncertainty in genealogical estimates, we adopted a coalescent approach for testing hypotheses of population divergence in coevolving taxa. We compared genealogies of a specialized herbivorous insect, Parnassius smintheus (Papilionidae), and its host plant, Sedum lanceolatum (Crassulaceae), from the alpine tundra of the Rocky Mountains to null distributions from coalescent simulations to test whether tightly associated taxa shared a common response to the paleoclimatic cycles. Explicit phylogeographic models were generated from geologic and biogeographic data and evaluated over a wide range of divergence times given calibrated mutation rates for both species.

The alpine treeline is a landscape feature that is coupled to climate and is expected to change location with changes in climate. In the Rocky Mountains, treeline environments are dominated by two distinct growth forms. Dwarf trees are stunted trees that retain an arboreal growth form and krummholz are trees that have assumed a mat-like growth form. Models of treeline dynamics have not taken into account these differences. In this study, I investigate the effects of canopy type on carbon balances predicted using ATE-BGC. ATE-BGC is a forest process model that has been developed specifically for treeline environments. The canopies of dwarf trees and krummholz differ with regard to the vertical distribution of leaf area index (LAI) and light within the canopies. The thermal regimes of the two canopy types also differ vertically. These differences within and between canopy types have significant effects on simulated carbon balance. Dwarf tree canopies are simulated to have higher carbon balances for all leaf area index values above 4 and carbon balances for both canopy types decrease with increases in LAI. The incorporation of vertical changes in the thermal regime does not have a significant impact on carbon balance for either canopy type. The results show that canopy type is an important factor to consider when modeling the alpine treeline. The results also suggest avenues for future modification to the ATE-BGC model. The inclusion of a mechanism to allow for a physiognomic switch (dwarf tree to krummholz or krummholz to dwarf tree) would benefit future simulations of treeline response to climate change.

These pressures modify groundwater levels and their temporal patterns and threaten vital ecosystem services such as arable land irrigation and ecosystem water requirements, especially during droughts. This review examines climate change effects on groundwater and dependent ecosystems. The mechanisms affecting natural variability in the global climate and the consequences of climate and land use changes due to anthropogenic influences are summarised based on studies from different hydrogeological strata and climate zones. The impacts on ecosystems are discussed based on current findings on factors influencing the biodiversity and functioning of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. The influence of changes to groundwater on GDE biodiversity and future threats posed by climate change is reviewed, using information mainly from surface water studies and knowledge of aquifer and groundwater ecosystems. Several gaps in research are identified. Due to lack of understanding of several key processes, the uncertainty associated with management techniques such as numerical modelling is high. The possibilities and roles of new methodologies such as indicators and modelling methods are discussed in the context of integrated groundwater resources management. Examples are provided of management impacts on groundwater, with recommendations on sustainable management of groundwater. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

C-14 age gradients below the water table suggest recharge rates of 1-2 mm/yr which correspond to a sustainable yield of 5 x 10(-4) km(3)/yr to 1 x 10(-3) km(3)/yr. Uncertainties in the applied effective porosity value and increasing horizontal interbasin flow components at greater depths may bias these estimates low compared to those previously reported using the water budget method. The deviation of the groundwater 8180 time-series pattern for the Pleistocene-Holocene transition from that of the Devils Hole vein calcite (which is considered a proxy for local climate change) allows interbasin flow rates of northerly derived groundwater to be estimated. The constrained rates (75.0-120 m/yr) are slightly higher than those previously calculated using Darcy's Law, but translate into hydraulic conductivity values strikingly similar to those obtained from pump tests. Data further indicate that production wells located closer to the western mountainous margin will be producing mainly from locally derived mountain-system recharge whereas wells located closer to the eastern margin are more influenced by older, regionally derived carbonate groundwater.

Pikas are declining within a large portion of their range, and ongoing research suggests loss of sub-surface ice as a mechanism. However, no studies have demonstrated physiological responses of pikas to sub-surface ice features. Here we present the first analysis of physiological stress in pikas living in and adjacent to habitats underlain by ice. Fresh fecal samples were collected non-invasively from two adjacent sites in the Rocky Mountains (one with sub-surface ice and one without) and analyzed for glucocorticoid metabolites (GCM). We also measured sub-surface microclimates in each habitat. Results indicate lower GCM concentration in sites with sub-surface ice, suggesting that pikas are less stressed in favorable microclimates resulting from sub-surface ice features. GCM response was well predicted by habitat characteristics associated with sub-surface ice features, such as lower mean summer temperatures. These results suggest that pikas inhabiting areas without sub-surface ice features are experiencing higher levels of physiological stress and may be more susceptible to changing climates. Although post-deposition environmental effects can confound analyses based on fecal GCM, we found no evidence for such effects in this study. Sub-surface ice features are key to water cycling and storage and will likely represent an increasingly important component of water resources in a warming climate. Fecal samples collected from additional watersheds as part of current pika monitoring programs could be used to further characterize relationships between pika stress and sub-surface ice features.",2015,10.1371/journal.pone.0119327,Science & Technology - Other Topics,WOS:000353889600023,Micah,No,Yes,No,,MT & CO; MT just outside CRB,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Meghan,No,Maybe,No,MT & CO; MT just outside CRB,

This mosaic in turn influences fuel accumulation and moisture and forest structure. We studied these the effects of varying environmental conditions across a 27,104 ha landscape within Yosemite National Park, California, USA, on the number of fires and burn severity (measured from Landsat data for 1984-2010) and on canopy cover at two heights (>2 m and 2-8 m) and dominant tree height (measured with airborne LiDAR data). We used site water balance (actual evapotranspiration and climatic water deficit) and topography (slope position, slope, and insolation) as environmental predictors. Random forest modeling showed that environmental conditions predicted substantial portions of the variations in fire and forest structure: e.g., 85-93% of the variation in whether a location did not burn, burned once, or burned twice; 64% of the variation in the burn severity; and 72% of the variation in canopy cover >2 m for unburned forests, 64% for once-burned forests, and 59% for twice-burned forests. Environmental conditions also predicted a substantial portion of forest structure following one and two fires, even though the post-fire forest structures were substantially different than pre-fire structures. This suggests a feedback mechanism in which local fire regimes and pre-fire forest structures are related to local environments, and their interaction produces post-fire structures also related to local environments. Among environmental predictors, water balance had the greatest explanatory power, followed by slope position, and then by slope and insolation. Managers could use our methods to help select reference areas that match environmental conditions, identify areas at risk for fires that endanger critical habitat or other resources, and identify climate analog areas to help anticipate and plan for climate change.

Increased fire activity on USFS lands was correlated with warmer and drier springs. Although this is consistent with recent global warming, we found an equally strong relationship between fire activity and climate in the first half of the 20th century. At lower elevations, warmer and drier conditions were not strongly tied to fire activity over the last 90 years, although prior-year precipitation was significant. It is hypothesised that the fire-climate relationship in forests is determined by climatic effects on spring and summer fuel moisture, with hotter and drier springs leading to a longer fire season and more extensive burning. In contrast, future fire activity in the foothills may be more dependent on rainfall patterns and their effect on the herbaceous fuel load. We predict spring and summer warming will have a significant impact on future fire regimes, primarily in higher-elevation forests.

We explored the value of radiocarbon dating of fecal pellets to address questions of population persistence and timing of site extirpation. Carbon was extracted from pellets collected at 43 locations in the western Great Basin, USA, including three known occupied sites and 40 sites of uncertain status at range margins or where previous studies indicated the species is vulnerable. We resolved calibrated dates with high precision (within several years), most of which fell in the period of the mid-late 20th century bomb curve. The two-sided nature of the bomb curve renders far- and near-side dates of equal probability, which are separated by one to four decades. We document methods for narrowing resolution to one age range, including stratigraphic analysis of vegetation collected from pika haypiles. No evidence was found for biases in atmospheric C-14 levels due to fossil-derived or industrial CO2 contamination. Radiocarbon dating indicated that pellets can persist for >59 years; known occupied sites resolved contemporary dates. Using combined evidence from field observations and radiocarbon dating, and the Bodie Mountains as an example, we propose a historical biogeographic scenario for pikas in minor Great Basin mountain ranges adjacent to major cordillera, wherein historical climate variability led to cycles of extirpation and recolonization during alternating cool and warm centuries. Using this model to inform future dynamics for small ranges in biogeographic settings similar to the Bodie Mountains in California, extirpation of pikas appears highly likely under directional warming trends projected for the next century, even while populations in extensive cordillera (e.g., Sierra Nevada, Rocky Mountains, Cascade Range) are likely to remain viable due to extensive, diverse habitat and high connectivity.",2014,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WOS:000342859800014,Micah,No,Maybe,No,,Great Basin,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Meghan,No,Maybe,No,Great Basin,

S. have contributed to a perception that fire exclusion has caused an unprecedented occurrence of uncharacteristically severe fires, particularly in lower elevation dry pine forests. In the absence of long-term fire severity records, it is unknown how short-term trends compare to fire severity prior to 20th century fire exclusion. This study compares historical (i.e. pre-1920) fire severity with observed modern fire severity and modeled potential fire behavior across 564,413 ha of montane forests of the Colorado Front Range. We used forest structure and tree-ring fire history to characterize fire severity at 232 sites and then modeled historical fire-severity across the entire study area using biophysical variables. Eighteen (7.8%) sites were characterized by low-severity fires and 214 (92.2%) by mixed-severity fires (i.e. including moderate-or high-severity fires). Difference in area of historical versus observed low-severity fire within nine recent (post-1999) large fire perimeters was greatest in lower montane forests. Only 16% of the study area recorded a shift from historical low severity to a higher potential for crown fire today. An historical fire regime of more frequent and low-severity fires at low elevations (<2260 m) supports a convergence of management goals of ecological restoration and fire hazard mitigation in those habitats. In contrast, at higher elevations mixed-severity fires were predominant historically and continue to be so today. Thinning treatments at higher elevations of the montane zone will not return the fire regime to an historic low-severity regime, and are of questionable effectiveness in preventing severe wildfires. Based on present-day fuels, predicted fire behavior under extreme fire weather continues to indicate a mixed-severity fire regime throughout most of the montane forest zone.

In California's Sierra Nevada mountains, low flows are primarily sustained by groundwater that is recharged during snowmelt. As the climate warms over the next century, the volume of the annual Sierra Nevada snowpack is expected to decrease by similar to 40-90%. In eight snow-dominated catchments in the Sierra Nevada, we analysed records of snow water equivalent (SWE) and unimpaired streamflow records spanning 10-33 years. Linear extrapolations of historical SWE/streamflow relationships suggest that annual minimum flows in some catchments could decrease to zero if peak SWE is reduced to roughly half of its historical average. For every 10% decrease in peak SWE, annual minimum flows decrease 9-22% and occur 3-7 days earlier in the year. In two of the study catchments, Sagehen and Pitman Creeks, seasonal low flows are significantly correlated with the previous year's snowpack as well as the current year's snowpack. We explore how future warming could affect the relationship between winter snowpacks and summer low flows, using a distributed hydrologic model Regional Hydro-ecologic Ecosystem Simulation System (RHESSys) to simulate the response of two study catchments. Model results suggest that a 10% decrease in peak SWE will lead to a 1-8% decrease in low flows. The modelled streams do not dry up completely, because the effects of reduced SWE are partly offset by increased fall or winter net gains in storage, and by shifts in the timing of peak evapotranspiration. We consider how groundwater storage, snowmelt and evapotranspiration rates, and precipitation phase (snow vs rain) influence catchment response to warming.

Predicted hydrologic change associated with climate change will likely challenge the ability of specific stocks to adapt to new flow regimes and resulting shifts in spawning and rearing habitats. Current research suggests egg-to-fry survival may be one of the most important freshwater limiting factors in Pacific Salmon's northern range due to more frequent flooding events predicted to scour eggs from mobile spawning substrates. A watershed-scale hydroclimatic sensitivity index was developed to map this hypothesis with an historical stream gauge station dataset and monthly multiple regression-based discharge models. The relative change from present to future watershed conditions predicted for the spawning and incubation period (September to March) was quantified using an ensemble global climate model average (ECHAM5, HadCM3, and CGCM3.1) and three global greenhouse gas emission scenarios (B1, A1B, and A2) projected to the year 2080. The models showed the region's diverse physiography and climatology resulted in a relatively predictable pattern of change: northern mainland and steeper, snow-fed mountainous watersheds exhibited the greatest increases in discharge, an earlier spring melt, and a transition into rain-fed hydrologic patterns. Predicted streamflow increases for all watersheds ranged from approximately 1-fold to 3-fold for the spawning and incubation period, with increased peak flows in the spring and fall. The hydroclimatic sensitivity index was then combined with an index of currently mapped salmon habitat and species diversity to develop a research and conservation priority matrix, highlighting potentially vulnerable to resilient high-value watersheds. The resulting matrix and observed trends are put forth as a framework to prioritize long-term monitoring plans, mitigation experiments, and finer-scale climate impact and adaptation studies.",NA,,,,Micah,No,Yes,No,,AK,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Meghan,No,Maybe,No,AK,

The timing and magnitude of streamflow in a snowpack-dominated drainage basin such as the Nooksack River basin are strongly influenced by temperature and precipitation. Projections of future climate made by general circulation models (GCMs) indicate increases in temperature and variable changes in precipitation for the Nooksack River basin. Understanding the response of the river to climate change is crucial for regional water resources planning because municipalities, tribes, and industry depend on the river for water use and for fish habitat. We combine three different climate scenarios downscaled from GCMs and the Distributed-Hydrology-Soil-Vegetation Model to simulate future changes to timing and magnitude of streamflow in the higher elevations of the Nooksack River. Simulations of future streamflow and snowpack in the basin project a range of magnitudes, which reflects the variable meteorological changes indicated by the three GCM scenarios and the local natural variability employed in the modeling. Simulation results project increased winter flows, decreased summer flows, decreased snowpack, and a shift in timing of the spring melt peak and maximum snow water equivalent. These results are consistent with previous regional studies, but the magnitude of increased winter flows and total annual runoff is higher. Increases in temperature dominate snowpack declines and changes to spring and summer streamflow, whereas a combination of increases in temperature and precipitation control increased winter streamflow.

We studied the phylogeographic history of the Arboreal Salamander (Aneides lugubris), a wide-ranging species endemic to the California floristic province. We used multi-locus data to reconstruct the evolutionary history of A. lugubris and to discover the geographic location of major genetic breaks within the species. We also used species distribution modeling and comparative phylogeography to better understand the environmental factors that have shaped the genetic history of A. lugubris. Results: We found six major mitochondrial clades in A. lugubris. Nuclear loci supported the existence of at least three genetically distinct groups, corresponding to populations north of the San Francisco Bay and in the Sierra Nevada, in the Santa Cruz Mountains, and in the central coast and southern California. All of the genetic breaks in mitochondrial and nuclear loci corresponded to regions where historical barriers to dispersal have been observed in other species. Geologic or water barriers likely were the most important factors restricting gene flow among clades. Climatic unsuitability during glacial maximum may have contributed to the isolation of the mitochondrial clades in the central coast and southern California. A projection of our species distribution model to a future scenario with a moderate amount of climate change suggests that most of the range of A. lugubris will remain climatically suitable, but climatic conditions in the Sierra Nevada and low elevation areas in Southern California are likely to deteriorate. Conclusions: Aneides lugubris contains substantial cryptic genetic diversity as a result of historical isolation of populations. At least two (and perhaps three) evolutionarily significant units in A. lugubris merit protection; all six mitochondrial clades should be considered as management units within the species.",NA,,,,Paris,No,Yes,No,,CA,Micah,No,Yes,No,,CA,NA,,,,,Meghan,No,Maybe,No,CA,

Here we investigated the cold tolerance of the leaf beetle Chrysomela aeneicollis living at high elevation in California's Sierra Nevada mountains. These insects spend over half their life cycle overwintering, and may therefore be vulnerable to winter cold, and prior studies have demonstrated that survival is reduced by exposure to summertime cold. We identify overwintering microhabitat of this insect, describe cold tolerance strategies in all life stages, and use microclimate data to determine the importance of snow cover and microhabitat buffering for overwinter survival. Cold tolerance varies among life history stages and is typically correlated with microhabitat temperature: cold hardiness is lowest in chill-susceptible larvae, and highest in freeze-tolerant adults. Hemolymph osmolality is higher in quiescent (overwintering) than summer adults, primarily, but not exclusively, due to elevated hemolymph glycerol. In nature, adult beetles overwinter primarily in leaf litter and suffer high mortality if early, unseasonable cold prevents them from entering this refuge. These data suggest that cold tolerance is tightly linked to life stage. Thus, population persistence of montane insects may become problematic as climate becomes more unpredictable and climate change uncouples the phenology of cold tolerance and development from the timing of extreme cold events.

These landscapes are undergoing rapid changes from the combined effects of forest fires, insect infestation and climate change. Numerous observational studies demonstrate that trees control snowpack accumulation and ablation over scales of tens of metres. Representing forest heterogeneity in models is important for understanding how changes in climate and vegetation cover affect the snowpack; yet, many snow models simplify a forest into two categories: canopy covered and non-canopy covered. We combine existing parameterizations of mass and energy fluxes within a new three-dimensional framework informed by Airborne Laser Swath Mapping (ALSM)-derived canopy maps and evaluated with ALSM-derived snow depth maps to explicitly simulate snow cover in relation to heterogeneous canopy. Model results capture much of the observed snow variability depicted in the 1-m ALSM-derived snow depth maps. Observations and modelled results identify open areas <15 m from tree canopies as having more snow and more snow variability than areas >15 m from tree canopies, and modelled results predict that open areas <15 m from tree canopies have 30-40% more net snow water input than areas that are underneath tree canopies and 10-25% more net snow water input than areas that are >15 m from tree canopies. Furthermore, 1-m simulations give higher estimates for net snow water input than coarser resolution simulations, mainly in areas with fewer trees. These results suggest the importance of explicitly representing canopy edges in snow models.

This study focused on streamflow variability downstream of Bridge Glacier in the southern Coast Mountains of BC between 1979 and 2014, prior to and during a period in which the glacier experienced enhanced calving and rapid retreat across a lake-filled basin. Here we combined empirical trend detection and a conceptual-parametric hydrological model to address the following hypotheses: (1) streamflow trends in late summer and early autumn should reflect the opposing influences of climatic warming (which would tend to increase unit-area meltwater production) and the reduction in glacier area (which would tend to reduce the total volume of meltwater generated), and (2) winter streamflow should increase because of displacement of lake water as ice flows past the grounding line and calves into the lake basin. In relation to the first hypothesis, we found no significant trends in monthly discharge during summer. However, applying regression analysis to account for air temperature and precipitation variations, weak but statistically significant negative trends were detected for August and melt season discharge. The HBV-EC model was applied using time-varying glacier cover, as derived from Landsat imagery. Relative to simulations based on constant glacier extent, model results indicated that glacier recession caused a decline in mean monthly streamflow of 9% in August and 11% in September. These declines in late-summer streamflow are consistent with the results from our empirical analysis. The second hypothesis is supported by the finding of positive trends for December, January, and February discharge. Despite the modelled declines in late-summer mean monthly streamflow, recorded discharge data exhibited neither positive nor negative trends during the melt season, suggesting that Bridge Glacier may currently be at or close to the point of peak water. Further analysis of the impact of lake-terminating glaciers on downstream discharge is needed to refine the peak water model.

The most extensive and intensive stress and mortality are received from human activity, fire, and mountain pine beetles (MPB; Dendroctonus ponderosae). Understanding disturbance interactions and disturbance-succession pathways are crucial for adapting management strategies to mitigate their impacts and anticipate future ecosystem change. Driven by this goal, we assessed the forest disturbance and recovery history in the Southern Rocky Mountains Ecoregion using a 13-year time series of Landsat image stacks. An automated classification workflow that integrates temporal segmentation techniques and a random forest classifier was used to examine disturbance patterns. To enhance efficiency in selecting representative samples at the ecoregion scale, a new sampling strategy that takes advantage of the scene-overlap among adjacent Landsat images was designed. The segment-based assessment revealed that the overall accuracy for all 14 scenes varied from 73.6% to 92.5%, with a mean of 83.1%. A design-based inference indicated the average producer's and user's accuracies for MPB mortality were 85.4% and 82.5% respectively. We found that burn severity was largely unrelated to the severity of pre-fire beetle outbreaks in this region, where the severity of post-fire beetle outbreaks generally decreased in relation to burn severity. Approximately half the clear-cut and burned areas were in various stages of recovery, but the regeneration rate was much slower for MPB-disturbed sites. Pre-fire beetle outbreaks and subsequent fire produced positive compound effects on seedling reestablishment in this ecoregion. Taken together, these results emphasize that although multiple disturbances do play a role in the resilience mechanism of the serotinous lodgepole pine, the overall recovery could be slow due to the vast area of beetle mortality.

Rates of degradation through time control landform stability and resiliency. Therefore, records of past degradation rates can be used to inform us on how a given landscape responded to significant changes in past climates. For example, climate has varied at many temporal scales, and some of the largest recent shifts enabled the glacial advances and retreats in time scales of 20-100 ka. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that the rate of landscape degradation has also varied at similar time scales. However, the general hill slope diffusion equation that is commonly used to model cross-profiles of hillslopes on time scales of thousands to tens of thousands of years typically relies on a constant and optimized rate parameter to generate a model cross-profile approximating the current observed landform cross-profile. Using a time-varying diffusivity parameter, we generated three separate degradation scenarios for the Mono Basin moraine in the eastern Sierra Nevada, CA, USA, in order to assess the potential impact of varying past climates on sediment transport. We used published paleoclimate records in the study area and modern rates of surface degradation from climates that correspond broadly to those paleoclimates. The results indicate that, in this case, the climate driven and, therefore, time-dependent degradation model produces a good fit between the modeled and observed landform profiles. Results showed that, when the surface elevations of the reference case (constant optimized diffusivity) were compared through time to the surface elevations of the time-dependent model, the differences were relatively small. The largest deviation was found to occur during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). We found that for investigations into the geological effects of climate change in glacial and polar regions, the use of time-varying diffusivity offers improved estimates of landform degradation through time. The rates of surface lowering that change through time are important for analyses of the depths of past exposures, exposure dating, and renewal or preservation of surfaces, all of which are relevant in landscape dating, in interpretation of paleoecology, and in modeling landscape evolution.

Such species are ideal for testing how neutral demographic factors and climate-driven selection structure genetic variation within species, and how this genetic variation can affect ecological communities. Here, we quantified genetic variation in vegetative phenology and growth traits in narrowleaf cottonwood, Populus angustifolia, using three common gardens planted with genotypes originating from source populations spanning the species' range along the Rocky Mountains of North America (ca. 1700 km). We present three main findings. First, we found strong evidence of divergent selection (Q(ST) > F-ST) on fall phenology (bud set) with adaptive consequences for frost avoidance. We also found evidence for selection on bud flush duration, tree height, and basal diameter, resulting in population differentiation. Second, we found strong associations with climate variables that were strongly correlated with latitude of origin. More strongly differentiated traits also showed stronger climate correlations, which emphasizes the role that climate has played in divergent selection throughout the range. We found population 9 garden interaction effects; for some traits, this accounted for more of the variance than either factor alone. Tree height was influenced by the difference in climate of the source and garden locations and declined with increasing transfer distance. Third, growth traits were correlated with dependent arthropod community diversity metrics. Synthesis. Overall, we conclude that climate has influenced genetic variation and structure in phenology and growth traits and leads to local adaptation in P. angustifolia, which can then impact dependent arthropod species. Importantly, relocation of genotypes far northward or southward often resulted in poor growth, likely due to a phenological mismatch with photoperiod, the proximate cue for fall growth cessation. Genotypes moved too far southward suffer from early growth cessation, whereas those moved too far northward are prone to fall frost and winter dieback. In the face of current and forecasted climate change, habitat restoration, forestry, and tree breeding efforts should utilize these findings to better match latitudinal and climatic source environments with management locations for optimal future outcomes.",2016,10.1002/ece3.2222,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology,WOS:000379344400027,Paris,Yes,Yes,Yes,plot/family/group,,Danny,No,Yes,No,Lanscape/State-province,"Lethbridge, Others",NA,,,,,Meghan,No,Maybe,No,"range of tree is in, but sites are not",

In Washington, the most glaciated state in the contiguous United States, relatively little is known about the effect of loss of glacial water sources on macroinvertebrate communities. Our study compares the water quality conditions and composition of benthic macroinvertebrates from five rhithral (snowmelt-fed) and five kryal (glacially-fed) lake outlet streams in the North Cascade Mountains, WA. Kryal streams were characterized by lower water temperatures, higher discharge rates, higher turbidities, and less stable in-stream channels compared to rhithral sites. A total of 24 985 specimens representing 96 macroinvertebrate taxa were collected. Rhithral lake outlet streams had significantly higher densities and supported more taxa than kryal sites (9049 individuals m(-2) and 82 taxa versus 821 individuals m-2 and 38 taxa). Chironomidae dominated macroinvertebrate populations at all sites, although densities and taxa richness were significantly lower in kryal sites. Rhithral sites contained higher densities of non-insect taxa such as Acari, Oligochaeta, Nemathelminthes, Planariidae, and crustaceans. Kryal sites were dominated by cold stenotherm or cool eurythermal taxa and supported glacial-tolerant taxa such as chironomids Diamesa and Parorthocladuis, and the mayfly Rhithrogena. Water temperature, stream discharge, and turbidity were most strongly correlated to macroinvertebrate density and taxa richness.

In the California flora, relatively little attention has been given to the evolutionary history of paleoendemics from a molecular perspective, yet they number among some of the world's most iconic plant species. Here, we address questions of demographic change in Sequoiadendron giganteum (giant sequoia) that is restricted to a narrow belt of groves in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. We ask whether the current distribution is a result of northward colonization since the last glacial maximum (LGM), restriction of a broader range in the recent past (LGM) or independent colonizations in the deeper past. Genetic diversity at eleven microsatellite loci decreased with increasing latitude, but partial regressions suggested this was a function of smaller population sizes in the north. Disjunct populations north of the Kings River were divergent from those south of the Kings River that formed a single cluster in Bayesian assignment tests. Demographic inferences supported a demographic contraction just prior to the LGM as the most likely scenario for the current disjunct range of the species. This contraction appeared to be superimposed upon a long-term decline in giant sequoia over the last 2 million years, associated with increasing aridity due to the Mediterranean climate. Overall, low genetic diversity, together with competition in an environment to which giant sequoia is likely already poorly adapted, will pose major constraints on its success in the face of increasing aridity.",2016,10.1002/ece3.2122,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology,WOS:000376646700025,Paris,No,,No,,CA,NA,,,,,,Micah,No,Maybe,No,CA,Meghan,No,Maybe,No,CA,

Location Field research was conducted in the Toquima Range and Shoshone Mountains, Lander and Nye counties, Nevada, USA. Methods We obtained data for 49 sites in the Toquima Range from 1996 to 2002 and 39 sites in the Shoshone Mountains from 2000 to 2002. Sites spanned the gradient of local topographic and climatic conditions in those mountain ranges. Data on species composition and species richness were based on comprehensive field inventories. We calculated similarity of species composition using the Jaccard index. We conducted one-factor repeated-measures analyses of variance to test whether the distribution of similarity of species composition and the distribution of mean species richness depended on the number of years between inventories. Results In both mountain ranges, much less of the difference in species composition was attributable to turnover of species composition within sites over time than to spatial differences among sites. Annual species richness in the Toquima Range was more variable than in the Shoshone Mountains, but again far less of the variation in species richness was attributable to year than to differences among sites.

We have tested this hypothesis through a systematic investigation of neighbouring glaciated and nonglaciated drainage basins on the eastern side of the Sierra Nevada, CA. We present a simple, objective method for investigating the relief structure of a drainage basin, which shows noticeable differences in the spatial distribution of relief between nonglaciated and glaciated basins. Glaciated basins on the eastern side of the Sierra Nevada have only similar to 80 in greater mean geophysical relief than nonglaciated basins, This ""extra"" relief, though, is attributable principally to the larger size of the glaciated basins, as geophysical relief generally increases with basin size. The glaciers on this side of the range were only responsible for relief production if they substantially increased headward erosion rates into low relief topography, such as an elevated plateau., and thus enlarged previously fluvial basins. We carried out a preliminary morphometric analysis to elucidate the importance of this effect and found that the glaciers of the eastern Sierra Nevada may have eroded headward at considerably faster rates than rivers, but only when they were not obstructed from doing so by either competing larger glaciers in adjacent valleys or transfluent ice at the head of the basin. Our results also suggest that, in temperate regions, alpine glaciers are capable of eroding downward at faster rates than rivers above the equilibrium line altitude (ELA). Although we can rule out significant peak uplift in response to local relief production, in the special case of the Sierra Nevada the concentration of mass removal above the ELA could have contributed to flexural uplift at the edge of a tilting block.

We found good agreement (r(2) = 0.84) between mean PAI values of forest productivity for the six forest types with those obtained from field surveys. With confidence at this broader level of integration, we then ran model simulations to evaluate the constraints imposed by (i) soil fertility under current climatic conditions, (ii) the effect of doubling monthly precipitation across the region, and (iii) a widely used climatic change scenario that involves modifications in monthly mean temperatures and precipitation, as well as a doubling in atmospheric CO2 concentrations. These analyses showed that optimum soil fertility would more than double growth, with the greatest response in the subalpine type and the least increase in the coastal rain forests. Doubling the precipitation increased productivity in the pine type (> 50%) with reduced responses elsewhere. The climate change scenario with doubled atmospheric CO2 increased growth by 50% on average across all forest types, primarily as a result of a projected 33% increase in photosynthetic capacity. This modelling exercise indicates that, at a regional scale, a general relationship exists between simulated maximum leaf area index and maximum aboveground growth, supporting the contention that satellite-derived estimates of leaf area index may be good measures of the potential productivity of temperate evergreen forests.",2001,10.1046/j.1365-2486.2001.00385.x,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WOS:000167235600002,Shana,No,Yes,No,,SW OR,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Meghan,No,Maybe,No,SW OR,

We obtained diurnal measurements of leaf gas exchange and xylem water potential (Psi) from plants at a low and a high altitude site within each of six mountain ranges during fall 1994, spring, summer, and fall 1995, and summer 1996, We also determined carbon isotope composition (delta(13)C) of leaf cellulose produced during the 1995 growing season. Overall, leaf gas exchange, Psi and delta(13)C did not differ significantly between species. Differences in daily (A(d)) and season-long (A(s)) carbon assimilation among mountain ranges suggested two groupings-a group of northern ranges and a group of southern ranges. Each group contained one mountain range with J. occidentalis and two with J. osteosperma. Differences in carbon assimilation based on this grouping were associated with two findings: (1) conductance of CO2 from substomatal cavities to the site of carboxylation (g(m)) for junipers in the northern ranges averaged almost twice that of junipers in the southern ranges; and (2) physiological shifts occurred such that A(d) of junipers in the northern ranges was influenced more by Psi(pd), whereas A(d) of junipers in the southern ranges was influenced more by leaf temperature. Mean delta(13)C over all trees at a site was significantly correlated with annual precipitation. Significant differences in A(d) occurred between altitudes, but these differences were associated with differences in the timing of optimum leaf temperature for photosynthesis rather than with physiological acclimation to temperature, irradiance, or Psi. Most gas exchange parameters (e,g., assimilation, transpiration, stomatal conductance, and water use efficiency) varied seasonally, and the seasonal differences were strongly influenced by water stress.",1999,,Forestry,WOS:000080364900002,Shana,No,Yes,No,,"Great Basin, ID and UT

Alternatively, these plants represent populations that became established because of independent chance dispersal events. Location This study focuses on the area east of the Rocky Mountain Continental Divide in the Province of Alberta and the State of Montana in western Canada and USA, respectively. Methods Disjunct species were identified and their distributions mapped based on a review of occurrence maps and records, botanical floras and checklists, herbaria specimens, ecological and botanical studies, and field surveys of selected species. A disjunct species was defined as a plant population separated from its next nearest occurrence by a distance of > 300 km. Evaluation of the hypothesis was based on a review of published and unpublished pollen stratigraphy and palaeoecological studies. The potential geographical distribution of Hypsithermal vegetation was based on modern regional-based ecosystem mapping and associated monthly temperature summaries as well as future climatic warming models. Results The hypothesis was compatible with Holocene pollen stratigraphy, Hypsithermal permafrost and fen occurrence, and palaeosol phytolith analyses; and future global climatic warming models. Modelled regional Hypsithermal vegetation based on a 1degreesC increase in July temperatures relative to current conditions, indicated that much of the boreal forest zone in Alberta could have been grassland, which would explain the occurrence of Prairie species in the Peace River District. This amount of latitudinal vegetation shift (6.5degrees) was similar to an earlier Hypsithermal permafrost zone location study. An equivalent shift in vegetation along the eastern Cordillera would have placed south-western Montana-like vegetation and species such as Boykinia heucheriformis (Rydb.) Rosend. and Saxifraga odontoloma Piper within the northern half of the Rocky Mountains and foothills in Alberta, which represents the location of modern-day disjunct populations of these species. Main conclusions Warmer and drier climatic conditions during the Holocene Hypsithermal resulted in the northward displacement of vegetation zones relative to their current distribution patterns. Most of Alberta was probably dominated by grasslands during this period, except the Rocky Mountains and northern highlands. Modern-day species disjunctions within the Rocky Mountains and Peace River District as well as more northerly areas such as the Yukon Territory occurred when the vegetation receded southward in response to climatic cooling after the Hypsithermal. Wind dispersal was considered an unlikely possibility to explain the occurrence of the disjunct species, as most of the plants lack morphological adaptations for long distance transport and the prevailing winds were from west to east rather than south to north. However, consumption and transport of seeds by northward migrating birds could not be excluded as a possibility.",2003,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Physical Geography,WOS:000181739300009,Shana,Maybe,Yes,Yes,Landscape/State-Province,Rocky Mtn Divide--I'd include,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Meghan,No,Maybe,No,Alberta,

Upon deglaciation (ca. 11500 BP), Skinny Lake became an embayment of an ice-dammed lake. High elastic sedimentation rates, an unstable landscape, and cool, possibly wet conditions likely persisted until the early Holocene (ca. 9000 BP). From ca. 9000-8300 BP declining lake levels coupled with warm and dry conditions resulted in the formation of a prominent marl bed. A colonizing shrub and herb assemblage persisted from 9000 BP until about 8300 BP when it was replaced by a spruce (Picea) and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) forest under slightly cooler and moister conditions. The middle Holocene was warmer-than-present, however, decreasing temperature and increasing precipitation trends characterize the period from ca. 6000 BP-3000 BP. The transition to modern climate at 3000 BP is evident primarily in the lithostratigraphic record and corresponds with the initiation of the Tiedemann glacial advance (ca. 3300 BP) in the south-coastal mountains of British Columbia. A significant change in fossil pollen occurs at ca. 2400 BP and is characterised by an increase in pine pollen accompanied by decreases in alder (Alnus), spruce and fir. This also coincides with an increase in west-sourced exotic western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) and cedar type (Cupressaceae) pollen possibly transported by regional changes in air mass circulation patterns associated with Aleutian Low dynamics. This study demonstrates that both lithostratigraphic and biotic proxies are helpful in reconstructing the timing and nature of climate change and that each may have varying sensitivities to a particular type of change.",2002,10.1023/A:1021689328179,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,WOS:000179882600003,Shana,No,Yes,No,,"Skinny Lake, BC",NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Meghan,No,Maybe,No,western BC,

Since 1993 the National Park Service (NPS) has monitored the mass balance of four glaciers, and the NCGCP an additional two glaciers. This 14 glacier monitoring network, covering an area of 14000 km(2), represents the most extensive network of mass balance measurements for alpine glaciated areas in the world. The breadth of the record allows determination of the annual variability of annual balance from glacier to glacier, and from year to year. Data indicate a broad regional continuity in the response of these glaciers to climate. All cross-correlation values between any pair of the 14 glaciers ranged from 0.80 to 0.98. This strong degree of correlation indicates that regional-scale climate conditions, not local microclimates, are the primary control of glacier annual balance in the North Cascades. Data also indicate that the annual mass balance trend for glaciers was strongly negative from 1984 to 1994 and slightly positive from 1995 to 2000. The cumulative annual mass balance for eight glaciers between 1984 and 1994 was -0.39 m year(-1). From 1995 to 2000 the cumulative annual mass balance of the same eight glaciers was +0-10 m year(-1), and +0-15 m year(-1) for all 14 glaciers in this study. The correlation coefficients indicate the strongly similar response, not that the specific magnitude of the annual mass balance for each glacier is the same. There is a significant annual range in the individual glacier balances, averaging 1.01 m, and in the mean annual mass balance between glaciers. All of the glaciers with more positive annual mass balances since 1995 had either significant accumulation areas extending above 2300 m, and/or are east of the zone of maximum precipitation. The glaciers with the most negative annual mass balance are those with the lowest mean elevation. The record is, as yet, too short to explain the variability of mass balance fully using climate data and seasonal mass balance data.

During this period increases in winter temperatures have been more than twice as large as those during spring and summer. Glacier cover has decreased by at least 25% during the 20th century and glacier fronts have receded to positions last occupied ca. 3000 years ago. These two lines of evidence suggest that the climate of the late 20th century is exceptional in the context of the last 1000 to 3000 years. Detailed studies in three closely located upper treeline sites document variable responses of vegetation to climate change that reflect species differences as well as local differences in microclimate and site conditions. Treeline has advanced upslope in response to climate warming, but site and species differences control the rate and nature of the advance. Human impacts on the environment compound the changes due to climate warming. Historic photographs indicate significant changes in the type and density of forest cover due to the absence of significant forest fires within these National Parks during the last 70-80 years. The visual impact of these changes, which partially reflects a policy of fire suppression, is far greater than the impact of changes associated with more direct tourist-related impacts.

The Provo shoreline of Lake Bonneville formed following the Bonneville flood, and, based on previous dating, was formed during a period of overflow from about 17.5 to 15.0 cal. ka. In many places the Provo shoreline consists of a pair of distinct shorelines, one approximate to 3m higher than the other. We present data from two cuts through double beaches to show that the upper beach is younger and represents sedimentation after a lake-level rise. In addition, the lower beach deposits are internally stratified by beds that suggest three more lake-level rises during its development. The Provo beach complex thus appears to have been built during rising lake levels, which can be explained by rises in the overflow threshold by sequential landslide deposition. Evaluation of beach altitudes demonstrates that the two beach crests throughout the Bonneville basin experienced equivalent rebound from removal of the lake load, and therefore they formed after the rebound associated with the Bonneville flood occurred in early Provo time. However, radiocarbon ages on gastropods collected within the beach deposits suggest both that the sequence of five beach deposits formed from c.18.1 to c.17.0 cal. ka, and that the Bonneville flood occurred before 18 cal. ka. These ages are discordant with previous dates on shells within offshore sands, and raise questions about the validity of radiocarbon ages for shells in Lake Bonneville as well as about the age of the Bonneville flood and Provo shoreline.

High-resolution sampling and abundant macrofossils made it possible to analyze relationships between fire and vegetation. During the early Holocene (>10,500 to ca. 8000 cal yr BP) forests were subalpine woodlands dominated by Pinus contorta. Around 8000 cal yr BP, P. contorta sharply declined in the macrofossil record. Shade tolerant, mesic species first appeared ca. 4500 cal yr BP. Cupressus nootkatensis appeared most recently at 2000 cal yr BP. Fire frequency varies throughout the record, with significantly shorter mean fire return intervals in the early Holocene than the mid and late Holocene, Charcoal peaks are significantly correlated with an initial increase in macrofossil accumulation rates followed by a decrease, likely corresponding to tree mortality following fire. Climate appears to be a key driver in vegetation and fire regimes over millennial time scales. Fire and other disturbances altered forest vegetation at shorter time scales, and vegetation may have mediated local fire regimes. For example, dominance of P. contorta in the early Holocene forests may have been reinforced by its Susceptibility to frequent, stand-replacing fire events. (C) 2009 University of Washington.

Methods We analysed complete cytochrome b gene (1143 bp) sequences from 182 specimens of N. cinerea using Bayesian and coalescent methods to infer phylogenetic relationships, time of major divergences, and recent demographic trends. For comparison, we developed clade-specific ecological niche models for groups of interest and analysed spatial trends of N. cinerea in the palaeorecord as well as temporal frequency trends across strata of individual palaeomiddens. Results We found two largely allopatric clades within N. cinerea, with several regionally distinct subclades showing contrasting recent population dynamics. Niche models showed consistent habitat at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and modern times in the Rocky Mountains and northern United States, while the Great Basin may have been markedly less suitable at the LGM than today. The palaeorecord showed great spatio-temporal variability in the presence of N. cinerea, but documents broad-scale patterns of occupancy and regional population trends. Main conclusions The Quaternary dynamics and evolutionary history of N. cinerea appear to have been shaped by both vicariant events associated with geographical barriers and the availability of suitable habitat through time. Divergence of the two major clades dates to the Pliocene-Pleistocene transition, with clades separated by the Green and Colorado rivers and northern Rocky Mountain Pleistocene glaciations.

In contrast, oxygen isotope values from the southern Rocky Mountains increase abruptly similar to2.1 parts per thousand at similar to6200 C-14 yr B.P., then decrease similar to2.4 parts per thousand between similar to2000 C-14 yr B.P. and the present.

Although pebble counts of lithology are widely used, the information provided by a pebble count has been filtered by a potentially large number of processes and circumstances. Counts of pebble lithology and roundness together offer more power than lithology alone for the interpretation of provenance. In this study we analyze pebble counts of lithology and roundness in two contrasting fluvial systems of Pleistocene age to see how provenance varies with drainage size. The two systems are 1) a group of small high-gradient incised streams that formed alluvial fans and terraces and 2) a piedmont river that formed terraces in response to climate-driven cycles of aggradation and incision. We first analyze the data from these systems within their geographic and geologic context. After this is done, we employ contingency table analysis to complete the interpretation of pebble provenance. Small tributary streams that drain rugged mountains on both sides of the Santa Cruz River, southeast Arizona, deposited gravel in fan and terrace deposits of Pleistocene age. Volcanic, plutonic and, to a lesser extent, sedimentary rocks are the predominant pebble lithologies. Large contrasts in gravel lithology are evident among adjacent fans. Subangular to subrounded pebbles predominate. Contingency table analysis shows that hard volcanic rocks tend to remain angular and, even though transport distances have been short, soft tuff and sedimentary rocks tend to become rounded. The Wind River, a major piedmont stream in Wyoming, drains rugged mountains surrounding the northwest part of the Wind River basin. Under the influence of climate change and glaciation during the Pleistocene, the river deposited an extensive series of terrace gravels. In contrast to Santa Cruz tributary gravel, most of the Wind River gravel is relatively homogenous in lithology and is rounded to well-rounded. Detailed analysis reveals a multitude of sources in the headwaters and the basin itself, but lithologies from these sources are combined downstream. Well-rounded volcanic and recycled quartzite clasts were derived from the headwaters. Precambrian igneous and metamorphic clasts were brought down tributary valleys to the Wind River by glaciers, and sandstone was added where the river enters the Wind River structural basin.

The debate is still heated; however, there is widespread agreement that the Pleistocene glacial cycles forced the repeated contraction, fragmentation, and expansion of the North American biota. These demographic processes should leave genetic 'footprints' in modern descendants, suggesting that detailed population genetic studies of contemporary species provide the key to elucidating the impact of the late Quaternary (late Pleistocene-Holocene). We present an analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variation in the mountain chickadee (Poecile gambeli) in an attempt to examine the genetic evidence of the impact of the late Quaternary glacial cycles. Phylogenetic analyses reveal two strongly supported clades of P. gambeli: an Eastern Clade (Rocky Mountains and Great Basin) and a Western Clade (Sierra Nevada and Cascades). Post-glacial introgression is apparent between these two clades in the Mono Lake region of Central California. Within the Eastern Clade there is evidence of isolation-by-distance in the Rocky Mountain populations, and of limited gene flow into and around the Great Basin.

Two Frog Lake was isolated from the sea prior to 11,040 +/- 50 yr BP (13,030 cal. yr BP) when the climate was cool and dry, and open Pinus contorta woodlands covered the landscape. These woodlands were replaced by a mixed conifer forest ca. 10,200 yr BP (ca. 12,300 cal. yr BP) when the climate became moister. A relatively dry and warm early Holocene climate allowed Pseudotsuga menziesii to migrate northward to this site where it grew with Picea, Tsuga heterophylla and Alnus. The climate became cooler and moister at ca. 8,000 yr BP (ca. 9,200 cal. yr BP), approximately 500-1,000 years prior to sites located south of Two Frog Lake and on the Queen Charlotte Islands, but contemporary with sites on the northern mainland coast of British Columbia and south coastal Alaska. Climate heterogeneity in central coastal British Columbia appears to have occurred on a synoptic scale, suggesting that atmospheric dynamics linked to a variable Aleutian Low pressure system may have had an important influence on early Holocene climate change in the Seymour-Belize Inlet Complex. The transition to cooler and moister conditions facilitated the expansion of Cupressaceae and the establishment of a modern-type coastal temperate rainforest dominated by Cupressaceae and T. heterophylla. This was associated with progressive lake acidification.

Overall, it is suggested that climate change controls the downstream water: sediment ratio and sediment transport capacity, via operation of the continuity equation. Tectonics, specifically the rapid growth and propagation of structures, sets up gradient contrasts and upstream-migrating changes in transport capacity via operation of the diffusivity equation. A steady-state aggradational mode operated in the southern Rio Grande rift between similar to 5 and 0.8 Ma, causing preservation of ancestral axial-channel and floodplain deposits due to relatively slow, long-term active rift subsidence. The onset of major climatic change around 0.8 Ma resulted in the axial river periodically incising to a total extent of similar to 150 m, removing about 25% by volume of previously accumulated sediment, despite continued active faulting and fault-induced subsidence. This climatic mode is interpreted to be a periodic response to positive downstream gradients in sediment transport rate during glacial and glacial-transition periods, caused by low-level external sediment sourcing and a dominance of large magnitude spring snowmelt floods from northern mountain valleys. Tectonic drivers are spectacularly demonstrated in the Gulf of Corinth, where a new theory of 'piggy-back' basin abandonment and regional uplift is proposed, as formerly active rift-margin faults are progressively dragged above the flat slab of underriding African lithosphere. Basin abandonment occurred across newly propagating faults, with erosion and basin-fill incision of up to 800 m depth, as discontinuities in drainage channel slope have migrated rapidly upstream. In both rifts, sediment relaxation time, T-s = l(2)/kappa, where l is a length scale and. is sediment diffusivity, is probably short, since relevant length scales are small and diffusivities large. Thus in the Rio Grande rift, despite the great length of the river system as a whole, it is the balance between hydrological and sediment input from the many lateral tributaries that controls non-uniform transport capacity of the axial channel. In the case of the Gulf of Corinth rift, it is the high strain rate that causes diffusivity to be large in drainages cutting across rapidly vertically-growing normal faults.",2007,,Geology,WOS:000286661800002,Meghan,No,Maybe,No,,techtonic movement in the Rio Grande,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Meghan,No,Maybe,Paleo,techtonic movement in the Rio Grande,

The mean altitude exceeds 2 km above sea level and relief increases front 30 in in the river valleys of the Great Plains to more than 1.6 km deep in the canyons and basins of the Rocky Mountains and Colorado Plateau. Despite over a century of study, the timing and causes of elevation gain and incision in the region are unclear. Post-Laramide development of relief is thought to either result from tectonic activity or climatic change. Interpretation of which of these causes dominated is based upon reconstruction of datums developed from, and supported by, paleoelevation proxies and interpretations of landscape incision. Here we reconstruct a datum surface against which regional incision can be measured in order to evaluate late Cenozoic tectonic and climatic influences. The distribution, magnitude, and timing of post-Laramide basin filling and subsequent erosion are constrained by depositional remnants, topographic markers, and other indicators across the region. We suggest that post-Laramide basin filling resulted from slow subsidence during Oligocene to Miocene time. Incision into this basin fill surface began in late Miocene time and continues today. The pattern of incision is consistent with control by localized extensional tectonism superimposed upon regional domal surface uplift. Localized extension is associated with the projection of the Rio Grande Rift into the central Rockies, and the domal uplift generally coincides with the position of buoyant mantle anomalies interpreted at depth. If the magnitudes of incision directly reflect magnitudes of surface elevation gain, they are less than can be resolved by existing palcoelevation proxy methods. In addition, the combination of post-Laramide subsidence followed by regional surface uplift reduces the net magnitude of surface elevation change since Laramide time.",2006,10.1130/B25715.1,Geology,WOS:000235962700010,Meghan,No,Yes,No,,,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Meghan,No,Maybe,Paleo,paleo,

Long-term measurements of exhumation are not sufficient to capture the processes driving transient responses associated with short-term climatic oscillations, because of high variability of individual processes across space and time. This study compares the efficacy of different erosional agents to assess the importance of variability in tectonically active landscapes responding to fluctuations in Quaternary climate. We focus on the Teton Range, where erosional mechanisms include hillslope, glacial, and fluvial processes. Erosion rates were quantified using sediment accumulation and cosmogenic dating (bedrock and stream sediments). Results show that rates of erosion are highly variable, with average short-term rockfall rates (0.8 mm/y) occurring faster than either apparent basin-averaged (02 mm/y) and long-term ridge erosion rates (0.02 mm/y). Examining erosion rates separately also demonstrates the coupling between glacial, fluvial, and hillslope processes. Apparent basin-averaged erosion rates amalgamate valley wall and ridge erosion with stream and glacial rates. Climate oscillations drive the short-term response of a single erosional process (e.g., rockfalls or other mass wasting) that may enhance or limit the erosional efficiency of other processes (glacial or fluvial). While the Teton landscape may approach long-term equilibrium, stochastic processes and rapid response to short-term climate change actively perpetuate the transient ruggedness of the topography.

Four additional eastern North American basalt occurrences of probable early Paleozoic age were also examined. The Vendian occurrences comprise the Central Iapetus magmatic event of Eastern North America which extends from the Long Range dikes of Labrador and Newfoundland to the Catoctin flood basalts of Virginia and includes the Grenville dike swarm of Ontario and Quebec. The strike of the Vendian dike swarms converge near a major gravity and magnetic anomaly at Sutton Mountain, Quebec. The chemical composition of the Vendian basalts and diabase dikes plotted onto spider diagrams normalized to the composition of the silicate earth can be subdivided into a tight cluster of parallel lines displaying HFSE enrichment and a more diverse group that is less enriched. The tight grouping of the enriched cluster suggests a mutual genetic relationship consistent with mantle plume derivation based largely on chemical similarity to standard Ocean Island Basalt (OIB). However, detailed examination of this eastern Laurentian OIB related cluster (LOIB) reveals regional variations in chemical composition, particularly TiO2 and Zr, that can be contoured to delineate a narrow lens shape with peak concentrations centered close to the Sutton Mountain triple junction. The central portion of the LOIB is geochemically the same as superplume derived basalt. Radiometric evidence indicates that the LOIB superplume magmatic activity peaked at about 550 Ma. The less enriched group geochemically resembles some of Earth's larger continental flood basalts, such as the Columbia River basalt province, derived from a subcontinental lithospheric mantle source mixed with magma from a mantle plume source. Radiometric and paleomagnetic evidence indicates that this less enriched group is about 615 to 564 Ma and probably extruded out of rifts that preceded the break-up of Pannotia. This mid-Vendian magmatism is consistent with the early stages of deep mantle plume upwelling but may be genetically independent of the superplume magmatism that followed. The four early Paleozoic basalt suites examined are interpreted as post-LOIB, lapetan Ocean ridge basalt accreted onto eastern Laurentian or perhaps basalt extruded from transform faults that intersected the trailing edge of Laurentia. If LOIB magmatism was generated by a superplume head, there may be important environmental implications. The LOIB event may have been partially responsible for considerable mantle outgassing, particularly carbon dioxide and nutrients, global warming, and major increases in the growth rate and deposition of marine life that occurred during the early Cambrian.",2002,10.2475/ajs.302.1.1,Geology,WOS:000175797400001,Shana,No,Yes,No,,Eastern Canada,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Meghan,Maybe,Maybe,Paleo,paleo,

Previous studies in two treeline communities within the alpine-treeline ecotone on the Rocky Mountain Front in northwestern Montana, U.S.A., indicated that whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis) serves as the majority tree island initiator, thus facilitating the development of tree islands (Resler and Tomback, 2008). However, 33.7% of whitebark pine at these treeline study sites were infected by the introduced pathogen Cronartium ribicola, which causes white pine blister rust. We examined the prevalence of whitebark pine, its ecological role, and the incidence of blister rust within two study sites, Tibbs Butte and Wyoming Creek, to the south on the Beartooth Plateau, and within two study sites, Stanley Glacier and Gibbon Pass, to the north in Kootenay and Banff National Parks, for comparison with information from the Rocky Mountain Front (Resler and Tomback, 2008). We found that whitebark pine was an important component of treeline communities in both the southern and northern study areas, although its abundance and ecological role varied with study site. Nearly half the solitary trees sampled overall in the northern and southern study areas were whitebark pine. Whitebark pine was also the most frequently occurring conifer species among tree islands at three of the four study sites.

Blister rust incidence for the Wyoming Creek study site in the southern study area was 7.7%, and for the Stanley Glacier study site in the northern study area, 16.2%.

The model was parameterized at a study site in central Idaho, United States (US), and evaluated at an independent site in northern Washington, US. Phloem and air temperatures, MPB spatial impact data from USDA Forest Service aerial detection surveys, and remotely sensed host tree density data were used to parameterize the model using a maximum likelihood approach. At both study sites the model was highly accurate (>84%) in predicting annual pattern formation when the model was re-initiated each year with the location of new patches of infested trees.

This unique characteristic, along with the tremendous property damage and potential loss of life that occur with large wildfires with erratic behavior, raised the question of whether future climate will favor rapid wildfire growth so that similar wildfire activity may become more frequent as climate changes. This study addresses this question by examining differences in the climatological distribution of the Haines index (HI) between the current and projected future climate over the western United States. The HI, ranging from 2 to 6, was designed to characterize dry, unstable air in the lower atmosphere that may contribute to erratic or extreme fire behavior. A shift in HI distribution from low values (2 and 3) to higher values (5 and 6) would indicate an increased risk for rapid wildfire growth and spread. Distributions of Haines index are calculated from simulations of current (1971-2000) and future (2041-70) climate using multiple regional climate models in the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program. Despite some differences among the projections, the simulations indicate that there may be not only more days but also more consecutive days with HI 5 during August in the future. This result suggests that future atmospheric environments will be more conducive to erratic wildfires in the mountainous regions of the western United States.",2013,10.1175/JAMC-D-12-0317.1,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,WOS:000326836900003,Adrienne,Yes,Yes,Yes,Landscape/State-Province,,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Meghan,Yes,Yes,Yes,,

In mountainous areas, such as western North America, recent shifts toward an earlier spring peak flow and decreases in low flow during summer/fall have been reported. We hypothesized that an earlier peak flow could be shifting the timing of low flow and leading to a decrease in the interval between T (max_w) and Q (min). We also examined if years with extreme low Q (min) were associated with years of extreme high T (max_w). We tested these hypotheses using long-term data from 22 minimally human-influenced streams for the period 1950-2010. We found trends toward a shorter time lag between T (max_w) and Q (min) over time and a strong negative association between their magnitudes.

We measured atmospheric N deposition, lake water quality, and sediment diatoms at our study lakes. Water chemistry showed that our study lakes were ultra-oligotrophic with ammonia and nitrate concentrations often at or below detection limits with low specific conductance (<100 mu S/cm), and acid neutralizing capacities (<400 mu eq/L). Rates of summer bulk inorganic N deposition at all our sites ranged from 0.6 to 2.4 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) and were variable both within and across the parks. Diatom assemblages in a single sediment core from Hoh Lake (Olympic National Park) displayed a shift to increased relative abundances of Asterionella formosa and Fragilaria tenera beginning in the 1969-1975 timeframe, whereas these species were not found at the remaining (nine) sites. These diatom species are known to be indicative of N enrichment and were used to determine an empirical critical load of N deposition, or threshold level, where changes in diatom communities were observed at Hoh Lake. However, N deposition at the remaining nine lakes does not seem to exceed a critical load at this time. At Milk Lake, also in Olympic National Park, there was some evidence that climate change might be altering diatom communities, but more research is needed to confirm this. We used modeled precipitation for Hoh Lake and annual inorganic N concentrations from a nearby National Atmospheric Deposition Program station, to calculate elevation-corrected N deposition for 19802009 at Hoh Lake.

The intensity of this impact will depend on the dispersal rates of the species, the patchiness of the environment, and the velocity of habitat change. Here we examine how dispersal affects projected future habitat availability for a threatened carnivore, the fisher (Pekania [Martes] pennanti). We used non-invasive genetic sampling to detect fisher across their historical distribution in Montana and Idaho. This survey included 4846 non-invasive hair snares, of which 288 identified fishers through mitochondrial DNA analysis. We modeled the distribution of fisher across western Montana and northern Idaho using a suite of vegetative, topographic, and climatic variables. We modeled future distribution using a global climate model and two climate change scenarios (high emissions [A2] or reduced emissions [B2]) and three time steps (2030, 2060, and 2090). We incorporated the effects of dispersal ability and habitat patch size into our model by varying the distance and enforcing a minimum patch size at which newly created habitat could be colonized. We found that the probability of current fisher occurrence was highest given the presence of mesic forest types with tall trees, high annual precipitation, and mid-range winter temperatures. Future predictions show an increase in area of high-probability habitat under most dispersal assumptions. Interestingly, we found a large contrast in results when minimum patch size and species dispersal capabilities were considered. Our distribution model with full dispersal and no limits on patch size predicted a 24.5% increase in fisher habitat by 2090, whereas a dispersal limit of 1 km through non-habitat (agricultural fields and urban zones) and a minimum patch size yielded a loss of 25.8% of fisher habitat under this same scenario. Varying dispersal appears to limit habitat availability more than minimum patch size under most scenarios.

Relatively little is known about hydrograph (shape, peak flow) influence or the relative importance of chronic and episodic hillslope inputs on channel conditions. To better understand these external drivers, we calculated sediment routing through a gravel-bedded river network using a one-dimensional (1D) bedload transport model. We calculated changes in grain sizes and estimated Chinook salmon habitat suitability caused by a dry year and an extreme flood hydrograph, and chronic (diffusive, overland flow) or pulse (landslide, debris flow) hillslope sediment supplies. To obtain accurate channel conditions, a relatively high reference Shields stress, representative of steep mountain streams, was needed. An extreme event flood without any hillslope sediment inputs caused widespread bed coarsening and a decrease in aquatic habitat. Chronic sediment input combined with this hydrograph eliminated any changes in grain size and habitat, although when combined with a dry year flow, caused systematic bed fining. The influence of a given hydrograph therefore highly depends on the hillslope sediment supply. Regardless of the flow hydrograph or sediment pulse timing, grain size distribution or location, pulse sediment inputs did not cause widespread grain size changes despite being 100 times the total chronic input volume. Widespread and continuous hillslope sediment inputs may influence channel grain sizes and aquatic habitat more than a single discrete sediment pulse. Depending on the magnitudes of flow hydrograph and sediment supply alterations, climate change may induce no differences in grain sizes or very dramatic changes with significant consequences for long-term sustainability.

Understanding biotic responses to such perturbations and the contribution of high-elevation headwaters to riverine biodiversity requires the assessment of assemblage composition among habitat types. We compared aquatic insect assemblages among headwater stream segment types in relict glaciated subalpine basins in Mt. Rainier National Park, Washington, USA. Aquatic insects were collected during summer and autumn in three headwater basins. In each basin, three different stream segment types were sampled: colluvial groundwater sources, alluvial lake inlets, and cascade-bedrock lake outlets. Ward's hierarchical cluster analysis revealed high diversity in aquatic insect assemblages, and non-metric multidimensional scaling indicated that spatial and temporal patterns in assemblage composition differed among headwater stream segment types. Aquatic insect assemblages showed more fidelity to stream segment types than to individual basins, and the principal environmental variables associated with assemblage structure were temperature and substrate. Indicator species analyses identified specific aquatic insects associated with each stream segment type. Several rare and potentially endemic aquatic insect taxa were present, including the recently described species, Lednia borealis (Baumann and Kondratieff). Our results indicate that aquatic insect assemblages in relict glaciated subalpine headwaters were strongly differentiated among stream segment types.

Projected warming over the 21st century is anticipated to shift the phase of precipitation toward more rain and less snow in mountainous areas in the Pacific Northwest, resulting in smaller winter snowpack and in a shift in the timing of runoff to earlier in the year. This will be accompanied by spatially variable changes in the timing of groundwater recharge. Analysis of historic climate and hydrologic data and modeling studies show that groundwater plays a key role in determining the response of stream systems to climate change. The spatial variability in the response of groundwater systems to climate change, particularly with regard to flow-system scale, however, has generally not been addressed in the literature. Here we simulate the hydrologic response to projected future climate to show that the response of groundwater systems can vary depending on the location and spatial scale of the flow systems and their aquifer characteristics. Mean annual recharge averaged over the basin does not change significantly between the 1980s and 2080s climate periods given the ensemble of global climate models and emission scenarios evaluated. There are, however, changes in the seasonality of groundwater recharge within the basin. Simulation results show that short-flow-path groundwater systems, such as those providing baseflow to many head-water streams, will likely have substantial changes in the timing of discharge in response changes in seasonality of recharge. Regional-scale aquifer systems with flow paths on the order of many tens of kilometers, in contrast, are much less affected by changes in seasonality of recharge. Flow systems at all spatial scales, however, are likely to reflect interannual changes in total recharge. These results provide insights into the possible impacts of climate change to other regional aquifer systems, and the streams they support, where discharge points represent a range of flow system scales.

Two important Canadian insects were considered: western spruce budworm (WSBW; Choristoneura occidentalis Freeman, Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), and spruce bark beetle (SBB; Dendroctonus rufipennis Kirby, Coleoptera: Curculionidae). This paper integrates projections of tree species suitability, pest outbreak risk, and bio-economic modelling. Several methods of estimating pest outbreak risk were investigated. A simple climate envelope method based on empirically derived climate thresholds indicates substantial changes in the distribution of outbreaks in British Columbia for two climate scenarios and both pests. A ""proof of concept"" bio-economic model, to inform forest management decisions in a changing climate, considers major stand-level harvest decision factors, such as preservation of old-growth forest, and even harvest flow rates in the presence of changing tree species suitability and outbreak risk. The model was applied to data for the Okanagan Timber Supply Area and also the entire Province of British Columbia. At the provincial level, the model determined little net timber production impact, depending on which of two climate scenarios was considered. Several potentially important factors not considered in this first version of the model are discussed, which indicates that impact may be underestimated by this preliminary study. Despite these factors, negative impacts were projected at the Okanagan Timber Supply Area level for both scenarios.

We examined changes in understory plant communities following a widespread, drought-induced die-off of trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) in the western United States. We assessed shrub and herbaceous cover and volume in quadrats in 55 plots located across a wide range of levels of aspen mortality. We measured species richness and composition of herbaceous plant communities by recording species presence and absence in 12 sets of paired (1 healthy, 1 dying) aspen plots. Although understory composition in healthy and dying stands was heterogeneous across the landscape, shrub abundance, cover, and volume were higher and abundance of herbaceous species, cover, and volume were lower in dying aspen stands. Shrub cover and volume increased from 2009 to 2011 in dying stands, which suggests that shrub growth and expansion is ongoing. Species richness of herbs declined by 23% in dying stands. Composition of herbs differed significantly between dying and healthy stands. Richness of non-native species did not differ between stand types. The understory community in dying aspen stands was not similar to other shrub-dominated plant communities in the region and may constitute a novel community.

A conceptual snowmelt-runoff model was developed that is forced by daily time series of temperature and precipitation. The model can be run using either observed climate data or artificial climate data generated from a GCM or a stochastic model. The model was applied to a case-study basin, the north fork of the Clearwater River in Idaho, using stochastically generated climate scenarios. Climate scenarios were generated using a contemporaneous auto-regressive integrated moving average (CARIMA) model for temperature and a precipitation model based on a two-state first-order Markov process. A baseline climate scenario was developed that represents recently observed temperature and precipitation conditions and then 15 additional climate scenarios that represent shifts in recent conditions. For each scenario, model application produced an ensemble of 50 streamflow traces each spanning 30 yr. Results show that an increase in temperature among scenarios leads to a decrease in streamflow and vice versa. Decreases in temperature shift the basin runoff to fully snowmelt dominated, whereas increases in temperature increase the frequency of midwinter runoff events. Increasing precipitation leads to increased runoff in cases where the temperature remains the same as the observed record, but not in cases where the temperature increases.

Calibration and validation of the macroscale hydrology model in this highly monitored watershed is key to address the watershed processes that are vulnerable to both natural climate variability and climate change. The model was calibrated using the streamflow data collected between 1997 and 2006 from the three nested weirs, the Reynolds Mountain East (RME), Tollgate and Outlet. For assessing the performance of the calibrated model, this study used 30 years of streamflow data for the period between 1966 and 1996. This investigation suggested that the model predicted streamflow was best at RME, and inadequate at Outlet. Simulated soil moisture was also verified using the data available from five soil moisture measurement sites. The model was able to capture the seasonal patterns of changes in soil water storage considering the differences in the spatial extent of the observed and predicted soil water storage (point measurements against the spatially averaged values for the HRU) and uncertainty associated with the soil moisture measurements due to instrument effects. Water budget partitioning during a wet (1984) water year and a dry (1987) water year were also analyzed to characterize the differences in hydrologic cycles during the extreme hydrologic conditions. Our analysis showed that in the dry water year, vegetation at the higher elevation were under water stress by the end of the water year. Contrastingly, in the wet water year only the vegetation at low and mid-elevations were under water stress whereas vegetation at the higher elevations derived substantial soil moisture for ET processes even towards the end of the growing season. To understand the effect of climate change on the hydrologic cycle, the observed and simulated streamflow were analyzed for trends in Center of Timing (CT). Earlier CT timings for the simulated and observed streamflow at RME weir was obvious thus manifesting global warming signals at the watershed scale level in the Intermountain west region. Observed streamflow at the Tollgate and Outlet weirs, where streamflow is partially affected by the agricultural diversions, showed later CT timings and these results appeared to suggest that climate impact assessment studies need to carefully distinguish the system behavior that is altered by both natural and human-induced changes.

The roles of the various dispersal processes acting as drivers of range expansion are poorly understood for most species. The aim of this paper is to characterize the movement patterns of the mountain pine beetle in areas where range expansion is occurring, in order to describe the fine-scale spatial dynamics of processes associated with mountain pine beetle range expansion. Location Three regions of Canada's Rocky Mountains: Kicking Horse Pass, Yellowhead Pass and Pine Pass. Methods Data on locations of mountain pine beetle-attacked trees of predominantly lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia) were obtained from annual fixed-wing aircraft surveys of forest health and helicopter-based GPS surveys of mountain pine beetle-damaged areas in British Columbia and Alberta. The annual (1999-2005) spatial extents of outbreak ranges were delineated from these data. Spatial analysis was conducted using the spatial-temporal analysis of moving polygons (STAMP), a recently developed pattern-based approach. Results We found that distant dispersal patterns (spot infestations) were most often associated with marginal increases in the areal size of mountain pine beetle range polygons. When the mountain pine beetle range size increased rapidly relative to the years examined, local dispersal patterns (adjacent infestation) were more common. In Pine Pass, long-range dispersal (> 2 km) markedly extended the north-east border of the mountain pine beetle range. In Yellowhead Pass and Kicking Horse Pass, the extension of the range occurred incrementally via ground-based spread. Main conclusions Dispersal of mountain pine beetle varies with geography as well as with host and beetle population dynamics. Although colonization is mediated by habitat connectivity, during periods of low overall habitat expansion, dispersal to new distant locations is common, whereas during periods of rapid invasion, locally connected spread is the dominant mode of dispersal. The propensity for long-range transport to establish new beetle populations, and thus to be considered a driver of range expansion, is likely to be determined by regional weather patterns, and influenced by local topography. We conclude that STAMP appears to be a useful approach for examining changes in biogeograpical ranges, with the potential to reveal both fine- and large-scale patterns.",2009,10.1111/j.1365-2699.2009.02100.x,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Physical Geography,WOS:000268056000004,Courtney,Yes,Yes,Yes,Biome/National,"BC, among other locations, pine beetles",NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Meghan,Yes,Yes,Yes,"BC, among other locations, pine beetles",

Habitat restoration strategies that address limited environmental attributes and partial salmon life-history requirements or approaches that attempt to force aquatic habitat to conform to idealized but ecologically unsustainable conditions may partly explain this lack of response. Natural watershed processes generate highly variable environmental conditions and population responses, i.e., multiple life histories, that are often not considered in restoration. Examples from several locations underscore the importance of natural variability to the resilience of Pacific salmon. The implication is that habitat restoration efforts will be more likely to foster salmon resilience if they consider processes that generate and maintain natural variability in fresh water. We identify three specific criteria for management based on natural variability: the capacity of aquatic habitat to recover from disturbance, a range of habitats distributed across stream networks through time sufficient to fulfill the requirements of diverse salmon life histories, and ecological connectivity. In light of these considerations, we discuss current threats to habitat resilience and describe how regulatory and restoration approaches can be modified to better incorporate natural variability.",2009,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WOS:000267846300051,Courtney,Yes,Yes,Yes,Landscape/State-Province,"PNW, salmon recovery",NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Meghan,Yes,Yes,Yes,"PNW, salmon recovery",

North Cascade glacier retreat is rapid and ubiquitous. All 47 monitored glaciers are currently undergoing a significant retreat and four of them have disappeared. Annual mass balance measured on ten glaciers, averaging 30-50 m in thickness, yields a mean cumulative annual balance for the 1984-2006 period of -12.4 m water equivalent (m we), a net loss of 14 m in glacier thickness and 20-40% loss of their total volume in two decades. The data indicate broad regional continuity in North Cascades glacial response to climate. The substantial negative annual balances have accompanied significant thinning in the accumulation zone of 75% of North Cascade glaciers monitored. This is indicative of glacier disequilibrium; a glacier in disequilibrium will not survive the current warmer climate trend. Alpine snowpack snow water equivalent (SWE) on April I has declined 25% since 1946 at five USDA Snow Course sites. This decline has occurred in spite of a slight increase in winter precipitation.

Climatic change will have significant impacts on natural disturbances, species and ecosystems, particularly on landscapes influenced by forest management. Understanding where vulnerabilities lie is important in managing the risks associated directly or indirectly with climatic change. The vulnerability of landscapes to natural disturbances, the resilience of ecosystems and distribution of species are all important components that need to be considered when undertaking forest planning, but climatic change is rarely factored into such planning. In this study, the vulnerability of fire potential, fire regimes, ecosystems and species to climatic change was modelled for a 145,000 ha landscape in the south-central interior of British Columbia, Canada. The results from these analyses were used to guide forest zoning, using the triad zoning framework, and for the development of a ""climate-smart"" management framework. The use of climate-smart management is advocated as a decision-making framework for managing forested landscapes based on an understanding of landscape vulnerability to future climatic change. From this understanding, the maintenance of ecosystem health and vitality could be achieved. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

As air temperature increases with global climate change, the character of the generally established seasonal snowcover will be affected. To study the specific response to variable climate, a carefully collected and processed meteorological data set for the 1984-2008 water years (WYs) was assembled for a snow-dominated headwater mountain catchment. The data were used to force a physically based, distributed energy balance snow model to simulate patterns of snow deposition and melt over the catchment for the 25-year period. This period covers both the highest (1984) and lowest (1992) snow seasons on record and exhibits extreme inter-annual variability. This unique forcing data set captured meteorological conditions that resulted in the range of variability in snowcover accumulation, timing of ablation, and the timing and amount of surface water input (SWI), and discharge during the 25-year study period. SWI is the amount of liquid water delivered to the soil surface from melting snow or from rain that passes through the snowcover or falls directly on the soil. Warm winters, characterized by early-and mid-winter rain, triggered earlier inputs from SWI and response in discharge than cool winters. Cool conditions prolonged the generation of SWI and streamflow out of the basin. Very wet conditions that were warm passed 50% of the SWI 27 days earlier and passed 50% of the discharge 15 days earlier, when compared to very wet conditions that were cool. Warmer conditions produced less snow water equivalent, shortened the melt season, and would be expected to extend the summer drought. Copyright.

Mixed-severity forest types are poorly documented and little understood but likely occupy significant areas in the western United States. By definition, mixed-severity types have high beta diversity at meso-scales, encompassing patches of both high and low severity and gradients in between. Studies of mixed-severity types reveal complex landscapes in which patch sizes follow a power law distribution with many small and few large patches. Forest types characterized by mixed severity can be classified according to the modal proportion of high to low severity patches, which increases from relatively dry to relatively mesic site conditions. Mixed-severity regimes are produced by interactions between top-down forcing by climate and bottom-up shaping by topography and the flammability of vegetation, although specific effects may vary widely across the region, especially the relation between aspect and fire severity. History is important in shaping fire behavior in mixed-severity landscapes, as patterns laid down by previous fires can play a significant role in shaping future fires. Like low-severity forests in the western United States, many dry mixed-severity types experienced significant increases in stand density during the 20th century, threatening forest health and biodiversity, however not all understory development in mixed-severity forests increases the threat of severe wild fires. In general, current landscapes have been homogenized, reducing beta diversity and increasing the probability of large fires and insect outbreaks. Further loss of old, fire tolerant trees is of particular concern, but understory diversity has been reduced as well. High stand densities on relatively dry sites increase water use and therefore susceptibility to drought and insect outbreaks, exacerbating a trend of increasing regional drying. The need to restore beta diversity while protecting habitat for closed-forest specialists such as the northern spotted owl call for landscape-level approaches to ecological restoration.

Although transitions between air masses are significant features of the general circulation that influence human activities and other surface processes, they are much more difficult to objectively identify than single variables like temperature or even extreme events like fires, droughts, and floods. The recently developed Spatial Synoptic Classification (SSC) provides a fairly objective means of identifying frontal passages. In this research, we determine the specific meteorological patterns represented by the SSC's Transition category, a ""catch-all"" group that attempts to identify those days that cannot be characterized as a single, homogeneous air mass type. The result is a detailed transition climatology for the continental USA. We identify four subtypes of the Transition category based on intra-day sea level pressure change and dew point temperature change. Across the contiguous USA, most transition days are identified as cold fronts and warm fronts during the winter season. Among the two less common subtypes, transition days in which the dew point temperature and pressure both rise are more frequently observed across the western states, and days in which both variables fall are more frequently observed in coastal regions. The relative frequencies of wintertime warm and cold fronts have changed over the period 1951-2007. Relative cold front frequency has significantly increased in the Northeast and Midwest regions, and warm front frequencies have declined in the Midwest, Rocky Mountain, and Pacific Northwest regions. The overall shift toward cold fronts and away from warm fronts across the northern USA arises from a combination of an enhanced ridge over western North America and a northward shift of storm tracks throughout the mid-latitudes.

Modelling the response of species in their regeneration niche to phenological and biophysical processes that are directly influenced by climate is one method for achieving this understanding. A model was developed to investigate species resilience and vulnerability to climate change within its fundamental-regeneration niche. The utility of the developed model, tree and climate assessment (TACA), was tested within the interior Douglas-fir ecosystem in south-central British Columbia. TACA modelled the current potential tree species composition of the ecosystem with high accuracy and modelled significant responses amongst tree species to climate change. The response of individual species suggests that the studied ecosystem could transition to a new ecosystem over the next 100 years. TACA showed that it can be an effective tool for identifying species resilience and vulnerability to changes in climate within the most sensitive stage of development, the regeneration phase. The TACA model was able to identify the degree of change in phenological and biophysical variables that control tree establishment, growth and persistence. The response to changes in one or more of these variables resulted in changes in the climatic suitability of the ecosystem for species and enabled a measure of vulnerability to be quantified. TACA could be useful to forest managers as a decision support tool for adaptation actions and by researchers interested in modelling stand dynamics under climate change. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The analysis of two-way nested 36-12-km MM5 simulations during the 1998 snowmelt season (April-June) shows that the snow water equivalent (SWE) is underestimated when there are conditions with higher temperature and greater precipitation than observations. An observed daily SWE dataset derived from the snow telemetry network was assimilated into the Noah land surface model within MM5. This SWE assimilation reduces the warm bias. The reduction of the warm bias results from suppressed upward sensible heat flux caused by the decreased skin temperature. This skin temperature reduction is the result of the longer assimilated snow duration than in the model run without SWE assimilation. Meanwhile, the cooled surface leads to a more stable atmosphere, resulting in a decrease in the exaggerated precipitation. Additionally, the detailed analysis of the snowmelt indicates that the absence of vegetation fraction in the most sophisticated land surface model ( Noah) in the MM5 package results in an overestimation of solar radiation reaching the snow surface, giving rise to heavier snowmelt. An underestimated surface albedo also weakly contributes to the stronger snowmelt. The roles of the vegetation fraction and albedo in snowmelt are further verified by an additional offline simulation from a more realistic land surface model with advanced snow and vegetation schemes forced by the MM5 output. An improvement in SWE description is clearly seen in this offline simulation over the Sierra Nevada region.",2007,10.1175/JHM565.1,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,WOS:000246061100009,Meghan,Yes,Yes,Yes,Landscape/State-Province,"Western US, snow-climate models",NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Meghan,Yes,Yes,Yes,"Western US, snow-climate models",

We asked how variation in the frequency of large fire events affects (1) the mean and annual variability of age and tree density (defined by postfire sapling density and subsequent stand density) of lodgepole pine stands and (2) the spatial pattern of stand age and density across the landscape. The model incorporates spatial and temporal variation in fire and serotiny in predicting postfire sapling densities of lodgepole pine. Empirical self-thinning and in-filling curves alter initital postfire sapling densities over decades to centuries. In response to a six-fold increase in the probability of large fires (0.003 to 0.018 year), mean stand age declined from 291 to 121 years.

A pollen-based vegetation reconstruction indicates five periods of vegetation change. At 10,300 cal yr B.P. Pinus-Juniperus parkland colonized the valley and by 7600 cal yr B.P. was replaced by mixed stands of Pinus, Picea and Pseudotsuga/Larix. Fire frequencies increased to their Holocene maximums during the 8200-4000 cal yr B.P. period. From 5500-4500 cal yr B.P. Pseudotsuga/Larix reached its maximum extent in the Kootenay Valley under a more frequent fire regime. At 5000 cal yr B.P. Picea and Abies began to expand in the area and by 4500 cal yr B.P. the forest shifted to a closed montane spruce forest type with dramatically reduced fire frequency. The shift to less frequent forest fires after 4500 cal yr B.P., along with a moisterPicea - dominated closed forest, corresponds to Neoglacial advances in the Canadian Rockies and Coast Mountains. Fire intervals after 4000 cal yr B.P. are significantly longer than the shorter fire intervals of the early to mid Holocene. A return to drier, more open forest condition occurs between 2400-1200 cal yr B.P. with a slight increase in fire activity and summer drought events. Lower lake levels inferred by charophyte accumulation rates during the 2400-1200 cal yr B.P. interval support this moisture regime shift. An abrupt shift toPicea dominated forest occurred from 1200-1000 cal yr B.P. and a final period of wet-closed forest cover reaches its maximum extent from 700-150 cal yr B.P. that appears to be a response to Little Ice Age cooling. Present forests are within their natural range of variability but are predicted to shift again to a drier more open structure with increased Pseudotsuga/Larix cover.

Because instrumental records for the region are limited to the twentieth century, knowledge of the range of variability associated with these moisture anomalies and their impacts on ecosystems and physical processes are limited. The authors developed a reconstruction of summer ( June - August) moisture variability spanning A. D. 1540 - 2000 from a multispecies network of tree-ring chronologies in Glacier NP. Decadal-scale drought and pluvial regimes were defined as any event lasting 10 yr or greater, and the significance of each potential regime was assessed using intervention analysis. Intervention analysis prevents single intervening years of average or opposing moisture conditions from ending what was otherwise a sustained moisture regime. The reconstruction shows numerous decadal-scale shifts between persistent drought and wet events prior to the instrumental period ( before A. D. 1900). Notable wet events include a series of three long-duration, high-magnitude pluvial regimes spanning the end of the Little Ice Age ( A. D. 1770 - 1840). Though the late-nineteenth century was marked by a series of > 10 yr droughts, the single most severe dry event occurred in the early-twentieth century ( A. D. 1917 - 41). These decadal-scale dry and wet events, in conjunction with periods of high and low snowpack, have served as a driver of ecosystem processes such as forest fires and glacial dynamics in the Glacier NP region. Using a suite of paleoproxy reconstructions and information from previous studies examining the relationship between climate variability and natural processes, the authors explore how such persistent moisture anomalies affect the delivery of vital goods and services provided by Glacier NP and surrounding areas. These analyses show that regional water resources and tourism are particularly vulnerable to persistent moisture anomalies in the Glacier NP area. Many of these same decadal-scale wet and dry events were also seen among a wider network of hydroclimatic reconstructions along a north - south transect of the Rocky Mountains. Such natural climate variability can, in turn, have enormous impacts on the sustainable provision of natural resources over wide areas.

Empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis was used to identify coherent patterns in area burned by wildfire in the Pacific Northwest. Anomaly fields of 500-hPa height were regressed onto the resulting principal-component time series.,to identify the patterns in atmospheric circulation that are associated with variability in area burned by wildfire. Additionally, cross-correlation functions were calculated for the Palmer drought severity index (PDSI) over the year preceding the wildfire season. Parallel analyses based on superposed epoch analysis focused only on the extreme fire years (both large and small) to discriminate the controls on extreme years from the linear responses identified in the regression analyses. Four distinct patterns in area burned were identified, each associated,with distinct-climatic processes. Extreme wildfire years are forced at least in part by antecedent drought and summertime blocking,in the 500-hPa height field. However the response to these forcing's is modulated by the ecology of the dominant forest. In more mesic forest types. antecedent, drought is a necessary precondition for forests to burn, but it is not a good predictor of area burned due to the rarity of subsequent ignition. At especially dry locations, summertime blocking events can lead to increases in area burned even in the absence of antecedent drought. At particularly xeric locations summertime cyclones can also lead to increased area burned, probably due to dry lightning storms that bring ignition and strong winds but little precipitation.. These results suggest that fuels treatments alone may not be effective at reducing area burned under extreme climatic conditions and furthermore that anthropogenic climate change may have important implications for forest management.",2005,10.1890/03-5116,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WOS:000227120700013,Meghan,Yes,Yes,Yes,Landscape/State-Province,National Forests of the Western US (Nez Perce National Forest),NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Meghan,Yes,Yes,Yes,National Forests of the Western US (Nez Perce National Forest),

Model simulations revealed that variability in habitat conditions among streams (depth, available habitat) mediated the effects of forest harvest and climate change. Net effects for most simulated trout responses were different from or less than the sum of their separate scenarios. In some cases, forest harvest countered the effects of climate change through increased summer flow. Climate change most strongly influenced trout (earlier fry emergence, reductions in biomass of older trout, increased biomass of young-of-year), but these changes did not consistently translate into reductions in biomass over time. Forest harvest, in contrast, produced fewer and less consistent responses in trout. Earlier fry emergence driven by climate change was the most consistent simulated response, whereas survival, growth, and biomass were inconsistent.

Summer stream temperatures strongly influenced sculpin distributions, with mean August 2007 water temperatures increasing in order of reaches characterized as: Columbia Slimy Sculpin-dominated, syntopic, Rocky Mountain Sculpin-dominated, and no sculpin. Columbia Slimy Sculpin occurred in cold tributaries a the Blackfoot, Clark Fork, and Bitterroot rivers and in two coldwater refugia in the mainstem Bitterroot River. In contrast, Rocky Mountain Sculpin occupied warmer downstream segments of many Blackfoot and Clark Fork river tributaries as well as some mainstem reaches of both rivers but were absent from the Bitterroot River drainage. Persistence of the taxa will likely depend, both directly and indirectly, on future water temperatures, and thus, sculpins are appropriate targets for researching and monitoring biological changes resulting from climate change.",2015,10.1643/CE-14-229,Zoology,WOS:000358754300014,Micah,Yes,Yes,Yes,,"Clark Fork, MT",NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Meghan,Yes,Yes,Yes,"Clark Fork, MT",

Nevertheless, few studies have measured how climatic variation influences genetic diversity within populations or how genetic diversity is distributed across space relative to future climatic stress. Here, we tested whether patterns of genetic diversity (allelic richness) were related to climatic variation and habitat features in 130 bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus) populations from 24 watersheds (i.e., similar to 4-7th order river subbasins) across the Columbia River Basin, USA. We then determined whether bull trout genetic diversity was related to climate vulnerability at the watershed scale, which we quantified on the basis of exposure to future climatic conditions (projected scenarios for the 2040s) and existing habitat complexity. We found a strong gradient in genetic diversity in bull trout populations across the Columbia River Basin, where populations located in the most upstream headwater areas had the greatest genetic diversity. After accounting for spatial patterns with linear mixed models, allelic richness in bull trout populations was positively related to habitat patch size and complexity, and negatively related to maximum summer temperature and the frequency of winter flooding. These relationships strongly suggest that climatic variation influences evolutionary processes in this threatened species and that genetic diversity will likely decrease due to future climate change. Vulnerability at a watershed scale was negatively correlated with average genetic diversity (r=-0.77; P<0.001); watersheds containing populations with lower average genetic diversity generally had the lowest habitat complexity, warmest stream temperatures, and greatest frequency of winter flooding. Together, these findings have important conservation implications for bull trout and other imperiled species. Genetic diversity is already depressed where climatic vulnerability is highest; it will likely erode further in the very places where diversity may be most needed for future persistence.",2015,10.1111/gcb.12850,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WOS:000356422500006,Micah,Yes,Yes,Yes,,CRB,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Meghan,Yes,Yes,Yes,CRB,

However, in the 12 warmer regions, recent epidemics cannot be attributed to warming winters because earlier winters were not cold enough to kill D. ponderosae.

Although from the management perspective information on beetle emergence is crucial in determining an appropriate timing to monitor beetle populations and mitigate outbreaks, especially at the landscape scale in a changing climate, no attempt has yet been made to map the spatiotemporal patterns of beetle emergence across the landscape. In this study, we used a novel heating cycle approach to map potential beetle emergence spatially and temporally. This study reveals that the thermal environment and timing for potential beetle emergence are spatially and temporally synchronous across the landscape. The spatial synchrony in potential beetle emergence occurs at a distance of more than 1500 km across the BC landscape. The spatiotemporal patterns of potential beetle emergence vary with the defined factors (region, period, latitude, elevation, and landform type). At the provincial and regional levels, the thermal environment for potential beetle emergence is surprisingly warmer during 1977-1987 compared to 1999-2010 except for the Southeast region although the provincial climate and weather are generally warmer during 1999-2010 than during 1977-1987, suggesting a small increase in annual temperature may not be enough to significantly improve the thermal environment. A warmer thermal environment with a larger temporal window for potential beetle emergence (i.e., the potential emergence starts earlier and ends later) is associated with the Southeast region, lower latitude and elevation, and landscape topographic features of canyons and valleys. However, although the thermal environment varies with the defined factors, the timing and window of potential beetle peak emergence remain consistent among these defined factors, suggesting that beetles may take different strategies to adapt to temporally synchronized thermal windows in the regions and areas with varied thermal environments. The summarized variables of heating cycles are limited in generally predicting the beetle infestations for a specific period, especially at endemic and incipient levels. However, they may play a greater role in predicting more severely infested areas. The heating cycle approach demonstrated in this study may provide a simple complementary tool to the existing climate suitability models in assessing the impacts of climate change on beetle outbreaks, particularly for those bark beetle species whose physiological responses to temperature have not been fully studied.

Metapopulation theory predicts that persistence is directly related to local patch size and its characteristics, but because these relationships tend to be taxon-specific, empirical data are important. We assembled 246 observations of occurrence of westslope cutthroat trout (WCT), a taxon of concern in the western U. S. and Canada, in stream networks isolated for up to 100 years (median 40 years) above human-made barriers, mostly culverts, at road crossings within U. S. National Forests. We used logistic regression to analyse how WCT occurrence varied with patch size, isolation time and stream-level covariates. Occurrence was positively related to stream length and habitat quality within the isolated stream network and negatively related to elevation and channel gradient. Unexpectedly, the probability of occurrence was not related to how long a habitat patch had been isolated. At the median elevation (1354 m) and channel gradient (14%), and where habitat quality was poor, WCT were likely to occur (probability >0.5) if an isolated stream network was at least 1.7 km. If habitat quality was high, about 0.2 km of habitat produced the same probability.

The BA response variables were predicted from lidar and LandTrendr predictor variables using the random forest (RF) algorithm. RF models explained 28%-61% of the variation in BA responses. Lidar variables were better predictors of total and live BA, whereas LandTrendr variables were better predictors of dead and percent dead BA. RF models predicting percent dead BA were applied to lidar and LandTrendr grids to produce maps, which were then compared to a gridded dataset of tree mortality area derived from aerial detection survey (ADS) data. Spearman correlations of beetle-caused tree mortality metrics between lidar, LandTrendr, and ADS were low to moderate; low correlations may be due to plot sampling characteristics, RF model error, ADS data subjectivity, and confusion caused by the detection of other types of forest disturbance by LandTrendr.

In mountainous regions, representativity can be poor and lead to large uncertainties in precipitation estimates at high elevations or in areas where observations are sparse. If the uncertainty in the estimate is large compared to the long-term shifts in precipitation, then the change will likely go undetected. In this analysis, we examine the minimum detectable change across mountainous terrain in western Montana, USA. We ask the question: What is the minimum amount of change that is necessary to be detected using our best estimates of precipitation in complex terrain? We evaluate the spatial uncertainty in the precipitation estimates by conditioning historic regional climate model simulations to ground observations using Bayesian inference. By using this uncertainty as a null hypothesis, we test for detectability across the study region. To provide context for the detectability calculations, we look at a range of future scenarios from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) multimodel ensemble downscaled to 4 km resolution using the MACAv2-METDATA data set. When using the ensemble averages we find that approximately 65% of the significant increases in winter precipitation go undetected at midelevations. At high elevation, approximately 75% of significant increases in winter precipitation are undetectable. Areas where change can be detected are largely controlled by topographic features. Elevation and aspect are key characteristics that determine whether or not changes in winter precipitation can be detected. Furthermore, we find that undetected increases in winter precipitation at high elevation will likely remain as snow under climate change scenarios. Therefore, there is potential for these areas to offset snowpack loss at lower elevations and confound the effects of climate change on water resources.

The purpose of this study is to quantify historical tree spatial patterns and assess recent mortality trends for old and large tree populations in dry mixed-conifer forests of the Northern Rocky Mountains. We analyzed historical reconstructions of forest spatial structure across six 1.0 ha plots located in mixed ponderosa pine/Douglas-fir stands in western Montana, USA. Across plots, 10-23% of trees occurred as widely spaced individuals (no neighbors within 6 m), with the remaining 77-90% of trees occurring in clumps (groups of two or more trees spaced less than 6 m apart). Mean clump size was 2.2-4.2 trees per clump, although large clumps (>10 trees) were common. Global spatial analysis with the pair correlation function indicated that ponderosa pine patterns were spatially random at all scales, while Douglas-fir trees were spatially aggregated at scales less than 6 m. The proportion of plot area farther than 9 m from the nearest tree ranged from 1% to 20% across the six study plots. Mortality rates between 1991 and 2012 averaged 0.8% yr(-1) for old ponderosa pine and 2.1% yr(-1) for old Douglas-fir. We found limited evidence of density-dependent mortality for both species pooled and for ponderosa pine individually. Douglas-fir that died between 1991 and 2012 had higher local Stand Density Index (SDI) of Douglas-fir neighbors than did Douglas-fir that survived (P = 0.003), indicating conspecific density-dependent mortality. When compared to ponderosa pine and dry mixed-conifer forests in other regions, trees were distributed much more evenly across clump sizes in our Montana study sites. Our analysis provides an estimate of the historical range of variability for spatial aspects of forest structure in dry mixed-conifer forests of the northern US Rockies and is relevant to the design of restoration and climate change adaptation treatments in such forests.

We present a novel approach to elucidate regional variation in the relative importance of landscape variable effects on gene flow. We demonstrate this approach by evaluating gene flow between isolated, genetically impoverished mountain goat (Oreamnos americanus) populations in Washington and much larger, genetically robust populations in southern British Columbia. We used geneland to identify steep genetic gradients and then employed individual-based landscape genetics in a causal modeling framework to independently evaluate landscape variables that may be generating each of these genetic gradients. Our results support previous findings that freeways, highways, water, agriculture and urban landcover limit gene flow in this species. Additionally, we found that a previously unsupported landscape variable, distance to escape terrain, also limits gene flow in some contexts.

Improved prediction tools that provide high resolution spatial information are necessary for location-specific soil conservation and watershed management. However, quantifying the magnitude of soil erosion and its interactions with climate, hydrological processes, and fire occurrences across a large region (>10,000 km(2)) is challenging because of the large computational requirements needed to capture the fine-scale complexities of the land surface that govern erosion. We apply the physically-based coupled Variable Capacity Infiltration-Water Erosion Prediction Project (VIC-WEPP) model to study how wildfire occurrences can enhance soil erosion in a future climate over a representative watershed in the northern Rocky Mountains - the Salmon River Basin (SRB) in central Idaho. While the VIC model simulates hydrologic processes at larger scales, the WEPP model simulates erosion at the hillslope scale by sampling representative hillslopes. VIC-WEPP model results indicate that SRB streamflow will have an earlier shift in peak flow by one to two months under future climate scenarios in response to a declining snowpack under warming temperatures. The magnitude of peak flow increases with each higher severity fire scenario; and under the highest fire severity, the peak flow is shifted even earlier, exacerbating the effects of climate change. Similarly, sediment yield also increases with higher fire severities for both historical and future climates. Sediment yield is more sensitive to fire occurrence than to climate change by one to two orders of magnitude, which is not unexpected given that our fire scenarios were applied basin wide as worst case scenarios. In reality, fires only occur over portions of the basin in any given year and subsequent years' vegetation regrowth reduces erosion. However, the effects of climate change on sediment yield result in greater spatial heterogeneities, primarily because of the spatial differences in precipitation projections, while fire conditions were uniformly applied. The combined effects of climate change and a possible continuation of increasing fire frequency and severity will compound excess sediment issues that already exist in this region of the intermountain West.

Stand-replacing wildfires create opportunities for establishment of tree-species cohorts and can catalyze rapid shifts in where species occur, facilitating unique opportunities for long-term study. We quantified effects of multiple ecological filters on a colonizing cohort of aspen (Populus tremuloides) that established from seed throughout burned lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia) forests after the 1988 fires in Yellowstone National Park (Wyoming, USA) to ask: (1) How have aspen presence, density, and size varied across the postfire landscape, and what filters explain these spatial and temporal patterns? (2) How does aspen above-and belowground biomass vary with postfire lodgepole-pine density? Aspen persisted to postfire year 25 in 58% of the plots in which aspen were present in postfire year 11 (n = 45), and mean stem density declined from 522 to 310 stems ha(-1). Mean aspen height doubled (from 29 to 59 cm) over this period. Ecological filters related to climate, competition, herbivory, and soils all differentially affected aspen presence, persistence, and size. Growing season temperature, inter-specific competition, and herbivory also changed through time, altering their effects on the colonizing cohort, and shifting where on the landscape aspen persistence and growth were ultimately favored. Eleven years postfire, aspen were favored at warmer, low elevations; ungulate browsing strongly constrained aspen heights; and competition was unimportant. By 25-years postfire, temperatures warmed nearly 1 degrees C, and aspen were more likely to persist at cooler, high elevations. Browsing pressure declined, as ungulate populations decreased during this time, but aspen height and basal diameters were constrained by dense, rapidly growing postfire conifers. Landscape mosaics of ecological filters shift over space and time and can facilitate or constrain the persistence and growth of colonizing species. Long-term study of post-disturbance colonizing cohorts uniquely reveal how species are responding to real-time environmental change in heterogeneous landscapes, which will help us better anticipate 21st century species distributions and abundances.

Floods also strongly influence the structure and function of watersheds, stream channels, and aquatic ecosystems. The Pacific Northwest is particularly vulnerable to climatically driven changes in flood frequency and magnitude, because snowpacks that strongly influence flood generation are near the freezing point and thus sensitive to small changes in temperature. To improve predictions of future flooding potential and inform strategies to adapt to these changes, we mapped the sensitivity of landscapes to changes in peak flows due to climate warming across Oregon and Washington. We first developed principal component- based models for predicting peak flows across a range of recurrence intervals (2-, 10-, 25-, 50-, and 100- years) based on historical instantaneous peak flow data from 1000 gauged watersheds in Oregon and Washington. Key predictors of peak flows included drainage area and principal component scores for climate, land cover, soil, and topographic metrics. We then used these regression models to predict future peak flows by perturbing the climate variables based on future climate projections (2020s, 2040s, and 2080s) for the A1B emission scenario. For each recurrence interval, peak flow sensitivities were computed as the ratio of future to current peak flow magnitudes. Our analysis suggests that temperature- induced changes in snowpack dynamics will result in large (>30-40%) increases in peak flow magnitude in some areas, principally the Cascades, Olympics, and Blue Mountains and parts of the western edge of the Rocky Mountains. Flood generation processes in lower elevation areas are less likely to be affected, but some of these areas may be impacted by floodwaters from upstream. These results can assist land, water, and infrastructure managers in identifying watersheds and resources that are particularly vulnerable to increased peak flows and developing plans to increase their resilience.

Because of their connection to nearby uplands, riparian vegetation communities at these streams respond to many environmental filtersclimatic, physical, chemical or biotic factorsthat restrict what species can occur at a given location from within larger regional species pools. In this study, we examined how environmental filters originating at the landscape, watershed and reach scales correspond to riparian plant community composition across the interior Columbia and upper Missouri River basins, USA. We correlated riparian vegetation to environmental filters, identified unique communities and partitioned the variance within riparian vegetation data among filters originating at different scales. Riparian vegetation composition was strongly correlated to landscape-scale filters including elevation, precipitation and temperature. Watershed-scale filters such as grazing and reach filters indicative of fluvial setting were also correlated to vegetation composition, often differentiating communities with similar landscape settings. We identified 10 distinct vegetation communities. Forested communities occurred at higher elevation, moderate gradient reaches with high mean annual precipitation. Shrub-forb systems corresponded to fluvial and watershed disturbances and occurred within climates that could preclude forest establishment. Meadows corresponded to high water tables and/or high grazing activity. Variance partitioning showed that landscape-scale filters explained the most variance within vegetation communities. Global change will alter many of the environmental filters that drive vegetation. Vegetation change may occur rapidly if local filters (e.g. fluvial process) change rapidly or may occur more slowly if larger-order filters (e.g. climate) change slowly and without influencing local hydrogeomorphic filters. By identifying filter-vegetation relationships at large spatial scales, hypotheses can be constructed on how riparian vegetation communities may change under future environmental conditions.

Because rivers adjust their channels to accommodate their typical inputs of water and sediment, changes in these variables can potentially alter river morphology. In this study, a hierarchical modeling approach was developed and applied to examine potential changes in reach-averaged bedload transport and spatial patterns of erosion and deposition for three snowmelt-dominated gravelbed rivers in the interior Pacific Northwest. The modeling hierarchy was based on discharge and suspended-sediment load from a basin-scale hydrologic model driven by a range of downscaled climate-change scenarios. In the field, channel morphology and sediment grain-size data for all three rivers were collected. Changes in reach-averaged bedload transport were estimated using the Bedload Assessment of Gravel-bedded Streams (BAGS) software, and the Cellular Automaton Evolutionary Slope and River (CAESAR) model was used to simulate the spatial pattern of erosion and deposition within each reach to infer potential changes in channel geometry and planform. The duration of critical discharge was found to control bedload transport. Changes in channel geometry were simulated for the two higher-energy river reaches, but no significant morphological changes were found for a lower-energy reach with steep, cohesive banks. Changes in sediment transport and river morphology resulting from climate change could affect the management of river systems for human and ecological uses.

The two study watersheds are the Upper Campbell and the Illecillewaet watersheds located in British Columbia. The first watershed is a maritime watershed located on the east slopes of the Vancouver Island mountains whereas the second watershed is located in the Selkirk Mountains in Eastern British Columbia. The Canadian Climate Centre General Circulation Model (CCC GCM) has been used for the estimation of the effect of the climate change on meteorological parameters. The CCC GCM is a steady state model and the output of the 1991 run has been used. In addition to the changes in the amounts of precipitation and temperature usually assumed in hydrological climate change studies, other meteorological and climatic parameters are also considered; specifically, the effect of climate on the spatial distribution of precipitation with elevation, and also on cloud cover, glaciers, vegetation distribution, vegetation biomass production, and plant physiology. The results showed that the mean annual temperature in the two watersheds could increase by more than 3 degrees C and the annual basin-wide precipitation could increase by 7.5% in Upper Campbell watershed and by about 17% in the Illecillewaet watershed. As a result, the mean annual runoff will increase by 7.5% in the Upper Campbell watershed and 21% in the Illecillewaet basin. For the study of floods, nine flood parameters have been investigated, the total number of flood episodes, the flood days per year, the duration of flood events, the annual flood volume, the mean flood flow, the mean flood peak, the annual maximum flood peak, the day of occurrence of the centroid of flood volume, and the day of occurrence of annual maximum flood peak. These nine parameters were extracted from the hydro-graphs of the two study watersheds using the double long-term mean daily flow. The study showed that, under the climate change scenario, the floods in the maritime Upper Campbell watershed would increase, on average, in magnitude by 14%, in volume by 94%, in frequency by 11%, and duration by 44%. The timing of the floods would remain almost unchanged, and the centroid of flood volume would shift earlier by only 2 days. In contrast, in the interior mountain Illecillewaet watershed, the floods would decrease, on average, in magnitude by 7%, in volume by 38%, and frequency by 23%. The duration of flood events, under the altered climate scenario, would remain, essentially, unchanged increasing by only 2.6%. Also, the study showed that in the Illecillewaet: watershed the largest change between the altered climate and the present climate scenarios would be the timing of floods since the centroid of flood volume would occur 20 days earlier. The above changes in the flood response of the two study watersheds can be explained by the changes in the distribution and form of annual precipitation. These results indicate that different management procedures will be needed to minimize the effects of climate change on the flooding of the two climatically different watersheds and the regions that they represent.",1999,,Water Resources,WOS:000083249700005,Shana,Yes,Yes,Yes,,Selkirk Mtns,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Meghan,Yes,Yes,Yes,Selkirk Mtns,

The higher temperatures changed some snowfall to rainfall and the extra precipitation was mainly in the form of rain. The increase of the CO(2) concentration caused stomata closure that reduced evapotranspiration. This effect was compensated by increased biomass in the Upper Campbell watershed, but not in the Illecillewaet watershed. These changes produced higher flows in winter and smaller flows in summer. The largest change in the hydrograph shape was in the Illecillewaet watershed where the mean annual maximum daily flow decreased by about 13% and its frequency was reduced. On the other hand, the mean annual runoff increased by 21%.

Belt transects (1 to 17 km in length, 4 m width) along 18 foot trails were surveyed for aspen seedlings on the subalpine plateau of the Park, along gradients of elevation and geologic substrate, during the summer of 1996. Aspen seedling presence and density were characterized as a function of elevation, geologic substrate, slope, aspect, vegetation/ cover type, presence of burned forest, and distance to nearest adult aspen stand. Presence of aspen seedlings was best predicted by the incidence of burned forest and proximity to adult aspen; aspen seedlings were only found in burned forest and were more likely to occur closer to adult aspen clones. When tested against independent data collected in 1997, the logistic regression model for aspen seedling presence performed well ( overall accuracy = 73%, Tau(p) = 0.41). When present, variation in aspen seedling density at local scales (less than or equal to 200 m) was largely explained by elevation, with higher densities observed at lower elevations. At broad scales (> 1 km), seedling density was a function of cover type, elevation, aspect, slope, and burn severity, with greater seedling density in more severely burned forested habitats on southerly, shallow slopes at lower elevations. Aspen seedling densities ranged from 0 to 46,000 seedlings/ha with a median density of 2,000/ha on sites where they occurred. Aspen seedlings were most abundant in the south central and southwest central regions of the park, approximately an order of magnitude less abundant in the southeast region, and nearly absent in the north central area.

This analysis of the composite, century-scale, regional GST histories (GSTHs) is based on the deepest available borehole temperature logs from the Foreland Sedimentary Basin in western and northern Canada, east of the Cordillera. Although separated by almost 20 degrees latitude, there is strong regional correlation (r = 0.98) between the GSTHs developed from northern (boreal forest) and southern (prairie grassland) boreholes.

Strong correlation also exists between the prairie grassland GSTH curve and the tree-ring-based surface summer temperature history from the Columbia Icefield in the Canadian Rocky Mountains close to Athabasca Glacier (r = 0.95).

We reconstructed patterns of tree invasion at 17 meadow sites in the central Cascade Range of Oregon, USA - sites representing diverse physical environments and vegetation types and experiencing different histories of recent anthropogenic disturbance(sheep grazing). Spatial distributions and age structures of invasive tree populations were analysed with respect to climatic records and grazing history. Patterns of establishment varied considerably among meadows, reflecting strong differences in environment and grazing history. In montane hydric meadows, tree establishment was spatially clumped beneath large old trees and on elevated microsites; however the timing of invasion differed between sites with stable versus fluctuating water tables. in upland mesic/dry montane meadows, timing of invasion corresponded with cessation of sheep grazing (early 1940s) and the onset of wetter summers (mid 1940s). In the subalpine zone, climate and aspect interacted to produce contrasting histories of invasion on north- and south-facing slopes. Establishment on north-facing slopes, concentrated in heath-shrub communities, coincided with regional warming (ca. 1920-1945) when snowpacks were lighter and melted earlier. Recruitment of trees onto south-facing slopes occurred later, when conditions were wetter (1945-1985). In many environments, the spatial distribution of recruitment suggests that once trees have established, autogenic factors become increasingly important as individual trees or groups of trees alter the physical or biotic conditions that once inhibited establishment. Knowledge of the factors that influence invasion, and of their varying importance across gradients in environment and vegetation, is critical to predicting future changes in these dynamic systems.",1998,10.2307/3237126,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,WOS:000073995400014,Shana,No,Yes,No,,Cascades OR,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Meghan,Yes,Yes,Yes,Three Sisters Wilderness Area,

We first develop a framework of outbreak dynamics that emphasizes transitions from states dominated by negative feedback to those dominated by positive, density-dependent feedback. We then consider mechanisms by which temperature and precipitation changes can allow populations to breach critical thresholds, and the empirical data relating outbreaks to weather. Finally, we consider how anticipated climatic change, and relationships with new hosts and natural enemy guilds, may influence dynamics in new habitats. There is strong evidence that elevated temperature can increase over-wintering survival and decrease generation times of bark beetles, although evolved traits can also constrain response to warming in some habitats. Moreover, combinations of phenotypic plasticity, genotypic variation and physiological thresholds yield a broad range of conditions under which adults emerge synchronously, and thus can mass attack trees. There is likewise strong evidence that severe drought reduces tree defences against attack. Drought stress can occur through lower precipitation and/or higher temperatures that reduce soil moisture and/or raise vapour pressure deficit. We also delineate three categories of range modifications: increased and more persistent establishment in areas where trees experienced only intermittent exposure historically; establishment in areas dominated by host species but where local populations experienced little or no pressure historically; and movement into new areas containing susceptible species that have not been exposed previously. Each of these has been documented for bark beetles. Trees in areas that experienced minor or no exposure generally had lower defences than their more historically exposed counterparts. However, there can be lags in beetle behavioural responses. In some cases, more heterogeneous forest structure, more abundant local predators and competitors and low host nutritional quality could potentially lessen risk in new habitats. Direct comparative studies are needed to evaluate outbreak potentials following range expansions driven by climate warming.",2015,,Entomology; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WOS:000377029500011,Micah,No,Yes,No,,location? pure model?,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Micah,Maybe,Yes,Maybe,not sure,

Because American Pipits are obligate ground-nesters in an environment devoid of trees, I examined the hypothesis that spring snow conditions cause the annual variation in mean laying date and resulting clutch size. Mean clutch size was highly correlated with mean laying date, and both traits were highly correlated with the snow water equivalent (SWE) on I May. Reduced SWE resulted in earlier onset of egg laying and indirectly in increased clutch size. Trend analyses for 1961-2002 showed an 18% decline in I May SWE and an earlier date of snowmelt by 7 d, indicating that an earlier onset of egg laying by about 5 d may have occurred over the same period, with a corresponding increase in mean clutch size of 0.2 eggs. This result supports the global pattern for various bird species of earlier onset of nesting during the last few decades.

This paper examines the relationships among late Cenozoic fluvial incision, channel steepness, and mantle velocity domains along the western slope of the northern Colorado Rockies. New Ar-40/Ar-39 ages on basalts capping the Tertiary Browns Park Formation range from ca. 11 to 6 Ma and provide markers from which we reconstruct incision along the White, Yampa, and Little Snake rivers. The magnitude of post-10 Ma incision varies systematically from north to south, increasing from similar to 500 m along the Little Snake River to similar to 1500 m along the Colorado River. Spatial variations in the amount of late Cenozoic incision are matched by metrics of channel steepness; the upper Colorado River and its tributaries (e. g., Gunnison and Dolores rivers) are two to three times steeper than the Yampa and White rivers, and these variations are independent of both discharge and lithologic substrate. The coincidence of steep river profiles with deep incision suggests that the fluvial systems are dynamically adjusting to an external forcing but is not readily explained by a putative increase in erosivity associated with late Cenozoic climate change. Rather, channel steepness correlates with the position of the channels relative to low-velocity mantle. We suggest that the history of late Miocene-present incision and channel adjustment reflects long-wavelength tilting across the western slope of the Rocky Mountains.",2014,10.1130/GES00989.1,Geology,WOS:000339961500002,Adrienne,No,Yes,No,,,NA,,,,,,Meghan,No,Maybe,No,Coloradyo,Micah,No,Maybe,No,CO,

Despite similar climatic and topographic conditions between these ecosystems at the sites examined, lodgepole pine, and sagebrush exhibited consistent differences in water balance, notably more evaporation and drier summer soils in the sagebrush and greater transpiration and less water yield in lodgepole pine. Canopy disturbances (either fire or beetle) have dramatic impacts on water balance and availability: reducing transpiration while increasing evaporation and water yield. Results suggest that climate change may reduce snowpack, increase evaporation and transpiration, and lengthen the duration of dry soil conditions in the summer, but may have uncertain effects on drainage.

Identifying these possible diversification factors can often be accomplished under a comparative phylogeographic framework. However, comparisons suffer if previous studies are limited to a particular group or habitat type. In California, a complex landscape has led to several phylogeographic breaks, primarily in terrestrial species. However, two sister taxa of freshwater fish, riffle sculpin (Cottus gulosus) and Pit sculpin (Cottus pitensis), display ranges based on morphological identifications that do not coincide with these breaks. Using a comprehensive sampling and nuclear, mitochondrial and microsatellite markers, we hypothesized that proposed species ranges are erroneous based on potential hybridization/gene flow between species. Results identified a phylogeographic signature consistent with this hypothesis, with breaks at the Coast Range Mountains and Sacramento/San Joaquin River confluence. Coastal locations of C.gulosus represent a unique lineage, and 'true' C.gulosus were limited to the San Joaquin basin, both regions under strong anthropogenic influence and potential conservation targets. C.pitensis limits extended historically throughout the Sacramento/Pit River basin but currently are restricted to the Pit River. Interestingly, locations in the Sacramento River contained low levels of ancestral hybridization and gene flow from C.gulosus but now appear to be a distinct population. The remaining population structure was strongly correlated with Sierra Nevada presence (high) or absence (low).

We evaluated long-term trends in surface-water chemistry in the Loch Vale watershed, a 660-ha. alpine/subalpine catchment located in Rocky Mountain National Park, CO, USA. Many changes in surface-water chemistry correlated with multiple drivers, including summer or monthly temperature, snow water equivalent, and the runoff-to-precipitation ratio. Atmospheric deposition was not a significant causal agent for surface-water chemistry trends. We observed statistically significant increases in both concentrations and fluxes of weathering products including cations, SiO2, SO4 (2-), and ANC, and in inorganic N, with inorganic N being primarily of atmospheric origin. These changes are evident in the individual months June, July, and August, and also in the combined June, July, and August summer season. Increasingly warm summer temperatures are melting what was once permanent ice and this may release elements entrained in the ice, stimulate chemical weathering with enhanced moisture availability, and stimulate microbial nitrification. Weathering rates may also be enhanced by sustained water availability in high snowpack years.

Infestations of the European spruce bark beetle Ups typographus), which is the most devastating biotic disturbance agent in forests of central Europe and Scandinavia, are often triggered by storm damage. However, our understanding of spatio-temporal bark beetle dynamics at fine scales is still limited. In order to assess future risks of L typographus infestations, we analyzed spatial interactions of the infestation pattern in a 180 km(2) study region in central Switzerland. We computed neighborhood characteristics of bark beetle dispersal and fitted Poisson models to the spatial point patterns of bark beetles and storm damages. Infestations of L typographus were found to be clustered at short distances (<500 m). In contrast, the spatial distribution of storm damages followed an inhomogeneous Poisson distribution that was explained by environmental covariates. Increasing topographic exposure, south- and west-facing slopes as well as increasing proportions of Norway spruce enhanced the probability of storm damage and bark beetle infestations. Our study is a contribution towards quantifying important ecological drivers in a spatially explicit manner that helps assessing predisposing factors for future bark beetle infestations.

The Black Rock Playa in northwestern Nevada is one of the largest playas in North America and is noted for its extreme flatness, varying less than one meter across a surface area of 310 km(2). Geo-referenced Landsat imagery was used to map surface-area fluctuations of ephemeral lakes on the playa from 1972 to 2013 to provide baseline data on surface water hydrology of this system to compare to future hydrologic conditions caused by climate change. The area measurements were transformed into depth and volumetric estimates using results of detailed topographic global positioning system (GPS) surveys and correlated with available surface hydrological and meteorological monitoring data. Playa lakes reach their maximum size (<350 km(2)) in spring, fed by melting snows from high mountains on the periphery of the drainage basin, and usually desiccate by early- to mid-summer. The combination of a shallow groundwater table, sediment deposition, and hydro-aeolian planation probably are largely responsible for the flatness of the playa. When lakes do not form for a period of several years, the clay- and silt-rich playa surface transforms from one that is hard and durable into one that is soft and puffy, probably from upward capillary movement of water and resultant evaporation. Subsequent flooding restores the hard and durable surface. The near-global availability of Landsat imagery for the last 41 years should allow the documentation of baseline surface hydrologic characteristics for a large number of widely-distributed playa lake systems that can be used to assess the hydrologic effects of future climate changes.

Alluvial fans within two study areas, the Mission Creek and the Whitewater River drainages, were examined using geomorphic, sedimentological, and Be-10 terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide (TCN) surface exposure methods to define the timing of alluvial fan formation and erosion, and to examine the role of climatic, tectonic and autocyclic processes. These alluvial fan complexes were studied because they are amongst the best-preserved successions of alluvial fans in southern California and they are located at the mouths of two of the largest drainages, Whitewater River and Mission Creek, in the San Bernardino Mountains and traverse major faults, the Mission Creek and Banning. The alluvial fans comprise bouldery debris deposits that represent deposition dominated by flash flood and debris flow events. TCN surface exposure dating indicates that abandonment/incision of alluvial fan surfaces date to early in the Last Glacial or more likely the penultimate glacial cycle, to marine isotope stage (MIS) 4, and to the Holocene. The lack of alluvial fan ages during the latter part of the Last Glacial (MIS 2 and 3) suggests that there has been little alluvial fan lobe deposition/incision during that time. This is similar to findings for many other alluvial fans throughout the American Southwest, and supports the view that there is a strong climatic control on alluvial fan formation throughout this region. Furthermore, the oldest alluvial fan surfaces in the Mission Creek region are beheaded by the Whitewater River drainage, showing that the oldest alluvial fans in the Mission Creek region underwent significant capture by the Whitewater River drainage. This shows the autocyclic controls are also important on alluvial fan evolution in this region; but the importance of these processes to alluvial fan development in other regions of the American Southwest needs to be more fully assessed. The alluvial fans in the Mission Creek area traverse the Mission Creek fault, but are not deformed by it, which suggests that there may have been little if any movement along this fault since at least MIS 4. In contrast, alluvial fans in the Whitewater River study are displaced by active faults highlighting the influence of tectonism on alluvial fan development in this region. In addition to illustrating the importance of climatic controls on the development of alluvial fans in the American Southwest, a classic region for alluvial fan studies, this study illustrates the complex mixture of autocyclic and allocyclic factors that force alluvial fan development in tectonically active settings.

Increased nitrogen deposition in wetfall and changes in climate currently affect Green Lakes Valley within the Colorado Front Range. Research conducted within the alpine links chronic nitrogen inputs to a suite of ecological impacts, resulting in increased nitrate export. The atmospheric nitrogen flux decreased by 0.56 kg ha(-1) year(-1) between 2000 and 2009, due to decreased precipitation; however alpine nitrate yields increased by 40 % relative to the previous decade (1990-1999). Long term trends indicate that weathering products such as sulfate, calcium, and silica have also increased over the same period. The geochemical composition of thawing permafrost, as indicated by rock glacial and blockfield meltwater, suggests it is the source of these weathering products. Furthermore, mass balance models indicate the high ammonium loads within glacial meltwater are rapidly nitrified, contributing similar to 0.5-1.4 kg N ha(-1) to the growing season nitrate flux from the alpine watershed. The sustained export of these solutes during dry, summer months is likely facilitated by thawing cryosphere providing hydraulic connectivity late into the growing season. This mechanism is further supported by the lack of upward weathering or nitrogen solute trends in a neighboring catchment which lacks permafrost and glacial features. These findings suggest that reductions of atmospheric nitrogen deposition alone may not improve water quality, as cryospheric thaw exposes soils to biological and geochemical processes that may affect alpine nitrate concentrations as much as atmospheric deposition trends.",2014,10.1007/s10533-013-9886-5,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology,WOS:000333703400013,Adrienne,No,Yes,No,,,Paris,No,Yes,No,,CO,NA,,,,,Micah,No,Maybe,No,CO,

How have number of plant clumps and proportion of vegetation cover changed with distance from the glacier edge (i.e. till age)? Location From Tyndall Tarn to the foot of Tyndall Glacier of Mt. Kenya (0 degrees 6 ' S, 37 degrees 18 ' E), Kenya. Methods The topography, soils, vegetation and glacial distribution around the Tyndall Glacier of Mt. Kenya were investigated from 1992 to 2011. The effect of glacial retreat on the rate of movement of leading edge (upper distribution limit) of plant species was examined. The distribution of vegetation was examined in a permanent plot that was surveyed in 1996 and 2011. The effects of temperature variation on glacial retreat were assessed with a least squares regression model. Results Tyndall Glacier retreated at a rate of ~3m center dot yr(-1) from 1958 to 1997, which increased to 7-15m center dot yr(-1) between 1997 and 2011. The leading edge of Senecio keniophytum, the first pioneer species to establish after glacial retreat, advanced with glacial recession. It was sparse in 1996; by 2011, the number of clumps and proportion of cover had increased. Clump size was affected by distance from the glacier edge (i.e. till age) in areas of recent deglaciation but not in deglaciated areas >15yr old. Monthly mean minimum temperature at Mt. Kenya increased by >2 degrees C from 1963 to 2011, and glacial retreat was related to increase in monthly mean minimum temperature. Conclusion The glaciers on Mt. Kenya have diminished rapidly in recent years, and pioneer plant species have advanced in response. The movements of some species do not appear to be directly spatially related to glacial retreat but may be related to increases in air temperature, soil development, seed dispersal limitation and interval of masting.

This evidence was generated by systematic survey, sampling, and accelerator-mass spectrometer (AMS) dating of remnant Pinus albicaulis above the modern treeline ecotone of Union Peak, in the Wind River Range of western Wyoming. The survey identified 257 tree remnants, of which AMS dates were generated on 15 samples. Based on AMS results, it appears that treeline was approximately 100 m higher in elevation and covered an additional 1 km of horizontal distance for approximately a millennium, 1800-800 cal. yr BP. These findings are surprising given the tendency of remnant forests across the region to date to the middle Holocene but are consistent with regional evidence for increases in effective moisture that are contemporaneous with the Union Peak treeline advance. The age of death for most of the sampled trees occurred, however, near 800 cal. yr BP, 200 or more years prior to the onset of the type of regional and hemispheric temperature decreases that might be expected to result in treeline decline. Given the contemporaneity of the Union Peak treeline decline with a substantial regional megadrought 820-780 cal. yr BP, it is hypothesized that declining moisture availability played a fundamental role in this phenomenon. If true, the late-Holocene advance and subsequent decline of treeline on Union Peak would emphasize the role effective moisture plays in the complex interactions between temperature, precipitation, and local-scale factors conditioning treeline elevation across the central Rocky Mountain region.",2014,10.1177/0959683613516817,Physical Geography; Geology,WOS:000329828000008,Adrienne,No,Yes,No,,,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Micah,No,Maybe,No,Wind River Range WY,

This cirque was the source of a glacier valley during the Quaternary cold periods. During the Little Ice Age it sheltered a small glacier, the most southerly in Europe, about which we have possessed written records since the 17th century. This glacier still had ice residues until the mid-20th century. This ice is no longer visible, but a residue persists along with discontinuous permafrost trapped under strata of rock blocks that make up an incipient rock glacier. From 2006 to 2013, this rock glacier was monitored by measurement of the temperature of the active layer, the degree of snow cover on the ground, movements of the body of the rock glacier and geophysical prospection inside it. The results show that the relict ice and trapped permafrost have been steadily declining. The processes that explain this degradation occur in chain, starting from the external radiation that affects the ground in summer, which is when the temperatures are higher. In effect, when this radiation steadily melts the snow on the ground, the thermal expansive wave advances into the heart of the active layer, reaching the ceiling of the frozen mass, which it then degrades and melts. In this entire linked process, the circulation of meltwaters ful-fils a highly significant function, as they act as heat transmitters. The complementary nature of these processes explains the subsidence and continuous changes in the entire clastic pack and the melting of the frozen ceiling on which it rests. This happens in summer in just a few weeks. All these events, in particular the geomorphological ones, take place on the Sierra Nevada peaks within certain climate conditions that are at present unfavourable to the maintenance of snow on the ground in summer. These conditions could be related to recent variations in the climate, starting in the mid-19th century and most markedly since the second half of the 20th century.

To address this question in the Central Italian Alps, we compile a post-LIA (Little Ice Age) multitemporal glacier inventory (1860-1954-1990-2003-2007) along a latitudinal transect that originates north of the continental divide in the Livigno Mountains and extends south through the Disgrazia and Orobie ranges, encompassing continental-to-maritime climatic settings. In these sub-regions, we examine the area change of 111 glaciers. Overall, the total glacierized area has declined from 34.1 to 10.1 km(2), with a substantial increase in the number of small glaciers due to fragmentation. The average annual decrease (AAD) in glacier area has risen by about 1 order of magnitude from 1860-1990 (Livigno: 0.45; Orobie: 0.42; and Disgrazia: 0.39% a(-1)) to 1990-2007 (Livigno: 3.08; Orobie: 2.44; and Disgrazia: 2.27% a(-1)). This ranking changes when considering glaciers smaller than 0.5 km(2) only (i.e., we remove the confounding caused by large glaciers in Disgrazia), so that post-1990 AAD follows the latitudinal gradient and Orobie glaciers stand out (Livigno: 4.07; Disgrazia: 3.57; and Orobie: 2.47% a(-1)). More recent (2007-2013) field-based mass balances in three selected small glaciers confirm post-1990 trends showing the consistently highest retreat in continental Livigno and minimal area loss in maritime Orobie, with Disgrazia displaying transitional behavior. We argue that the recent resilience of glaciers in Orobie is a consequence of their decoupling from synoptic atmospheric temperature trends, a decoupling that arises from the combination of local topographic configuration (i.e., deep, northfacing cirques) and high winter precipitation, which ensures high snow-avalanche supply, as well as high summer shading and sheltering. Our hypothesis is further supported by the lack of correlations between glacier change and glacier attributes in Orobie, as well as by the higher variability in ELA(0) positioning, post-LIA glacier change, and interannual mass balances, as we move southward along the transect.",2014,10.5194/tc-8-2235-2014,Physical Geography; Geology,WOS:000347468000015,Adrienne,No,Yes,No,,,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Micah,No,Maybe,International,Italy,

Longitudinal cooling gradients have been observed during the daytime for stream reaches shaded by coniferous trees downstream of clear cuts or deciduous woodland downstream of open moorland. However, little is known about the energy exchange processes that drive such gradients, especially in semi-natural woodland contexts without confounding cool groundwater inflows. To address this gap, this study quantified and modelled variability in stream temperature and heat fluxes along an upland reach of the Girnock Burn (a tributary of the Aberdeenshire Dee, Scotland) where riparian land use transitions from open moorland to semi-natural, predominantly deciduous woodland. Observations were made along a 1050 m reach using a spatially distributed network of 10 water temperature data loggers, 3 automatic weather stations and 211 hemispherical photographs that were used to estimate incoming solar radiation. These data parameterised a high-resolution energy flux model incorporating flow routing, which predicted spatio-temporal variability in stream temperature. Variability in stream temperature was controlled largely by energy fluxes at the water-column-atmosphere interface. Net energy gains occurred along the reach, predominantly during daylight hours, and heat exchange across the bed-water-column interface accounted for < 1% of the net energy budget. For periods when daytime net radiation gains were high (under clear skies), differences between water temperature observations increased in the streamwise direction; a maximum instantaneous difference of 2.5 degrees C was observed between the upstream reach boundary and 1050 m downstream. Furthermore, daily maximum water temperature at 1050 m downstream was <= 1 degrees C cooler than at the upstream reach boundary and lagged by > 1 h. Temperature gradients were not generated by cooling of stream water but rather by a combination of reduced rates of heating in the woodland reach and advection of cooler (overnight and early morning) water from the upstream moorland catchment. Longitudinal thermal gradients were indistinct at night and on days when net radiation gains were low (under overcast skies), thus when changes in net energy gains or losses did not vary significantly in space and time, and heat advected into the reach was reasonably consistent. The findings of the study and the modelling approach employed are useful tools for assessing optimal planting strategies for mitigating against ecologically damaging stream temperature maxima.",2014,10.5194/hess-18-5361-2014,Geology; Water Resources,WOS:000347313600027,Adrienne,No,Yes,No,,,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Micah,No,Maybe,International,Scotland,

BC forest biomass has also become a major source of wood pellets, exported primarily for bioenergy to Europe, although the sustainability and net carbon emissions of forest bioenergy in general are the subject of current debate. We simulated the temporal carbon balance of BC wood pellets against different reference scenarios for forests affected by MPB in the interior BC timber harvesting area using the Carbon Budget Model of the Canadian Forest Sector (CBM-CFS3). We evaluated the carbon dynamics for different insect-mortality levels, at the stand- and landscape level, taking into account carbon storage in the ecosystem, wood products and fossil fuel displacement. Our results indicate that current harvesting practices, in which slash is burnt and only sawdust used for pellet production, require between 20-25years for beetle-impacted pine and 37-39years for spruce-dominated systems to reach pre-harvest carbon levels (i.e. break-even) at the stand-level. Using pellets made from logging slash to replace coal creates immediate net carbon benefits to the atmosphere of 17-21 tonnes C ha(-1), shortening these break-even times by 9-20years and resulting in an instant carbon break-even level on stands most severely impacted by the beetle. Harvesting pine dominated sites for timber while using slash for bioenergy was also found to be more carbon beneficial than a protection reference scenario on both stand- and landscape level. However, harvesting stands exclusively for bioenergy resulted in a net carbon source unless the system contained a high proportion of dead trees (>85%).

We used a landscape-scale model of forest succession, wildfire, and C dynamics (LANDIS-II) to evaluate the effects of a changing climate (A2 and B1 IPCC emissions; Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory General Circulation Models) on total forest C, tree species composition, and wildfire dynamics in the Lake Tahoe Basin, California, and Nevada. The independent effects of temperature and precipitation were assessed within and among climate models. Results highlight the importance of modeling forest succession and stand development processes at the landscape scale for understanding the C cycle. Due primarily to landscape legacy effects of historic logging of the Comstock Era in the late 1880s, C sequestration may continue throughout the current century, and the forest will remain a C sink (Net Ecosystem Carbon Balance>0), regardless of climate regime. Climate change caused increases in temperatures limited simulated C sequestration potential because of augmented fire activity and reduced establishment ability of subalpine and upper montane trees. Higher temperatures influenced forest response more than reduced precipitation. As the forest reached its potential steady state, the forest could become C neutral or a C source, and climate change could accelerate this transition.

We simulated the physiology of a pinon pine-juniper woodland (Pinus edulis-Juniperus monosperma) that experienced mortality during a 5yr precipitation-reduction experiment, allowing a framework with which to examine our knowledge of drought-induced tree mortality. We used six models designed for scales ranging from individual plants to a global level, all containing state-of-the-art representations of the internal hydraulic and carbohydrate dynamics of woody plants. Despite the large range of model structures, tuning, and parameterization employed, all simulations predicted hydraulic failure and carbon starvation processes co-occurring in dying trees of both species, with the time spent with severe hydraulic failure and carbon starvation, rather than absolute thresholds per se, being a better predictor of impending mortality. Model and empirical data suggest that limited carbon and water exchanges at stomatal, phloem, and below-ground interfaces were associated with mortality of both species. The model-data comparison suggests that the introduction of a mechanistic process into physiology-based models provides equal or improved predictive power over traditional process-model or empirical thresholds. Both biophysical and empirical modeling approaches are useful in understanding processes, particularly when the models fail, because they reveal mechanisms that are likely to underlie mortality.

The Tribe is dependent on various species of Pacific salmonids that inhabit the Nooksack River for ceremonial, commercial, and subsistence purposes. Of particular importance to the Tribe are spring Chinook salmon. Since European arrival, the numbers of fish that return to spawn have greatly diminished because of substantial loss of habitat primarily due to human-caused alteration of the watershed. Although direct counts are not available, it is estimated that native salmonid runs are less than 8 % of the runs in the late 1800's. In addition, climate change has caused and will continue to cause an increase in winter flows, earlier snowmelt, decrease in summer baseflows, and an increase in water temperatures that exceed the tolerance levels, and in some cases lethal levels, of several Pacific salmonid species. The headwaters of the Nooksack River originate from glaciers on Mount Baker that have experienced significant changes over the last century due to climate change. Melt from the glaciers is a major source of runoff during the low-flow critical summer season, and climate change will have a direct effect on the magnitude and timing of stream flow in the Nooksack River. Understanding these changes is necessary to protect the Pacific salmonid species from the harmful effects of climate change. All nine salmonid species that inhabit the Nooksack River will be adversely affected by reduced summer flows and increased temperatures. The most important task ahead is the planning for, and implementation of, habitat restoration prior to climate change becoming more threatening to the survival of these important fish species. The Tribe has been collaboratively working with government agencies and scientists on the effects of climate change on the hydrology of the Nooksack River. The extinction of salmonids from the Nooksack River is unacceptable to the Tribe since it is dependent on these species and the Tribe is place-based and cannot relocate to areas where salmon will survive.",2013,10.1007/s10584-013-0747-y,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,WOS:000324271700012,Adrienne,No,Yes,No,,"Not in CRB, but may be an example of the type of social science we're missing",NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Micah,No,Maybe,No,W.

Successful seedling regeneration in alpine meadows depends on availability of suitable substrates, or microsites, for seedling establishment. We sought to determine whether wood microsites (i.e., nurse logs), which are regeneration sites in Pacific Northwest subalpine forests, promoted regeneration at timberline-alpine meadow borders. To determine the ecological role of wood microsites, we examined mechanisms forming wood microsites; compared density, survival, and percent nitrogen content of seedlings growing on wood microsites to adjacent soil substrates; and compared substrate moisture, temperature, and percent nitrogen content. Wood microsites, at 13 of 14 randomly selected sites, were characterized by highly decayed downed wood (> 75% decay class five) originating from tree fall (66%), snow avalanches (17%), forest fires (15%), and by human cutting (2%). Although no differences in percent nitrogen content were detected, greater seedling densities, greater seedling survival, higher temperatures, and higher moisture contents were found on wood microsites compared to adjacent soil. We suggest that greater seedling density and seedling survival on wood microsites was associated with factors including heightened moisture and increased temperature. Assuming sustained downed wood input from timberline trees and continued viable seed input, we expect wood microsites will facilitate accelerated alpine meadow conifer invasion via wood microsites associated with climate warming.",2013,10.3955/046.087.0206,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WOS:000317114200006,Becky,Yes,Yes,Yes,Landscape/State-Province,Forests impacts due to CC in high alpine envts in northern cascades,NA,,,,,,Shana,Yes,Yes,Yes,PNW,Micah,Yes,No,No,N.

This study is designed to evaluate and enhance watershed modeling approach in characterizing climate change impacts on water supply and ecosystem stressors. Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was selected as a base model, and improved for the CO2 dependence of potential evapotranspiration and stream temperature prediction. The updated model was applied to quantify the impacts of projected 21st century climate change in the northern Coastal Ranges and western Sierra Nevada, which are important water source areas and aquatic habitats of California. Evapotranspiration response to CO2 concentration varied with vegetation type. For the forest-dominated watersheds in this study, only moderate (1-3%) reductions on evapotranspiration were predicted by solely elevating CO2 concentration under emission scenarios A2 and B1. Modeling results suggested increases in annual average stream temperature proportional to the projected increases in air temperature. Although no temporal trend was confirmed for annual precipitation in California, increases of precipitation and streamflow during winter months and decreases in summers were predicted. Decreased streamflow during summertime, together with the higher projected air temperature in summer than in winter, would increase stream temperature during those months and result in unfavorable conditions for cold-water species.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether small alpine peatlands called fens can be used as whole-ecosystem gauges of groundwater recharge through time. Fens are sustained by groundwater discharge and are highly sensitive to changes in groundwater flow due to hydrologic disturbance including climate change. Seven fens in the Sierra Nevada and southern Cascade Range were studied over a 50-80 year period using historic aerial photography. In each aerial photograph, fen areas were identified as open lawn and partially treed areas that exhibited (1) dark brownish-green coloring or various shades of gray and black in black and white imagery and (2) mottling of colors and clustering of vegetation, which signified a distinct moss canopy with overlying clumped sedge vegetation. In addition to the aerial photography study, a climate analysis for the study sites was carried out using both measured data (U.S. Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service SNOwpack TELemetry system) and modeled data (a downscaled version of the Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model) for the period from 1951 to 2010. Over the study period, the five fens in the Sierra Nevada were found to be decreasing between 10% and 16% in delineated area. The climate analysis revealed significant increases through time in annual mean minimum temperature (T-min) between 1951-1980 and 1981-2010. In addition, April 1 snow water equivalent and snowpack longevity also decreased between 1951-1980 and 1981-2010. For the fens in the Cascade Range, there were no discernible changes in delineated area. At these sites, increases in T-min occurred only within the past 20-25 years and decreases in snowpack longevity were more subtle. A conceptual model is presented, which illustrates that basic differences in hydrogeology of the Sierra Nevada vs. the Cascade Range may control the threshold at which changes in delineated fen areas are discernible. Overall, the results from this study show that fens in the Sierra Nevada have strong potential as whole-ecosystem gauges for determining long-term changes in groundwater recharge under climate change. Due to either more moderate climate change and/or hydrogeological differences, fens in the southern Cascade Range currently do not appear to have the same utility. A greater sample size of fens in the Sierra Nevada is needed to confirm the general applicability of this method. In addition, future work needs to focus on integrating fen monitoring with geochemical and/or isotopic process-level studies in order to quantify changes in groundwater recharge identified using this new approach.

We present a stochastic model that can be used to simulate the effects on physical habitat of forest fires, climate change, and other environmental disturbances that alter wood recruitment. The model predicts large wood (LW) loads in a stream as well as the volume of sediment stored by the wood; while it is parameterized to describe gravel bed streams similar to a well-studied field prototype, Fishtrap Creek, British Columbia, it can be calibrated to other systems as well. In the model, LW pieces are produced and modified over time as a result of random tree-fall, LW breakage, LW movement, and piece interaction to form LW jams. Each LW piece traps a portion of the annual bed material transport entering the reach and releases the stored sediment when the LW piece is entrained and moved. The equations governing sediment storage are based on a set of flume experiments also scaled to the field prototype. The model predicts wood loads ranging from 70 m(3)/ha to more than 300 m(3)/ha, with a mean value of 178 m(3)/ha: both the range and the mean value are consistent with field data from streams with similar riparian forest types and climate. The model also predicts an LW jam spacing that is consistent with field data. Furthermore, our modeling results demonstrate that the high spatial and temporal variability in sediment storage, sediment transport, and channel morphology associated with LW-dominated streams occurs only when LW pieces interact and form jams. Model runs that do not include jam formation are much less variable. These results suggest that river restoration efforts using engineered LW pieces that are fixed in place and not permitted to interact will be less successful at restoring the geomorphic processes responsible for producing diverse, productive physical habitats than efforts using LW pieces that are free to move, interact, and form LW jams.",2012,10.1029/2012JF002385,Geology,WOS:000311255000001,Becky,Maybe,No,No,,"Fish Trap, BC.

Presenceabsence comparisons were made at 77 sites and occupancy models were used to separate significant range shifts from artifacts of false absences. Over the past century, rising temperature pushed species upslope while increased precipitation pulled them downslope, resulting in range shifts that were heterogeneous within species and among regions. While 84% of species shifted their elevational distribution, only 51% of upper or lower range boundary shifts were upslope. By comparison, 82% of range shifts were in a direction predicted by changes in either temperature or precipitation. Species were significantly more likely to shift elevational ranges than their ecological counterparts if they had small clutch sizes, defended all-purpose territories, and were year-round residents, results that were in opposition to a priori predictions from dispersal-related hypotheses.

A monitoring network in the alpine Brighton Basin in the Wasatch Mountains of northern Utah, USA, was established to examine the relationship between air temperatures, ground temperatures, and noble gas groundwater recharge temperatures. Maximum noble gas groundwater recharge temperatures computed using the closed-system equilibration model from 25 samples collected over the 2 year period 2007 to 2009 averaged 2.9 +/- 6 1.2 degrees C, within the experimental error of the mean ground temperature of 2.3 degrees C measured within the probable recharge area. Maximum noble gas recharge temperatures vary from 0 to 7 degrees C, also comparable to ground temperature variations in the region. Groundwater ages in the collected samples vary from 0 to 7 years indicating changing flow paths to the collection site during the experiment. Mean ground temperatures in the upper 1 m of soil over the 2 year time period is 2.3 degrees C, which is 1 degrees C cooler than the mean surface air temperature extrapolated from a nearby meteorological station. This comparison contradicts an earlier observation that mean annual ground temperatures in central Utah are generally warmer than air temperatures. The offset in the Brighton Basin is explained by modeling a snow effect on ground temperature. This detailed study suggests that interpretation of groundwater recharge temperatures derived from noble gases should be attentive to the complex local ground temperature effects in the recharge areas.",2012,10.1029/2012WR012100,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Water Resources,WOS:000310072500001,Becky,No,No,No,,,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Micah,No,Maybe,No,UT,

Peatlands around the world have been exposed to anthropogenic and intermittent natural pollution through the late Holocene. This raises the question: can pollution lead to changes in the testate amoeba paleoecological record that could be erroneously interpreted as a climatic change? To address this issue we applied testate amoeba transfer functions to the results of experiments adding pollutants (N, P, S, Pb, O-3) to peatlands and similar ecosystems. We found a significant effect in only one case, an experiment in which N and P were added, suggesting that pollution-induced biases are limited. However, we caution researchers to be aware of this possibility when interpreting paleoecological records.

Here, we examine the natural range of variability in the Conejos River Valley, southern Colorado, through documentation of terrace morphostratigraphic and sedimentological characteristics as well as through investigation of sediment contributions from headwaters, hillslopes and tributary streams. Additionally, soil development and radiocarbon ages, together with local and regional paleoclimate reconstructions, were used to infer the range of processes acting in this system. Since de-glaciation, the Conejos River has fluctuated between episodes of bedrock strath formation, aggradation and vertical incision. Morphostratigraphic relationships, soil development and radiocarbon ages enable us to propose a chronology for periods of alluvial deposition (around 8.9-7.6?ka, 5.5?ka and from 3.5 to 1.1?ka), separated by intervals of fluvial incision. We infer potential forcing mechanisms by utilizing multiple working hypotheses. Specifically, we discuss the potential for increases in sediment supply during periods of (1) para-glacial adjustment, (2) climatic cooling, (3) increased frequency of climate change and (4) increased fire frequency or severity. We also consider the effects of changes in stream discharge and extreme storm occurrence. We conclude that combinations of these processes, operating at different times, have contributed to sediment mobilization since de-glaciation. Stream and landform morphology also varies longitudinally due to the influence of remnant glacial topography. In particular, valley bottom overdeepening at tributary junctions has resulted in incision and strath formation into unlithified glacial deposits (i.e. fill-cut terraces) rather than bedrock in some reaches. Overall, the Conejos fluvial system has varied significantly both temporally and spatially since de-glaciation and appears to be sensitive to changes in sediment supply related to Holocene scale climate fluctuations. This natural range of variability must therefore be a key consideration in any future stream management policies.

In contrast, at least four terraces and widespread cut-and-fill architecture in the valley floor downstream indicate multiple episodes of incision and deposition occurred during the same time interval. The upper valley fill history is atypical compared to other drainages in the Colorado Plateau. One possible reason for these differences is that a bedrock canyon between the upper and lower valley prevented headward erosion from reaching the upper valley fill. Another possibility is that widespread, sand-rich, clay-poor lithologies in the upper drainage limited surface runoff and generally favored alluviation, whereas more clay-rich lithologies in the lower drainage resulted in increased surface runoff and more frequent incision. Twenty-two dates from valley fill charcoal indicate an approximate forest fire recurrence interval of several hundred years, similar to that from other studies in juniper-pifion woodlands. Results show that closely spaced vertical sampling of alluvium in headwater valleys where linkages between hillslope processes and fluvial activity are relatively direct can provide insight about the role of fires in alluvial chronologies of semi-arid watersheds.

Developing watershed simulation models that can be run using annually-resolved proxy climate data provides a way to improve reconstructions of hydrological parameters over multi-century time scales. Through the addition of a snowmelt modeling component, we enhanced a simple water-balance model to simulate streamflow at seasonal resolution. The model was calibrated to the upper Meadow Valley Wash, Nevada, USA, using USGS gage number 09417500 streamflow records. PRISM data at 2.5 arc-min resolution were used to reconstruct streamflow at the seasonal timescale (October through May) from 1896 to 2008, with and without a temperature-index snowmelt component. Best-fit model simulations had an R(2) of 0.81 against stream gage observations. Average predicted seasonal streamflow during calibration was 0.81 cm with a standard deviation of 0.35 cm, compared to the observed average seasonal streamflow of 0.76 cm and standard deviation of 0.48 cm.

The RKT is a robust, non-parametric test that provides an increased power of trend detection by grouping data from multiple sites within a given geographic region. The RKT analyses indicated strong, pervasive trends in snowmelt and streamflow timing, which have shifted toward earlier in the year by a median of 2-3 weeks over the 29-yr study period. In contrast, relatively few statistically significant trends were detected using simple linear regression. RKT analyses also indicated that November-May air temperatures increased by a median of 0.98 degrees C decade(-1), while 1 April SWE and maximum SWE declined by a median of 4.1 and 3.6 cm decade (1), respectively. Multiple linear regression models were created, using monthly air temperatures, snowfall, latitude, and elevation as explanatory variables to identify major controlling factors on snowmelt timing. The models accounted for 45% of the variance in snowmelt onset, and 78% of the variance in the snowmelt center of mass (when half the snowpack had melted). Variations in springtime air temperature and SWE explained most of the interannual variability in snowmelt timing. Regression coefficients for air temperature were negative, indicating that warm temperatures promote early melt. Regression coefficients for SWE, latitude, and elevation were positive, indicating that abundant snowfall tends to delay snowmelt, and snowmelt tends to occur later at northern latitudes and high elevations. Results from this study indicate that even the mountains of Colorado, with their high elevations and cold snowpacks, are experiencing substantial shifts in the timing of snowmelt and snowmelt runoff toward earlier in the year.",2010,10.1175/2009JCLI2951.1,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,WOS:000277999800004,Courtney,No,,No,,Colorado,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Micah,No,Yes,No,CO,

Few F, hybrids were found, and genotype frequencies suggest strong backcrossing of hybrids to pure parental populations at both ends of the gradient. The increasing prevalence of RT alleles downstream is accompanied by a life history gradient such that RT alleles were positively associated with growth rate and negatively associated with survivorship. Although physical barriers extended the distribution of pure WCT downstream, several streams held genetically pure WCT in their uppermost reaches, even when no barriers were present. For example, RT alleles were undetectable in headwaters of Dutch Creek, which had no barriers but was very cold (average summer temperature <7.3 degrees C). We propose that RT alleles affect the choice of habitat, as well the metabolic characteristics that determine their life history and competitive abilities.

At the Niwot Ridge AmeriFlux site, a subalpine forest in the Colorado Rocky Mountains, we used a 9-year record (1999-2007) of continuous eddy flux observations to show that longer growing season length (GSL) actually resulted in less annual CO2 uptake. Years with a longer GSL were correlated with a shallower snow pack, as measured using snow water equivalent (SWE). Furthermore, years with a lower SWE correlated with an earlier start of spring. For three years, 2005, 2006, and 2007, we used observations of stable hydrogen isotopes (delta D) of snow vs. rain, and extracted xylem water from the three dominant tree species, lodgepole pine, Engelmann spruce, and subalpine fir, to show that the trees relied heavily on snow melt water even late into the growing season. By mid-August, 57% to 68% of xylem water reflected the isotopic signature of snow melt. By coupling the isotopic water measurements with an ecosystem model, SIPNET, we found that annual forest carbon uptake was highly dependent on snow water, which decreases in abundance during years with longer growing seasons. Once again, for the 3 years 2005, 2006, and 2007, annual gross primary productivity, which was derived as an optimized parameter from the SIPNET model was estimated to be 67% 77%, and 71% dependent on snow melt water, respectively. Past studies have shown that the mean winter snow pack in mountain ecosystems of the Western US has been declining for decades and is correlated with positive winter temperature anomalies. Since climate change models predict continuation of winter warming and reduced snow in mountains of the Western US, the strength of the forest carbon sink is likely to decline further.",2010,10.1111/j.1365-2486.2009.01967.x,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WOS:000274419400022,Courtney,No,Yes,No,,Western US,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Micah,No,Maybe,No,CO,

Management provisions to provide connectivity are often considered independently for aquatic and terrestrial species. Of increasing concern is that dichotomous approaches are economically inefficient and may fragment populations that rely on both water and land. To provide habitat connectivity over ridgelines for such populations, which include many species of amphibians and arthropods, we propose designation of headwater ""linkage areas."" Essentially, we propose that headwater ridgelines be managed as important ""linkage areas"" to retain forested areas for species dispersal. Our process of linkage area planning, as demonstrated for headwater streams in the Coast Range of Oregon, USA, includes considerations at three spatial scales: landscape, drainage basin, and forest stand. At the landscape scale, linking headwater drainages across 7th-code hydrologic units (HUs) is a practical design regarding landscape connectivity for headwater species. In the Coast Range, each 7th-code HU adjoins an average of six 7th-code HUs. If each of these were linked via extending buffers or alternative forest management practices, about 5000 linkage areas would be provided in the 2.3-million ha landscape. We propose that the layout of such links considers site-to-landscape scale factors including known locations of target species, existing protections, land ownership patterns, dispersal capability of species of concern, climate change predictions, and the natural disturbance regime, such as landslide prone areas for managing wood and sediment inputs to streams. Although the proposed linkage areas target sensitive headwater species by design, the resulting web of connection across the landscape can be expected to benefit a host of forest-dependent species.

The Mono responded with a risk-averse strategy composed of lowland winter population aggregation supported by logistical forays and seasonal residential dispersals to the high country, both ways of averaging variance in environmental productivity. These patterns were reconstructed using surface archaeology, GIS, and two straightforward spatial statistics, nearest-neighbor and variance-to-mean ratios, that combined provide a robust, objective picture of population aggregation and dispersal and the scale of these phenomena in different environments and seasons. These diverse strategies conform to expectations regarding the best ways for hunter-gatherers to cope with uncertainty, particularly in mountain environments. Despite this, the residentially mobile aspect of the pattern is rare in mountains and probably the result of historical connections between the Mono and Great Basin groups employing similar behaviors. Ultimately, this research suggests that climate change and environmental variability condition risk-averse, satisficing economic behaviors focused more on security than optimization, implying that pronounced environmental variability runs counter to economic intensification and its association with the evolution of more complex societies.

The dramatic landscapes associated with glaciated terrain have often led to the argument that glaciers are more erosive than rivers, and recent studies have documented the topographic signature of an ice-controlled limit of mountain height known as the 'glacial buzz-saw'(2,3). Here we present a new global compilation of erosion rates, which questions the conventional view of glaciers and erosion. In regions of rapid tectonic uplift, erosion rates from rivers and glaciers both range from 1 to over 10 mm yr(-1), indicating that both are capable of generating erosion rates matching or exceeding the highest rates of rock uplift. Moreover, a comparison of erosion rates over timescales ranging from 10(1) to 10(7) years indicates that glacial erosion tends to decrease by one to two orders of magnitude over glacial cycles, whereas fluvial erosion rates show no apparent dependence on time. We conclude that tectonics controls rates of both fluvial and glacial erosion over millennial and longer timescales and that the highest rates of erosion (>10 mm yr(-1)) generally result from a transient response to disturbance by volcanic eruptions, climate change and modern agriculture.",2009,10.1038/NGEO616,Geology,WOS:000270062200017,Courtney,No,No,No,,,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Micah,No,Maybe,No,global,

We analysed a 25-year monitoring survey of an isolated population of the Alpine whitefish Coregonus palaea. We determined the selection differentials on growth rate, the actual change of growth rate over time and indicators of reproductive strategies that may potentially change over time. The selection differential can be reliably estimated in our study population because almost all the fish are harvested within their first years of life, i.e. few fish escape fishing mortality. We found a marked decline in average adult growth rate over the 25 years and a significant selection differential for adult growth, but no evidence for any linear change in reproductive strategies over time.

The primary vehicle of this investigation is the Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics Regional Climate Model version 3 (ICTP-RegCM3), which was used to downscale the present and future climate scenario simulations generated by the NASA's finite-volume GCM (fvGCM). The present-day (1961-90; RF) simulations and the future climate change projections (2071-2100; A2) are based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. During the Northern Hemispheric winter season, the general increase in precipitation over the northern sector of the EM region is present both in the fvGCM and RegCM3 model simulations. The regional model simulations reveal a significant increase (10%-50%) in winter precipitation over the Carpathian Mountains and along the east coast of the Black Sea, over the Kackar Mountains, and over the Caucasus Mountains. The large decrease in precipitation over the southeastern Turkey region that recharges the Euphrates and Tigris River basins could become a major source of concern for the countries downstream of this region. The model results also indicate that the autumn rains, which are primarily confined over Turkey for the current climate, will expand into Syria and Iraq in the future, which is consistent with the corresponding changes in the circulation pattern. The climate change over EM tends to manifest itself in terms of the modulation of North Atlantic Oscillation. During summer, temperature increase is as large as 7 degrees C over the Balkan countries while changes for the rest of the region are in the range of 3 degrees-4 degrees C. Overall the temperature increase in summer is much greater than the corresponding changes during winter. Presentation of the climate change projections in terms of individual country averages is highly advantageous for the practical interpretation of the results.

High severity forest fire is closely linked to forest fragmentation, wildlife habitat availability, erosion rates and sedimentation, post-fire seedling recruitment, carbon sequestration, and various other ecosystem properties and processes. Mean and maximum fire size, and the area burned annually have also all risen substantially since the beginning of the 1980s, and are now at or above values from the decades preceding the 1940s, when fire suppression became national policy. These trends are occurring in concert with a regional rise in temperature and a long-term increase in annual precipitation. A close examination of the climate-fire relationship and other evidence suggests that forest fuels are no longer limiting fire occurrence and behavior across much of the study region.

Topography for idealized multiple-basin mountainous terrain is derived from geomatic data and literature values. Water table elevation, controlled by the ratio of recharge to hydraulic conductivity, largely controls the distribution of recharged water into local, regional, and perpendicular flow systems, perpendicular flow being perpendicular to the regional topographic gradient. Both the relative (%) and absolute ( m(3)/d) values of regional flow and perpendicular flow are examined. The relationship between regional flow and water table elevation is highly nonlinear. With lower water table elevations, relative and absolute regional flow dramatically increase and decrease, respectively, as the water table is lowered further. However, for higher water table elevations above the top of the headwater stream, changes in water table elevation have little effect on regional flow. Local flow predominates in high water table configurations, with regional and perpendicular flow < 15% and < 10%, respectively, of total recharge in the models tested. Both the relative and the maximum absolute regional flow are directly controlled by the degree of incision of the mountain drainage network; the elevation of mountain ridges is considerably less important. The percentage of the headwater stream with perennial streamflow is a potentially powerful indicator of regional flow in all water table configurations and may be a good indicator of the susceptibility of mountain groundwater systems to increased aridity.",2008,10.1029/2008WR006848,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Water Resources,WOS:000259993000001,Courtney,Maybe,Maybe,No,,"abstract pretty vague, 3d groundwater modeling",NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Micah,No,Maybe,No,global,

On the basis of observations of glacial morphology in the Belledonne, Grandes Rousses, Taillefer and Pelvoux-Ecrins Massifs (south-eastem France), we reconstitute the glacial trimline and Equilibrium Line Altitude (ELA) during the most extensive glaciation (MEG). Our best estimate of the MEG ELA is 1800+/-100m. Using digital elevation models, we compare our glacial reconstruction with the relief structure of nine major catchments draining the massifs. Modal elevations of the largest catchments occur at 2000-2500m and coincide with minima in plots of mean slope angles as a function of elevation. Modal elevations and slope minima occur between the modem and MEG ELAs, confirming a strong glacial imprint on relief In order to quantify glacial valley carving in the massifs, we isolated high-elevation, low-relief surfaces that form rock shoulders adjacent to the glacial valleys from a Digital Elevation Model and constructed an interpolated surface passing through these. Subtracting the present-day topography from this surface allows us to quantify the maximum glacial valley depths. Maximum valley depths determined in this manner are typically > 1000m, with spatial maxima occurring around the location of the MEG FLA in most valleys. These numbers do not take into account glacial valley widening and local glacial overdeepenings. The also neglect, however, potential pre-glacial fluvial valley incision, which could account for 20-50% of the measured valley depths. In spite of these problems, inferred valley depths are reasonably well correlated with the mean reconstructed ice thickness, and constitute about half of the sub-ridgeline relief of the studied catchments. These results lead us to propose a significant Quaternary increase in the relief of the French western Alps, controlled by climate and associated with the initiation of alpine glaciations. For reasonable values of the effective elastic thickness of the lithosphere, the isostatic response to glacial valley carving reaches values of similar to 300m across the massifs. This number is insufficient to substantially offset topographic lowering due to regional denudation, and we conclude that the isostatic response to glacial valley carving has not increased peak elevations significantly.

Since the hydrologic cycle can vary extensively on local or regional scales due to events such as such as mountain building, and since pedogenic carbonates (calcite) form in a narrow moisture regime, other proxies, such as vertebrate remains, must be used to decipher local versus regional variations in paleohydrology. In this study, the oxygen isotopic composition (delta O-18(p)) of phosphatic remains from a diverse set of vertebrate fossils (fish, turtles, crocodiles, dinosaurs, and micro-mammals) from the Mussentuchit Member (MM) of the Cedar Mountain Formation, Utah, USA (Aptian to Cenomanian) are analyzed in order to determine differences among the available water reservoirs and water utilization of each taxon. Calculated changes in water reservoir delta O-18(w) over time are then used to determine the effects of the incursion of the Western Interior Seaway (WIS) and the Sevier Mountains on paleohydrology during the MM time. Calculation of delta O-18(w) from the results of isotopic analysis of phosphate oxygen suggests that turtles and crocodiles serve as another proxy for meteoric water delta O-18 that can be used as a measure of average local precipitation delta O-18(w) similar to pedogenic calcite. Pedogenic calcites can be slightly biased toward higher values, however, due to their formation during evaporative conditions. Turtles and crocodiles can be used in place of pedogenic calcite in environments that are not conducive to pedogenic carbonate formation. Remains of fish with rounded tooth morphology have delta O-18(p) values that predict temperatures consistent with other estimates of mean annual temperature for this latitude and time. The delta O-18(p) of ganoid scales and teeth with pointed morphology, however, indicates that these skeletal materials were precipitated from water that is O-18-enriched due to migration to either evaporatively enriched water, or O-18-enriched estuarine waters of the Western Interior Seaway (WIS). Another possibility that cannot be discounted and assuming all morphological remains are from the same taxon, is that the pointed teeth and ganoid scales precipitated at different temperatures than rounded teeth. Mammal and herbivorous dinosaur delta O-18(p) suggests they primarily drank isotopically depleted river water. Coexistence of crocodiles, turtles, and mammals allows for calculation of relative humidity from site to site and these calculations suggest humidity averaged similar to 58% and ranged between similar to 42% and similar to 76%. The delta O-18(w) values estimated from semi-aquatic taxa and pedogenic calcite suggest dominance of WIS-derived moisture during their growth. Herbivorous dinosaurs particularly indicate that altitude and catchment effects from the Sevier Mountains are seemingly important for river water delta O-18(w) in the fall through early spring. These data suggest that temporal changes in the isotopic composition of the MM fauna are produced by the small-scale regressive-transgressive cycles of the WIS. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Precipitation increased abruptly 1,300 years ago. Comparing paleotemperature data from Cirque Peak, CA with paleoprecipitation data from Pyramid Lake, NV suggests that hot temperatures occurred at the beginnings of most severe droughts in the Sierra Nevada over the past 1,800 years. Severe fires and erosion also occurred at Coburn Lake, CA at the beginning of all severe droughts in the Sierra Nevada over the past 1,800 years. This suggests that abrupt climate change during the late Holocene caused vegetation and mountain slopes in some areas to be out of equilibrium with abruptly changed climates.

The 3 million ha of oak (Quercus spp.) woodlands play a critical role in California's water supply system, providing runoff primarily from winter rainfall events and hosting two-thirds of the state's drinking water reservoirs. Thus, understanding water storage and streamflow regulation by soils in these watersheds is essential for water resource planning under future climate change scenarios. The primary objectives of this research were to identify the drivers of soil moisture dynamics and the hydrologic budget at the catchment scale and their relationships with streamflow generation. A 33-ha headwater catchment in the Sierra Nevada foothills of northern California was instrumented to monitor climate, subsurface lateral flow, streamflow, and soil moisture within 100 pedons distributed throughout the catchment. A catchment-scale water balance was used to examine factors regulating spatial and temporal soil water distribution within the catchment. Relationships between soil, topographic, and vegetation characteristics and soil water content at each pedon were analyzed using a linear mixed-effects model with four fixed effects: vegetation type or cover, presence or absence of a claypan, compound topographic index, and solar radiation. Streamflow was limited to periods when lower soil horizons were at or near saturation. Following saturation, each rainfall event generated subsurface lateral flow above the clay-rich argillic horizon, resulting in sharp hydrograph responses with little base flow between rainfall events. For the two water years examined, 9.6 and 11.5% of rainfall left the catchment as streamflow. Vegetation (tree vs. grassland), presence or absence of a claypan, aspect, and compound topographic index (index of wetness) were all significantly correlated to soil moisture status and thus streamflow generation at various times throughout the year. Findings indicated that watershed-scale hydrologic models based solely on surface topography will not fully explain dynamic temporal and spatial variability in hydrologic flow paths and streamflow generation in these oak woodland catchments. In particular, watershed-scale knowledge of soil strati graphy (e. g., claypan distribution) was important for understanding catchment hydrology, especially the occurrence of subsurface lateral flow dynamics.",2011,10.2136/vzj2010.0126,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Agriculture; Water Resources,WOS:000294007600003,Danny,No,Yes,No,Landscape/State-Province,California,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Micah,No,Maybe,No,CA,

Eight fluvio-deltaic axes are present: the Rio Bravo, Rio Grande, Guadalupe, Colorado, Houston-Brazos, Red, Mississippi, and Tennessee axes. Sediment volume was calculated from digitized hand-contoured unit thickness maps using a geographic information system (GIS) algorithm to sum volumes within polygons bounding interpreted North American river contribution. General age-dependent compaction factors were used to convert calculated volume to total grain volume. Values for rate of supply range from > 150 km to < 10 km(3)/Ma.

We used a well-tested maximum entropy species distribution model (Maxent) to map the Yosemite toad (Anaxyrus (= Bufo) canorus) in the Sierra Nevada mountains of California. Twenty-six environmental variables were included in the model representing climate, topography, land cover type, and disturbance factors (e. g., distances to agricultural lands, fire perimeters, and timber harvest areas) throughout the historic range of the toad. We then took a novel approach to the study of spatially structured populations by applying the species-environmental matching model separately for 49 consistently occupied sites of the Yosemite toad compared to 27 intermittently occupied sites. We found that the distribution of the entire population was highly predictable (AUC = 0.95+/-0.03 SD), and associated with low slopes, specific vegetation types (wet meadow, alpine-dwarf shrub, montane chaparral, red fir, and subalpine conifer), and warm temperatures. The consistently occupied sites were also associated with these same factors, and they were also highly predictable (AUC = 0.95+/-0.05 SD). However, the intermittently occupied sites were associated with distance to fire perimeter, a slightly different response to vegetation types, distance to timber harvests, and a much broader set of aspect classes (AUC = 0.90+/-0.11 SD). We conclude that many studies of species distributions may benefit by modeling spatially structured populations separately. Modeling and monitoring consistently-occupied sites may provide a realistic snapshot of current species-environment relationships, important climatic and topographic patterns associated with species persistence patterns, and an understanding of the plasticity of the species to respond to varying climate regimes across its range.

Age control was provided by a paleomagnetic secular variation (PSV)-based age model for Blue Lake core BL04-4. Continuous records of delta(18)O and total inorganic carbon (TIC) generally match an earlier lake-level envelope based on outcrops and geomorphic features, but with differences in the timing of some hydrologic events/states. The Stansbury Oscillation was found to consist of two oscillations centered on 25 and 24 ka. Lake Bonneville appears to have reached its geomorphic highstand and began spilling at 18.5 ka. The fall from the highstand to the Provo level occurred at 17.0 ka and the lake intermittently overflowed at the Provo level until 15.2 ka, at which time the lake fell again, bottoming out at similar to 14.7 ka. The lake also fell briefly below the Provo level at similar to 15.9 ka. Carbonate and delta(18)O data indicate that between 14.7 and 13.1 ka the lake slowly rose to the Gilbert shoreline and remained at about that elevation until 11.6 ka, when it fell again. Chemical and sedimentological data indicate that a marsh formed in the Blue Lake area at 10.5 ka. Relatively dry periods in the BL04-4 records are associated with Heinrich events H1-H4, suggesting that either the warming that closely followed a Heinrich event increased the evaporation rate in the Bonneville Basin and (or) that the core of the polar jet stream (PJS) shifted north of the Bonneville Basin in response to massive losses of ice from the Laurentide Ice Sheet (LIS) during the Heinrich event. The second Stansbury Oscillation occurred during Heinrich event H2, and the Gilbert wet event occurred during the Younger Dryas cold interval. Several relatively wet events in BL04-4 occur during Dansgaard-Oeschger (DO) warm events. The growth of the Bear River glacier between 32 and 17 ka paralleled changes in the values of proxy indicators of Bonneville Basin wetness and terminal moraines on the western side of the Wasatch Mountains have ages ranging from 16.9 to 15.2 ka. This suggests a near synchroneity of change in the hydrologic and cryologic balances occurring in the Bonneville drainage system and that glacial extent was linked to lake size.

Large scale natural disturbances from wildfire and severe insect infestation are more likely because of warming climate and can significantly impact water quality downstream of forested headwaters regions. To investigate potential implications of changing climate and wildfire on drinking water treatment, the 2003 Lost Creek Wildfire in Alberta, Canada was studied. Four years of comprehensive hydrology and water quality data from seven watersheds were evaluated and synthesized to assess the implications of wildfire and post-fire intervention (salvage-logging) on downstream drinking water treatment. The 95th percentile turbidity and DOC remained low in streams draining unburned watersheds (5.1 NTU, 3.8 mg/L), even during periods of potential treatment challenge (e.g., stormflows, spring freshet); in contrast, they were elevated in streams draining burned (15.3 NTU, 4.6 mg/L) and salvage-logged (18.8 NTU, 9.9 mg/L) watersheds. Persistent increases in these parameters and observed increases in other contaminants such as nutrients, heavy metals, and chlorophyll-a in discharge from burned and salvage-logged watersheds present important economic and operational challenges for water treatment; most notably, a potential increased dependence on solids and DOC removal processes. Many traditional source water protection strategies would fail to adequately identify and evaluate many of the significant wildfire- and post-fire management-associated implications to drinking water ""treatability""; accordingly, it is proposed that ""source water supply and protection strategies"" should be developed to consider a suppliers' ability to provide adequate quantities of potable water to meet demand by addressing all aspects of drinking water ""supply"" (i.e., quantity, timing of availability, and quality) and their relationship to ""treatability"" in response to land disturbance.

Today, most these areas have become sensitive to human activity, prone to profound changes in land-use configuration and ecosystem services. A consensus exists amongst stakeholders that ecosystem services must be preserved but managerial strategies that help to preserve them while ensuring sustainability are often inadequate. To provide a basis for measuring implications of land-use change on carbon sequestration services, changes in land use and associated carbon sequestration potential throughout the 20th century in a rural area at the foothills of the Sierra Nevada range (SE Spain) were explored. We found that forest systems replaced dryland farming and pastures from the middle of the century onwards as a result of agricultural abandonment and afforestation programs. The area has always acted as a carbon sink with sequestration rates ranging from 28,961 t CO2 year(-1) in 1921 to 60,635 t CO2 year(-1) in 1995, mirroring changes in land use. Conversion from pastures to woodland, for example, accounted for an increase in carbon sequestration above 30,000 t CO2 year(-1) by the end of the century. However, intensive deforestation would imply a decrease of approximately 66% of the bulk CO2 fixed. In our study area, woodland conservation is essential to maintain the ecosystem services that underlie carbon sequestration. Our essay could inspire policymakers to better achieve goals of increasing carbon sequestration rates and sustainability within protected areas. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

We analyzed change in understory herb communities over a 60-y period (1949/1951-2007/ 2009) in a complex montane landscape (the Siskiyou Mountains, Oregon) where mean temperatures have increased 2 degrees C since 1948, similar to projections for other terrestrial communities.

In lower montane forests, regardless of land-use history, we found multiple herb-community changes consistent with an effectively drier climate, including lower mean specific leaf area, lower relative cover by species of northern biogeographic affinity, and greater compositional resemblance to communities in southerly topographic positions.

Although the role of historical climate change on speciation remains controversial, the impact on genetic variation within species has been well documented. We examined mtDNA sequences from the cytochrome b gene (1117 bp) and a portion of the NADH-4 gene (659 bp) for 286 individuals of Diadophis punctatus to infer phylogeographic patterns and population structure and to examine historical demographic patterns in both glaciated and unglaciated regions of North America. We inferred 14 lineages that replace each other geographically across the United States. Several of these lineages appear to be confined to specific habitats (floodplains, grasslands, montane environments) and traverse previously identified genetic barriers for terrestrial vertebrates including the Mississippi and Apalachicola Rivers, the Appalachian Mountains, and the western continental divide. We also observed overlapping ranges between some haplotype groups and several instances of secondary contact associated with ecological transition zones in eastern South Carolina, southern Oklahoma and central California. Within the US, diversification began during the late Miocene and continued into the mid-Pleistocene, suggesting these lineages pre-dated the last glacial maximum. Coalescent and non-coalescent demographic analyses indicate that independent lineages currently occupying previously glaciated or unsuitable areas in eastern, central and western US underwent post-glacial population expansion likely from southern refugia during the late Pleistocene/early Holocene. Conversely, southern lineages display patterns consistent with long-term population stability. Such long-term persistence of genetic structure may be due to the competitive effects between lineages or ecosystem stability in more southern latitudes. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

It is based on (1) local scale observations along an Inner-Alpine river called Mur, (2) an IPCC emission scenario (IS92a), implemented by atmosphere-ocean global circulation model (AOGCM) ECHAM4/OPYC3, and (3) a model-chain that links climate research to hydrobiology. The Mur River is still in a near-natural condition and water temperature in summer is the most important aquatic ecological constraint for fish distribution. The methodological strategy is (1) to use downscaled air temperature and precipitation scenarios for the first half of the twenty-first century, (2) to establish a model that simulates water temperature by means of air temperature and flow rate in order to generate water temperature scenarios, and (3) to evaluate the impact on fish communities using an ecological model that is driven by water temperature. This methodology links the response of fish fauna to an IPCC emission scenario and is to our knowledge an unprecedented approach. The downscaled IS92a scenarios show increased mean air temperatures during the whole year and increased precipitation totals during summer, but reduced totals for the rest of the annual cycle. These changes result in scenarios of increased water temperatures, an altered annual cycle of flow rate, and, in turn, a 70 m displacement in elevation of fish communities towards the river's head. This would enhance stress on species that rely on low water temperatures and coerce cyprinid species into advancing against retreating salmonids. Hyporhithral river sectors would turn into epipotamal sectors. Grayling (Thymallus thymallus) and Danube salmon (Hucho hucho), presently characteristic for the Mur River, would be superceded by other species. Native brown trout (Salmo trutta), already now under pressure of competition, may be at risk of losing its habitat in favour of invaders like the exotic rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), which are better adapted to higher water temperatures. Projected changes in fish communities suggest an adverse influence on salmonid sport fishing and a loss in its high economic value.",2007,10.1007/s00484-007-0107-6,Biophysics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Physiology,WOS:000251152300005,Meghan,No,Yes,No,,,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Micah,No,Maybe,No,Europe,

Cross-sectional areas of abandoned channels were reconstructed, and relationships derived from the modern gage records were used to estimate bankfull discharges from bankfull cross-section areas. The results indicate systematic (nonrandom) variations of bankfull floods in the northern Uinta Mountains. Large floods, as much as 10%-15% greater than modern, dominated from 8500 to 5000 calendar yr B.P., and again from 2800 to 1000 cal yr B.P. Small floods, as much as 15%-20% less than modern, characterize the periods from 5000 to 2800 cal yr B.P., and from 1000 cal yr B.P. to near present. The middle and late Holocene record of bankfull flood magnitude compares well with independent evidence for climatic variation in the area. The early Holocene record indicates that larger than modern bankfull floods coincide with warmer than modern mean annual temperature. We hypothesize that an increased range of magnitude for seasonal solar radiation during the early Holocene favored the accumulation and rapid melting of deep snowpacks in the high Uinta Mountains, thus producing large floods despite warmer mean annual temperatures. The episode of smaller than modern bankfull floods between 5000 and 2800 cal yr B.P.coincides with records of increased forest fire frequency in the northern Uintas. Larger than modern floods from 2800 to 1000 cal yr B.P. coincide with a local decrease in forest fire frequency and evidence for minor local glacial readvances.

Lowered pollen concentrations and simultaneous peaks in herbs (especially Artemisia and Poaceae), ferns, and charcoal fragments point to colder and more and climate conditions than before, with frequent fire events. Around AD 1200, regional climate became warmer and more humid than present, as revealed by an increase of Siberian pine and decreases of dry herb taxa and charcoal contents. Climatic conditions were rather stable until ca. AD 1410. An increase of Artemisia pollen may reflect slightly drier climate conditions between AD 1410 and 1560. Increases in Alnus, Betula, Artemisia, and Chenopodiaceae pollen and in charcoal particle contents may reflect further deterioration of climate conditions between AD 1560 and 1810, consistent with the Little Ice Age.

This paper examines how climate change may influence park tourism in the Rocky Mountain region by focusing on both the direct and indirect impacts of climate change for visitation to Waterton Lakes National Park (WLNP) (Alberta, Canada). A statistical model of monthly visitation and climate was developed to examine the direct impact of climate change on visitation. The model projected that annual visitation would increase between 6% and 10% in the 2020s and between 10% and 36% in the 2050s. To explore how climate-induced environmental change could also indirectly affect visitation, a visitor survey was used (N = 425). The environmental change scenarios for the 2020s and 2050s were found to have minimal influence on visitation, however the environmental change scenario for the 2080s (under the warmest climate change conditions) was found to have a negative effect on visitation, as 19% of respondents indicated they would not visit the park and 37% stated they would visit the park less often. The contrasting result of the two analyses for the longer-term impact of climate change was a key finding. The management implications of these findings and methodological challenges associate with climate change impact assessment for tourism are also discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

In riparian or streamside zones, groundwater is abundant, and we consequently predicted that temperature would limit the growth of riparian cottonwoods in a cool climate northern mountain region. To investigate this association, we analyzed tree rings of 167 black cottonwoods, Populus trichocarpa, along two adjacent Rocky Mountain creeks in Alberta. Cottonwoods were sampled from 1700 m, near their upper elevational limit, down 500 m through three progressively warmer ecoregions, the montane, aspen parkland, and fescue prairie. Across these zones, June through September mean temperatures rose from 12.4 to 16.2 degrees C (lapse rate = 0.67 degrees C/100 m), and there was subsequently a 42% increase in growing degree days (base 5 degrees C, GDD(5)) from 900 GDD5 at the trees' upper limit. Despite this variation, growth rate of most trees was fairly consistent across the ecoregions; trunk diameter versus age associations were relatively similar (r(2) = 0.85) with an estimated 14% increase in trunk sizes of 50 year-old trees with decreasing elevation. In all ecoregions, developmental patterns were prominent as annual radial increments increased up to about 20 years, and then progressively declined to an apparent lethal threshold of about 0.4 mm/year at about 100 years. Basal area increments also increased through the juvenile phase, but remained fairly constant thereafter. The weak association between growth and temperature suggests that other environmental factors limited growth rates or there were differences in temperature adaptation across these elevational ecoregions.

Multiple proxies (i.e., diatorns, pH reconstructions, biogenic silica, C/N ratios, total organic carbon) appear to sensitively track rapid limnological changes, which are associated with distinct climate intervals as inferred from other regional proxy records. The highly responsive nature of the diatom assemblages in Rock Basin Lake, relative to those recorded from nearby alkaline sites, appears to be related to this lake's limited ability to buffer changes in pH.

This event, paralleled by the destruction of the Neolithic village by fire, provoked the abandonment of this prehistoric lake-shore location established in the former shallow bay of Arbon-Bleiche, and was the last of a series of three episodes of successively higher lake level, the first occurring at 5600-5500 cal yr B.P. The dendrochronologically dated rise event was synchronous with an abrupt increase in atmospheric (14)C. This supports the hypothesis of an abrupt climate change forced by varying solar activity. Moreover, the three successive episodes of higher lake level between 5600 and 5300 cal yr B.P. at Arbon-Bleiche 3 coincided with climatic cooling and/or changes in moisture conditions in various regions of both hemispheres. This period corresponds to the mid-Holocene climate transition (onset of the Neoglaciation) and suggests inter-hemispheric linkages for the climate variations recorded at Arbon-Bleiche 3. This mid-Holocene climate reversal may have resulted from complex interactions between changes in orbital forcing, ocean circulation and solar activity. Finally, despite different seasonal hydrological regimes, the similarities between lake-level records from Lake Constance and from Jurassian lakes over the mid-Holocene period point to time scale as a crucial factor in considering the possible impact of climate change on environments.

Growing season drought stress is a common occurrence after snowmelt-derived soil water content (WC) and stream flow (Q) have declined, leading to an increase in atmospheric water demand (i.e., vapor pressure deficit, VPD). Here, we analyzed a 6-year record (2006-2011) of H2O and CO2 fluxes from the Tenderfoot Creek Experimental Forest, a montane forest in the northern Rocky Mountains to examine (1) how growing season evapotranspiration (ET), net ecosystem production (NEP), and water-use efficiency (WUE, NEP/ET) respond to changing WC and VPD, (2) how stream flow (Q), an integrated measure of catchment-level water availability, relates to NEP, and (3) how annual NEP is related to annual precipitation and the temperature-defined growing season length (GSL). Growing season NEP exhibited a linear relationship with WC and a log-linear relationship with Q, indicative of persistent water limitations when streamflow and soil moisture reach their annual minima late in the growing season. Nevertheless, years with long GSLs had relatively higher NEP, with a small net carbon sink maintained even at low levels of WC and Q, suggesting that trees are able to obtain water from deeper portions of the soil profile (>30 cm) during droughts. However, the warmer, drier climate projected for this region could bring this system closer to a critical threshold of GSL, WC, and VPD, introducing vegetation water stress that could alter the current relationship between GSL and annual NEP.

We investigated the influence of two physiographic landscapes on population structure and postglacial colonization of two white pine species of contrasting habitats: P. monticola, which occurs in the highly mountainous region of western North America, and P. strobus, which occurs in a much less mountainous area in eastern North America. METHODS: To characterize the patterns of genetic diversity and population structure across the ranges of both species, 158 and 153 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers derived from expressed genes were genotyped on range-wide samples of 61 P. monticola and 133 P. strobus populations, respectively. KEY RESULTS: In P. monticola, a steep latitudinal decrease in genetic diversity likely resulted from postglacial colonization involving rare long-distance dispersal (LDD) events. In contrast, no geographic patterns of diversity were detected in P. strobus, suggesting recolonization via a gradually advancing front or frequent LDD events. For each species, STRUCTURE analyses identified two distinct southern and northern genetic groups that likely originated from two different glacial lineages. At a finer scale, and for the two species, smaller subgroups were detected that could be remnants of cryptic refugia. CONCLUSION: During postglacial colonization, the western and eastern North American landscapes had different impacts on genetic signatures in P. monticola compared with P. strobus.

We compared scenarios of no disturbance with scenarios of MPB-caused mortality, both with and without regeneration. Results indicated that basal area and tree density recovered to predisturbance levels relatively rapidly (within 1-8 decades) in both forest types. However, convergence of the disturbed conditions with simulated undisturbed conditions took longer (12-20+ decades) and was delayed by the absence of regeneration. In MPB-affected ponderosa pine forests without regeneration, basal area did not converge with undisturbed conditions within 200 years, implying lower resilience in this ecosystem. Surface fuels accumulated rapidly in both forest types after MPB-induced mortality, remaining high for 3-6 decades in simulations.

Models of dynamic system approaches were made to understand how communities became vulnerable to global change. We evaluated the change in external pressures, such as the ability of different agro-ecosystems to tolerate climate variability, the ability of rural communities to adapt to climate variability based on their access to resources, and the institutions and policies to deal with the crisis of socio-political governance. Existing ecological and participatory research findings were reassessed along with data gathered from farming activities. We followed an iterative process explaining how external drivers led to changes in agro-ecosystem resilience, access to resources and the ability of institutions to buffer the system. Causal loop diagrams and statistical dynamic system models were used to express key quantitative relationships. Future scenarios were created to determine areas of concern most sensitive to change.

Censuses were made in three representative ecosystems: 1) Pyrenean oak woodland, 2) high-mountain juniper scrubland, 3) high-mountain summits. In a global change context, avian-community dynamics are related mainly to changes in two of the following drivers: climate change and land-use change occurring over the past 30 years. Our results show a continuous turnover of the bird community, with an overall 27% change in species composition, in an ecological setting that has changed little, especially in the high-mountain scrubland and summit areas. We detected an increase in species diversity relative to the 1980s, mostly in the Pyrenean oak woodland. Moreover, our results also show a sharp decrease in bird density during the 30-year study period, chiefly affecting the dominant species of the 1980s in the Pyrenean oak forest and in the high-mountain scrubland. In the high-summit ecosystems, the decline of alpine species has paralleled the uphill expansion of some mediterranean ones. The outcome of these processes is a community in continuous flux, both in composition and abundance, where interannual variability is similar to interdecadal variability.

We use luminescence-dated Colorado River terraces upstream of Moab, Utah, to quantify rates of salt-driven subsidence and uplift at the local scale. Active deformation in the study area is also supported by patterns of concavity along tributary drainages crossing salt structures. Subsidence in Professor Valley at a time-averaged rate of similar to 500m/Myr (meters/million years) is superimposed upon rapid bedrock incision rates that increase from similar to 600 to similar to 900m/Myr upstream through the study area.

Resource selection specialization may increase vulnerability of populations to environmental change. One environmental change that may negatively impact some populations is the broad decline of quaking aspen Populus tremuloides, a preferred nest tree of cavity-nesting organisms who are commonly limited by nest-site availability. However, the long-term consequences of this habitat change for cavity-nesting bird populations are poorly studied. 2. I counted densities of woody plants and eight cavity-nesting bird species over 29 years in 15 high-elevation riparian drainages in Arizona, USA. I also studied nest-tree use and specialization over time based on 4946 nests across species. 3. Aspen suffered a severe decline in availability over time, while understorey woody plants and canopy deciduous trees also declined. The decline of plants resulted from increased elk Cervus canadensis browsing linked to declining snowfall. 4. Woodpeckers exhibited very high specialization (>95% of nests) on aspen for nesting, and densities of all six species declined with aspen over time. Mountain chickadees Poecile gambeli and house wrens Troglodytes aedon exhibited increasingly less specialization on aspen. Chickadees strongly increased in density over time, despite a relatively high specialization on aspen. House wren densities declined moderately over time, but nest-box addition experiments demonstrated that nest-site availability was not limiting their population. House wren densities increased with understorey vegetation recovery in elk exclosures via increased generality of nest-site use, demonstrating that the decline in understorey vegetation on the broader landscape was the cause of their population decline. 5. Synthesis and applications. Management should target species that specialize in resource selection on a declining resource. Species with greater resource selection generalization can reduce population impacts of environmental change. Resource generalization can allow a species like the wren to take advantage of habitat refuges, such as those provided by the elk exclosures. Yet, resource generalization cannot offset the negative impacts of broad-scale declines in habitat quality on the landscape, as demonstrated by the general decline of wrens. Ultimately, aspen is an important habitat for biodiversity, and land management programmes that protect and aid recovery of aspen habitats may be critical.",NA,,,,Micah,No,Yes,No,,AZ,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Micah,No,Yes,No,AZ,

We use a combination of phylogeographic inference, demographic reconstructions, and hierarchical Approximate Bayesian Computation to test for phylodemographic concordance among five species of alpine-adapted small mammals in eastern Beringia. These species (Collared Pikas, Hoary Marmots, Brown Lemmings, Arctic Ground Squirrels, and Singing Voles) vary in specificity to alpine and boreal-tundra habitat but share commonalities (e.g., cold tolerance and nunatak survival) that might result in concordant responses to Pleistocene glaciations. All five species contain a similar phylogeographic disjunction separating eastern and Beringian lineages, which we show to be the result of simultaneous divergence. Genetic diversity is similar within each haplogroup for each species, and there is no support for a post-Pleistocene population expansion in eastern lineages relative to those from Beringia. Bayesian skyline plots for four of the five species do not support Pleistocene population contraction. Brown Lemmings show evidence of late Quaternary demographic expansion without subsequent population decline. The Wrangell-St. Elias region of eastern Alaska appears to be an important zone of recent secondary contact for nearctic alpine mammals. Despite differences in natural history and ecology, similar phylogeographic histories are supported for all species, suggesting that these, and likely other, alpine-and arctic-adapted taxa are already experiencing population and/or range declines that are likely to synergistically accelerate in the face of rapid climate change. Climate change may therefore be acting as a double-edged sword that erodes genetic diversity within populations but promotes divergence and the generation of biodiversity.",2015,10.1371/journal.pone.0118396,Science & Technology - Other Topics,WOS:000350314700025,Micah,No,Yes,No,,Northern BC,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Micah,No,Maybe,No,N.

The impact of uncertainties in the forcing irradiances on simulations of snow is evaluated in idealized modeling experiments. Two snow models of contrasting complexity, the Utah Energy Balance Model (UEB) and the Snow Thermal Model (SNTHERM), are forced with irradiances with prescribed errors of the structure and magnitude representative of those found in methods for estimating the downwelling irradiances. Relatively modest biases have substantial impacts on simulated snow water equivalent (SWE) and surface temperature (T-s) across a range of climates, whereas random noise at the daily scale has a negligible effect on modeled SWE and T-s. Shortwave biases have a smaller SWE impact, due to the influence of albedo, and T-s impact, due to their diurnal cycle, compared to equivalent longwave biases. Warmer sites exhibit greater sensitivity to errors when evaluated using SWE, while colder sites exhibit more sensitivity as evaluated using T-s. The two models displayed different sensitivity and responses to biases. The stability feedback in the turbulent fluxes explains differences in T-s between models in the negative longwave bias scenarios.

However, this ""policy window"" explanation disregard the relationship between the performative meaning of AM in its social and ecological context, and masks the actual politics of the discursive practices enlisting particular actor-networks in the western larch AM policy process. My analysis suggests that the western larch AM policy emerged from the relationship of specific policy actors with specific non-humans actors including exotic and invasive species. Yet, aware of potential political risks of deploying this controversial practice, policy actors in British Columbia carefully circumscribed the purpose of western larch AM, distancing the western larch AM policy from exotic and invasive species. Additionally, western larch AM was framed as a natural extension of current tree regeneration standards and best practices in BC thus seemingly representing ""business as usual"", rather than a major reassemblage of the actor-networks structuring forest policy in BC. Comparing western larch policy discourses to policy discourses on AM in other provinces suggest that the differences in what actor-networks are enlisted largely explains why no other province in Canada has yet to develop an assisted migration policy. The policy implications of this study are that in the composition of Canada's future forests we should keep exotic and invasive species present in view. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We used the Basin Characterization Model (BCM), a regional water balance model to (1) ask what is the magnitude of historical and projected future change in the hydrology of California's watersheds; (2) test the spatial congruence of watersheds with the most historical and future hydrologic change; and (3) identify watersheds with high levels of hydrologic change under drier and wetter future climates. We assessed change for 5135 watersheds over a 60-year historical period and compared it to 90-year future projections. Watershed change was analyzed for climatic water deficit, April 1st snowpack, recharge, and runoff. Watersheds were ranked by change for the historical and two future scenarios. We developed a normalized index of hydrologic change that combined the four variables, and identified which watersheds show the most spatial congruence of large historical change and continued change under the two futures. Of the top 20% of all watersheds (1028), 591 in the Sierra Nevada Mountains and Northwestern ecoregions have high spatial congruence across all time periods. Among watersheds where change accelerates in the future, but not historically, a majority are congruent between both climate models, predominantly in the Sierra Nevada, Cascade Ranges and the Northwestern ecoregions. This congruence of impacts in watersheds under drier or wetter scenarios is driven by snowpack, but in areas with low snowpack, hydrologic change varied spatially depending on projected precipitation and temperature, with 151 watersheds in Northwestern California showing high levels of drying under the drier scenario, while 103 watersheds in Central western and Southwestern California show increasing hydrologic activity under the wetter scenario. In some regions, the loss of snowpack allows the cycle of runoff and recharge to function without delay represented by springtime snow melt, causing these watersheds to become more immediately hydrologically responsive to changing climate. The study also found watersheds with low rainfall that have already passed through their highest response to changing climate, and show less future change. The methods used here can also be used to identify watersheds resilient to changing climate.",2015,10.1890/ES14-00300.1,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WOS:000350441300004,Micah,No,Yes,No,,CA,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Micah,No,Maybe,No,CA,

Recent studies have proposed that stream thermal sensitivities, derived from short-term air temperature variations, can be employed to infer future stream warming due to long-term climate change. However, this approach does not consider the potential for streambed heat fluxes to increase due to gradual warming of the shallow subsurface. The temperature of shallow groundwater is particularly important for the thermal regimes of groundwater-dominated streams and rivers. Also, recent studies have investigated how land surface perturbations, such as wildfires or timber harvesting, can influence stream temperatures by changing stream surface heat fluxes, but these studies have typically not considered how these surface disturbances can also alter shallow groundwater temperatures and streambed heat fluxes. In this study, several analytical solutions to the one-dimensional unsteady advection-diffusion equation for subsurface heat transport are employed to estimate the timing and magnitude of groundwater temperature changes due to seasonal and long-term variability in land surface temperatures. Groundwater thermal sensitivity formulae are proposed that accommodate different surface warming scenarios. The thermal sensitivity formulae suggest that shallow groundwater will warm in response to climate change and other surface perturbations, but the timing and magnitude of the subsurface warming depends on the rate of surface warming, subsurface thermal properties, bulk aquifer depth, and groundwater velocity. The results also emphasize the difference between the thermal sensitivity of shallow groundwater to short-term (e.g., seasonal) and long-term (e.g., multi-decadal) land surface-temperature variability, and thus demonstrate the limitations of using short-term air and water temperature records to project future stream warming.

Topographically complex regions have strong environmental gradients and heterogeneous habitats that result in fragmented geographic ranges over long periods and may promote speciation. In order to evaluate the influence of topography and climate on mammal diversification, we traced the history of mammal diversity during the formation of basin-and-range topography. We compiled species-occurrence data from the NeoMap database of fossil mammals and calculated standing diversity, origination rate, extinction rate, diversification rate (originations - extinctions), and turnover rate (originations + extinctions) for million-year intervals. We evaluated changes in faunalcomposition (species in mammalian orders and species in rodent families) over time and assessed whether significant changes in diversity and faunal composition tracked major changes in landscape history. Neogene geologic evolution generated by tectonic activity and changing climate created the topographic complexity and habitat heterogeneity of the Great Basin. Over the last 30 million years, extensional tectonic processes caused an older high plateau to collapse and stretch from east to west, resulting in longitudinal expansion by similar to 235 km to form the Great Basin. Average elevation decreased by 1-3 km. Global warming and associated increases in regional precipitation from 17 to 14 million years ago (mya; the Miocene Climatic Optimum [MCO]) interrupted the long-term trend of Cenozoic cooling and aridification. From 30 to 2 mya, Great Basin mammal diversity peaked during the MCO, then declined over the later Miocene and Pliocene. The major changes in diversity over time were robust to sampling effects. Faunal composition changed episodically, with increasing proportions of rodents, lagomorphs, and carnivores and decreasing proportions of ungulates and proboscideans. The highest diversification rate occurred during the MCO with smaller but significant diversification rates later in the Neogene. The highest turnover rates occurred during and immediately following the MCO. Comparison of rodent faunas of the Great Basin and the Great Plains showed substantial differences in the timing and magnitude of diversification and changes in taxonomic composition. These patterns support the hypothesis that climate change over complex topography stimulated diversification in the Great Basin.",2014,10.1644/13-MAMM-S-088,Zoology,WOS:000347399700002,Micah,No,Yes,No,Landscape/State-Province,Great Basin (duplicate),NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Micah,No,Maybe,No,Great Basin,

Sediment cores were recovered from six high-elevation lakes in the central Great Basin of the United States. The proxies utilized to examine the degree of recent anthropogenic environmental change include spheroidal carbonaceous particle (SCP), mercury (Hg), and sediment organic content estimated using loss-on-ignition. Chronologies for the sediment cores, developed using Pb-210, indicate the cores span the twentieth century. Mercury flux varied between lakes but all exhibited increasing fluxes during the mid-twentieth century. The mean ratio of modern (post-A.D. 1985) to preindustrial (pre-A.D. 1880) Hg flux was 5.2, which is comparable to the results from previous studies conducted in western North America. Peak SCP flux for all lakes occurred between approximately A.D. 1940 and A.D. 1970, after which time the SCP flux was greatly reduced. The reduction in SCP input is likely due to better controls on combustion sources. Measured Hg concentrations and calculated sedimentation rates suggest atmospheric Hg flux increased in the early 1900s, from A.D. 1920 to A.D. 1990, and at present. Atmospheric deposition is the primary source of the anthropogenic inputs of Hg and SCPs to these high elevation lakes. The input of SCPs, which is largely driven by regional sources, has declined with the implementation of national pollution control regulations.

This is double the previous hillslope volume when normalized by study area, demonstrating that landslide-prone catchments disproportionately contribute to the terrestrial post-LGM sediment budget.

These changes can also impact the essential ecosystem goods and services derived from these ecosystems. Following disturbances, remote-sensing datasets have been used to monitor the disturbance and describe antecedent conditions as a means of understanding vulnerability to change. To a lesser extent, they have also been used to predict when desired ecosystems are vulnerable to degradation or loss. In this paper, we review studies that have applied remote sensing imagery to characterize vegetation vulnerability in both retrospective and prospective modes. We first review vulnerability research in natural terrestrial ecosystems including temperate forests, tropical forests, boreal forests, semi-arid lands, coastal areas, and the arctic. We then evaluate whether remote sensing can evaluate vulnerability sufficiently in advance of future events in order to allow the implementation of mitigation strategies, or whether it can only describe antecedent conditions a posteriori. The majority of existing research has evaluated vulnerability retrospectively, but key studies highlight the considerable potential for the development of early warnings of future vulnerability. We conclude that future research needs to focus on the development of a greater number of remotely sensed metrics to be used in a prospective mode in assessing vulnerability of terrestrial vegetation under change.

A complementary experimental manipulation examined the effects of flow on growth rate across a discharge gradient in riffle and pool habitats. We found that low-velocity habitats and decreased discharge in experimental channels result in reduced dace growth and that decreasing stream flow was coincident with declines in Nooksack dace abundance. This study demonstrates the sensitivity of Nooksack dace to hydrological drought, and insofar as Nooksack dace are ecologically typical of small riffle-dwelling invertivore fishes, our results suggest that use of pools does not mitigate sublethal effects of declining flows on growth, although pools may provide refuge from the most negative effects of drought (i.e., stranding of fish).",2014,10.1139/cjfas-2013-0585,Fisheries; Marine & Freshwater Biology,WOS:000344604800003,Micah,No,Yes,No,,coastal WA/BC,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Micah,No,Maybe,No,Coastal WA/BC,

Large ice advances also occurred during MIS-2 (at similar to 23 and 17-16 ka), but these advances did not exceed the limits reached during MIS-3. The results indicate that climatic conditions during MIS-3, characterized by a cool-wet climate with a greater-than-today input from winter precipitation, generated the most favorable setting for glaciation in the study region. Yet, glacial accumulation also responded positively to the far colder and drier conditions of MIS-2, and again during the last glacial-interglacial transition when precipitation levels increased.

The dataset includes 275 time series of glacier fluctuations based on historical, tree ring, lake sediment, radiocarbon and terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide data. The most detailed and reliable series for individual glaciers and regional compilations are compared with summer temperature and, when available, winter precipitation reconstructions, the most important parameters for glacier mass balance. In many cases major glacier advances correlate with multi-decadal periods of decreased summer temperature. In a few cases, such as in Arctic Alaska and western Canada, some glacier advances occurred during relatively warm wet times. The timing and scale of glacier fluctuations over the past two millennia varies greatly from region to region. However, the number of glacier advances shows a clear pattern for the high, mid and low latitudes and, hence, points to common forcing factors acting at the global scale. Globally, during the first millennium CE glaciers were smaller than between the advances in 13th to early 20th centuries CE. The precise extent of glacier retreat in the first millennium is not well defined; however, the most conservative estimates indicate that during the 1st and 2nd centuries in some regions glaciers were smaller than at the end of 20th/early 21st centuries. Other periods of glacier retreat are identified regionally during the 5th and 8th centuries in the European Alps, in the 3rd-6th and 9th centuries in Norway, during the 10th-13th centuries in southern Alaska, and in the 18th century in Spitsbergen. However, no single period of common global glacier retreat of centennial duration, except for the past century, has yet been identified. In contrast, the view that the Little Ice Age was a period of global glacier expansion beginning in the 13th century (or earlier) and reaching a maximum in 17th-19th centuries is supported by our data. The pattern of glacier variations in the past two millennia corresponds with cooling in reconstructed temperature records at the continental and hemispheric scales. The number of glacier advances also broadly matches periods showing high volcanic activity and low solar irradiance over the past two millennia, although the resolution of most glacier chronologies is not enough for robust statistical correlations. Glacier retreat in the past 100-150 years corresponds to the anthropogenic global temperature increase. Many questions concerning the relative strength of forcing factors that drove glacier variations in the past 2 ka still remain. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

An improved understanding of the occurrence of this process is essential so as to be able to design reliable disaster risk reduction strategies, even more so in view of ongoing climate change and scenarios of future evolutions. Here, we apply a dendrogeomorphic approach to reconstruct past debris-flow activity on the Aksay cone (Ala-Archa valley, Kyrgyz range), where outbursting glacier lakes and intense rainfalls have triggered huge debris flows over the past decades. A total of 96 Picea abies (L.) Karst. trees growing on the cone and along the main channel have been selected based on the evidence of past debris-flow damage in their trunks; these trees were then sampled using increment borers. The dating of past events was based on the assessment of growth disturbances (GD) in the tree-ring records and included the detection of injuries, tangential rows of traumatic resin ducts, reaction wood, and abrupt growth changes. In total, 320 GD were identified in the tree-ring samples. In combination with aerial imagery and geomorphic recognition in the field, reactions in trees and their position on the cone have allowed reconstruction of the main spatial patterns of past events on the Aksay cone. Our findings suggest that at least 27 debris flows have occurred on the site between 1877 and 2015 and point to the occurrence of at least 17 events that were not documented prior to this study. We also observe high process activity during the 1950s and 1960s, with major events on the cone in 1950, 1966, and 1968, coinciding with phases of slight glacier advance. The spatial analyses of events also point to two different spatial patterns, suggesting that quite dissimilar magnitudes probably occurred during glacier lake outburst floods and rainfall induced debris-flow events. The results presented here represent the longest, annually resolved GLOF series in the region, which in turn has key implications on risk assessment, not just in the Ala-Archa valley, but also in the entire Kyrgyz range (northern Tien Shan).

We examined spatial variation in female-biased sex ratios in the mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) outbreak in western Canada to better understand how environmental context affects sex ratio skew. Our specific objectives were to: 1) characterize spatial variation in mountain pine beetle sex ratio; 2) test previously asserted hypotheses that beetle sex ratio varies with tree diameter and year in outbreak; and 3) develop predictive models of sex ratio skew for larval and adult populations. Using logistic regression, we modeled the probability that an individual beetle (n = 2,369) was female as a function of multiple environmental variables across 34 stands in British Columbia and Alberta, Canada. We identified a consistent female-biased sex ratio with significantly greater skew in adults (2: 1, n = 713) than in larvae (1.76: 1, n = 1,643). We found that the proportion of larval females increased with decreasing tree size and with outbreak age. However, adults did not respond to tree size and larvae did not respond to outbreak age. Predictive models differed between larvae and adults. All identified models perform well and included predictors related to weather, tree diameter, and year in outbreak. Female-biased sex ratios appear to originate from differential male mortality during development rather than from sex-biased oviposition, suggesting sex ratio skew is not the cause of outbreaks, but rather a consequence.",2016,10.1093/ee/nvw048,Entomology,WOS:000381911600004,Paris,Yes,No,No,,does not address climate change,Courtney,Yes,No,No,Biome/National,"Western Canada, pine beetle",NA,,,,,Micah,Yes,No,No,BC/Alberta,

Knowledge concerning these disturbances is especially limited for larger streams where warm water species dominate. Fire-related disturbances have been hypothesised to differentially affect native and non-native fishes, although this hypothesis has only been tested for salmonids. The objective of our research was to contrast effects of uncharacteristically large wildfires followed by flooding on metapopulations of native and non-native fishes in the Gila River of southwest New Mexico. Probabilities of occupancy, colonisation and local extinction of fishes were calculated across sites before and during disturbance and were also measured across a broader spatial scale during disturbance to identify potential refuge locations. Occupancy was higher for native fishes than non-natives, but multiple wildfire and flood events increased extinction probabilities of native species. Responses of non-native species to wildfires were mixed; extinction of non-native salmonids increased during disturbance, while extinction of several warm water species remained unchanged or decreased. Several undisturbed sites were poor refugia for natives as they were impacted by non-native piscivores, dewatering, and fragmentation. However, despite exposure to multiple disturbances, sites located in large tributary and valley reaches were consistently occupied by native species, suggesting these habitats provided refugia. We suggest that management actions (forest thinning; prescribed burning) that restore a more natural disturbance regime of small and less severe fires coupled with habitat remediation activities (non-native removal; decreased water withdrawal; improved connectivity) might diminish extinction risk for native fishes exposed to wildfire disturbance.",2016,10.1111/eff.12217,Fisheries; Marine & Freshwater Biology,WOS:000378625100004,Paris,No,Yes,No,,NM,NA,,,,,,Danny,No,Maybe,No,Gila River- SW New Mexico,Micah,No,Maybe,No,NM,

During the 1990s, a massive spruce bark beetle (Dendroctonus rufipennis) outbreak took place in boreal spruce forest on the Kenai Peninsula, Alaska allowing us to ask (1) How did the extent and duration of bark beetle outbreak differ between a homogenous landscape dominated by white spruce (Picea glauca), and a landscape in which white spruce and black spruce (Picea mariana) were intermixed? (2) How has the occurrence and duration of bark beetle outbreak influenced the likelihood of subsequent burning in these two landscapes? Forest landscape structure had a substantial effect on disturbance patterns and interactions between disturbances in this study. The spruce bark beetle outbreak was smaller in extent and duration where white spruce, the beetle's primary host tree, was intermixed with more beetle-resistant black spruce. However, likelihood of subsequent burning increased where outbreak did occur. Surface fuel loads increased substantially in this landscape following the outbreak, potentially increasing the flammability of white spruce where they once served as fire breaks. In contrast, the outbreak was larger and lasted longer in the landscape with homogeneous stands of white spruce, but was not related to likelihood of subsequent burning, which is consistent with the fire history. Our results suggest that bark beetle outbreaks may have different effects on subsequent patterns of burning than in other systems, such as the Rocky Mountains. These results could inform more effective and targeted management strategies to ameliorate fire risk in beetle-killed stands of Alaska and may help us anticipate the dynamics and consequences of future boreal bark beetle outbreaks as climate warms at high latitudes.

New and updated tree-ring chronologies help reconstructed the water-year (October September) streamflow for the Aksu River, which is an important river at the edge of the Taklimakan Desert that drains into the Tarim Basin. The reconstruction dates back to 1692 and has an adjusted r(2) of 0.61 (1957-2006). Based on frequency, intensity and duration of droughts and pluvial events, the lowest streamflows occurred in the 1920s. Since then streamflow has continuously increased, and was exceptionally rapidly after the 1960s, until today. The start and end of the 20th century to the present were the highest streamflow periods. The mid-20th century was the longest and driest period over the past 300 yr. The reconstructed streamflow series has a strong positive correlation with the North Atlantic Oscillation Index. Changes in mid-latitude circulation patterns influencing precipitation may have indirectly resulted in streamflow variations along the Aksu River over the past 300 yr. The rapid increase and the exceptional streamflows of the 1960s are likely linked with global warming and mid-latitude atmospheric circulation changes. (C) 2016 University of Washington.

We tested this hypothesis by investigating historic trends in magnitudes, durations and timing of the annual peak flows of rivers that drain the Rocky Mountains around the North American hydrographic apex, the source for rivers flowing to the Pacific, Arctic (including Hudson Bay) and Atlantic Oceans. We sought century-long records and to reduce influences from land-use we assessed drainages from parks and protected areas. Of 30 rivers and reaches that were free-flowing or slightly regulated, seven displayed declining peak flows (7 p < 0.1, 4 p < 0.05), and one showed increase (p < 0.05); three of five moderately regulated rivers displayed decline (p < 0.05). Substantial floods, exceeding the 1-in-5 year recurrence (Q(5)), were more common in the early versus latter halves of the records for some Arctic drainages and were more common during the Pacific Decadal Oscillation negative phase for all regions. The timing of peak flows was relatively unchanged and Q(5) flood durations declined for a few rivers. These results indicate flood moderation rather than flood intensification, particularly for Arctic Ocean drainages. This could reflect regional hydrological consequences from climate change including: (1) declining overall annual river flows; (2) winter warming that would increase the rain versus snow proportion, thus reducing snow accumulation and melt; and (3) spring warming that advances snow melt, lengthening the melt interval before peak flows. These changes would shift the seasonality of river flows and reduce annual peaks. We might expect continuing moderation of peak flows but there will probably still be occasional major floods from exceptional rain events such as occurred in northern Montana in 1964 and in southern Alberta in 2013.

Interest in this enigmatic group of snakes continues to accrue due, in part, to their ecomorphological diversity, contributions to global envenomations, and potential medicinal importance. Although the group has garnered substantial attention from systematists and evolutionary biologists for decades, little is still known regarding patterns of lineage diversification. In addition, few studies have statistically quantified broad-scale biogeographic patterns in rattlesnakes to ascertain how dispersal occurred throughout the New World, particularly among the different major biomes of the Americas. To examine diversification and biogeographic patterns in this group of snakes we assemble a multilocus data set consisting of over 6700 bp encompassing three nuclear loci (NT-3, RAG-1, C-mos) and seven mitochondria] genes (12S, 16S, ATPase6, ATPase8, ND4, ND5, cytb). Fossil-calibrated phylogenetic and subsequent diversification rate analyses are implemented using maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference, to examine their evolutionary history and temporal dynamics of diversity. Based on ancestral area reconstructions we explore dispersal patterns throughout the New World. Cladogenesis occurred predominantly during the Miocene and Pliocene with only two divergences during the Pleistocene. Two different diversification rate models, advocating diversity dependence, are strongly supported. These models indicate an early rapid radiation followed by a recent speciation rate decline. Biogeographic analyses suggest that the high elevation pine-oak forests of western Mexico served as a major speciation pump for the majority of lineages, with the desert biome of western North America colonized independently at least twice. All together, these results provide evidence for rapid diversification of rattlesnakes throughout the Mexican highlands during the Neogene, likely in response to continual orogenesis of Mexico's major mountain systems, followed by more recent dispersal into desert and tropical biomes.

Such browning affects aquatic food webs and biodiversity in multiple ways, not least through increased attenuation of short-wave UV radiation, which may facilitate establishment of new predators. We examined the effects of browning on occurrence of the predatory larvae of the phantom midge, Chaoborus nyblaei, and quantified their impact on the Arctic fairy shrimp Branchinecta paludosa in ponds in alpine southern Norway. The predator was present only above certain levels of DOC (here represented by total organic carbon, TOC). Comet assays revealed a 50-fold higher DNA damage in the population inhabiting a clearwater pond (3.9mg TOCL-1), compared to that from a brownwater site (10.5mg TOCL-1). Laboratory experiments corroborated the key role of browning in protection against UV-related DNA damage.Chaoborus nyblaei was a highly effective predator on B.paludosa, which suffered major population declines in ponds where the predator was present. Indeed, extinction of B.paludosa has been observed at lower altitudes of the surveyed area over the past decades, possibly in parallel with warming and increased vegetation cover, as inferred from analyses of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for the surveyed area. These shifts could clearly have favoured establishment of C.nyblaei in the region. Our results point to climate-induced cascading effects in alpine ponds, whereby increased warming and terrestrial C-fixation cause increased catchment export of DOC, leading to increased browning of water and associated food-web changes.",2016,10.1111/fwb.12712,Marine & Freshwater Biology,WOS:000369742200007,Paris,No,,No,,Norway,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Micah,Maybe,Maybe,No,Norway,

We used dendrochronology to reconstruct fire history and assess forest dynamics at 29 sites in the montane forests.

Lodgepole pine, hybrid spruce and Douglas-fir established simultaneously after low-and high-severity fires. Regardless of fire history, forest canopies were mixed in composition and subcanopies were strongly dominated by shade-tolerant hybrid spruce. Despite their size, subcanopy trees were similar in age to the canopy trees. Current stand composition and age structures largely reflect the effects of high-severity fires that burned, 110 years ago at 18 of 29 sites. In the absence of fires after 1905, forests have matured simultaneously, homogenising the landscape and resulting in forest structures that are more conducive to high-severity fire than are fires of a range of severities.

Beetles contend with these challenges by using multiple, integrated sensory modalities, and sequential decision making. They incorporate both negative and positive information at multiple scales to locate susceptible hosts across large and heterogeneous landscapes. Some of the olfactory sensory neurons that convey non-host signals are relatively broadly tuned, whereas those that underlie intraspecific communication and host quality assessment are more specific, an arrangement that maximizes the use of antennal space while retaining high fidelity of detection channels strongly linked to survival and reproduction. The pertinent co-localization of neurons within sensilla provides the means for odour mixture processing in the periphery and enhances odour source discrimination and evaluation of chemical ratios in host tissue. Bark beetles show high behavioural plasticity in their orientation sequences, which allows them to adjust to environmental variability. This plasticity is modulated by environmental, genetic, and gene x environment drivers. Behavioural plasticity allows individuals to best realize the benefits that can be derived from pheromone-mediated cooperative attacks when populations are high. Cross-scale linkages among neurons, sensilla, orientation sequences, populations, and habitat structure underlie the landscape-scale environmental and socioeconomic impacts bark beetles exert. They also underlie rapid outbreaks in response to human-induced environmental alterations, such as climate change, habitat manipulation, and global transport.",2016,10.1016/bs.aiip.2016.02.001,Entomology,WOS:000381940400002,Paris,No,No,No,,No geography,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Micah,No,No,No,no location?,

This suggests that both loess and paleosol units have preserved their primary Ca-bearing plagioclase compositions of loess source regions. Weighted average CaO (%) in Ca-bearing plagioclase lies within a narrow range and is equivalent to the average plagioclase composition for upper continental crust. This fact supports the hypothesis that Chinese loess deposits are the result of a thorough mixing of dust sources. The sum of Ca-bearing plagioclase content exhibits a general increasing trend superimposed by glacial-interglacial oscillations. In combination with observed plagioclase data in the deserts, the variations of Ca-bearing plagioclase minerals might be used as a proxy for dust source migration and climate changes in the loess source regions. Furthermore, linear relationship between lithogenic magnetic susceptibility (MS) component input and contents of Ca-bearing plagioclase in loess units revises a MS proxy for reconstructing paleo-monsoon precipitation history.

The Tertiary Duchesne River Formation, Utah, U.S.A., represents the last stage of intermontane basin fill in the Uinta Basin. It is surrounded by sediment source mountain ranges of the Uinta Mountains to the north and the Sevier Fold-Thrust Belt (FTB) to the west. Excellent basin-scale exposure of the Duchesne River Formation allows the vertical and lateral characterization of facies architectures in the upstream environments. The four members of the Duchesne River Formation are distinctive lithological units. The lower three members comprise a typical upward-fining unconformity-bounded fluvial sequence from the basal coarse-grained unit into the overlying fine-grained units. The fourth uppermost coarse-grained member records the onset of another upward-fining cycle. The sequence stratigraphy of these unconformity-bounded upward-fining cycle(s) was primarily tectonics-driven due to uplift of the Uinta Mountains. The Duchesne River Formation records a distinct change in fluvial-lacustrine styles between the western and eastern part of the basin, demonstrating the variable allogenic controls of tectonic subsidence and discharge related to the local climate and source-terrain input within the basin. Specifically, the western degradational fluvial system with a high net-sandstone-to-gross-thickness ratio of the basal member was controlled by high discharge due to a wet climate and two source-terrain inputs (i.e., Uinta Mountains and Sevier Fold-Thrust Belt), whereas the eastern aggradational fluvial system with a low net-sandstone-to-gross-thickness ratio was controlled by low discharge due to a dry climate and single source terrain input (i.e., Uinta Mountains). The development of local lacustrine environments on the alluvial plain of the third member, present in the western Uinta Basin, was controlled by differential tectonic subsidence in the basin. The Duchesne River Formation preserves a valuable example of an upstream fluvial sequence, and demonstrates how internal facies architectures at the basin scale were dictated by allogenic controls.",2015,10.2110/jsr.2015.90,Geology,WOS:000367405600002,Paris,No,Yes,No,,UT,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Micah,No,Maybe,No,UT,

Climate change adds to those historical challenges, but does not, for the most part, introduce entirely new challenges; rather climate change is likely to stress water supplies and resources already in many cases stretched to, or beyond, natural limits. Projections are for continued and, likely, increased warming trends across the region, with a near certainty of continuing changes in seasonality of snowmelt and streamflows, and a strong potential for attendant increases in evaporative demands. Projections of future precipitation are less conclusive, although likely the northernmost West will see precipitation increases while the southernmost West sees declines. However, most of the region lies in a broad area where some climate models project precipitation increases while others project declines, so that only increases in precipitation uncertainties can be projected with any confidence. Changes in annual and seasonal hydrographs are likely to challenge water managers, users, and attempts to protect or restore environmental flows, even where annual volumes change little. Other impacts from climate change (e.g., floods and water-quality changes) are poorly understood and will likely be location dependent. In this context, four iconic river basins offer glimpses into specific challenges that climate change may bring to the West. The Colorado River is a system in which overuse and growing demands are projected to be even more challenging than climate-change-induced flow reductions. The Rio Grande offers the best example of how climate-change-induced flow declines might sink a major system into permanent drought.

Aims: To evaluate elevation dependence in long-term precipitation trends in subalpine forest and alpine tundra zones of a mid-continental, mid-latitude North American mountain system and to relate such dependence to atmospheric circulation patterns. Methods: We contrasted 59-year (1952-2010) precipitation records of two high-elevation climate stations on Niwot Ridge, Colorado Front Range, Rocky Mountains, USA. The sites, one in forest (3022m a.s.l.) and the other in alpine tundra (3739m), are closely located (within 7km horizontally, ca. 700m vertically), but differ with respect to proximity to the mountain-system crest (the Continental Divide). Results: The sites exhibited significant differences in annual and seasonal precipitation trends, which depended strongly on their elevation and distance from the Continental Divide. Annual precipitation increased by 60mm (+6%) per decade at the alpine site, with no significant change at the subalpine site. Seasonally, trends at the alpine site were dominated by increases in winter, which we suggest resulted from an increase in orographically generated precipitation over the Divide, driven by upper-air (700 hPa) north-westerly flow. Such a change was not evident at the subalpine site, which is less affected by orographic precipitation on north-westerly flow. Conclusions: Elevation dependence in precipitation trends appears to have arisen from a change in upper-air flow from predominantly south-westerly to north-westerly. Dependence of precipitation trends on topographic position and season has complex implications for the ecology and hydrology of Niwot Ridge and adjacent watersheds, involving interactions among physical processes (e.g. snowpack dynamics) and biotic responses (e.g. in phenologies and ecosystem productivity).",NA,,,,Paris,No,Yes,No,,CO,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Micah,No,Maybe,No,CO,

Aims: Our objective was to predict potential future ecological changes in alpine zones in response to anthropogenic N deposition based on a review of research from Niwot Ridge, Colorado. Results: Empirical observations and experimental studies indicate that plant, algal and soil microbe species compositions are changing in response to N deposition, with nitrophilic species increasing in abundance. Biotic sequestration of N deposition is insufficient to compensate for greater nitrate production, leading to the potential for acidification and base cation loss. Conclusions: Changes in biotic composition in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems have important impacts on ecosystem functioning, including a lower capacity to take up and neutralise the acidifying effect of anthropogenic N, increasing phosphorus limitation of production in terrestrial and aquatic systems, and shifts in rates of N and carbon cycling. Continued elevated N deposition rates coupled with ongoing climate change, including warmer summer temperatures and lower snow cover of shorter duration, will influence the ecological thresholds for biotic and functional changes. We suggest that these thresholds will occur at lower inputs of N deposition under future climate change, meriting reconsideration of current N critical loads to protect sensitive alpine ecosystems.",2015,10.1080/17550874.2014.984786,Plant Sciences,WOS:000371707900001,Paris,No,Yes,No,,CO,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Micah,No,Maybe,No,CO,

A 7900-yr-long pollen and charcoal record was examined to better understand past changes in vegetation and fire activity in relation to large-scale climate variability. From 7900 to 3500 cal yr BP, the dominance of xerophytic species and the frequent fires are consistent with a climate that was warmer and drier than at present. The period from 3500 cal yr BP to present experienced an abundance of mesophytic taxa and reduced fire frequency, suggesting cooler and wetter conditions. The regional history of Abies indicates that it was most widespread during the late-glacial period; its range contracted during the early Holocene thermal maximum, and it steadily expanded during the middle and late Holocene. In contrast, Pseudotsuga was restricted in range during the glacial period, became abundant at low-elevation sites in the Coast and northern Cascade ranges during the early Holocene, and was more prevalent in southern mid-elevation sites as the climate became cooler and wetter in the late Holocene. The sensitivity of these species to past climate change suggests that biogeographic responses to future conditions will be highly variable in this region.

Here we use a high-resolution, well-dated delta C-13 record from Lake Tengchongqinghai (TCQH) in southwestern China, together with other proxy indices, to reconstruct the paleolimnological history over the past 18.5 ka. Organic matter in the sediments of Lake TCQH is derived predominately from aquatic macrophytes. The lacustrine primary productivity is closely linked with lake-level changes affected by variations in the strength of the Asian summer monsoon and modified by evapotranspiration. Similar to lake sediments world-wide, a ca. -3 parts per thousand shift occurred in the delta C-13 values of Lake TCQH in response to the significant increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration during the last deglaciation. In the Holocene, the availability of dissolved CO2 in the lake water of Lake TCQH was determined by variations in hydraulic energy: low water turbulence creates a thick, stagnant boundary layer around aquatic plants, which will restrict the rate of CO2 diffusion and result in more positive delta C-13 values of aquatic plants. In contrast, significant water turbulence dramatically reduces the boundary layer thickness leading to more negative delta C-13 values of aquatic plants. (C) 2015 University of Washington.

Here we ask what changes in the occurrence of extreme hydrologic conditions can be expected by the end of the century for the important water-generating, mountainous basins of the Southwestern United States, namely the Sierra Nevada and Upper Colorado River Basins. The extreme conditions considered are very high flows, low flows, and elevated stream temperature as derived from historic and future simulations using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) hydrologic model and downscaled output from a General Circulation Model ensemble. Results indicate noteworthy differences in the frequency changes of extremes based on geographic region, season, elevation, and stream size. We found wide-spread increases in the occurrence of stream flows exceeding 150% of historic monthly averages for winter by the end of the century, and extensive increases in the occurrence of both extreme low flows (representing <50% of historic monthly averages), and elevated stream temperatures (>3 degrees C of monthly averages) during the summer months, with some basins expecting extreme conditions 90-100% of the time by the end of the century. Understanding the differences in the changes of extreme conditions can identify climate-sensitive regions and assist in targeted planning for climate change adaptation and mitigation.

This paper for the first time presents a detailed description of suspicious rock-boulder deposits, which are remnants of a rock avalanche onto a Late Pleistocene glacier. The boulder deposits cover around 1.1 km(2) and are distributed over an area of around 7.5 km(2) and a variety of landforms: three closely nested distinct terminal moraines (0.45 km(2)) and dislocated terminal moraines (0.34 km(2)) entirely built up of large boulders, lateral moraines that decrease in elevation over a short distance and connect to the terminal moraines, small patches (0.02 km(2)) of boulders that occur in islands on a peat-dominated valley floor, and large patches of boulder fields (0.25 km(2) in size) hanging 350 m above the valley floor. The latter are disconnected from any potential source area. Be-10 cosmogenic nuclide ages of the three terminal moraines give an indistinguishable Late Pleistocene age of 13.6 +/- 1.4 ka, whereas the largest boulder field that is located on the opposite side of the valley from the failed mountain yields a Be-10 age of 14.1 +/- 0.4 ka, which is slightly older but indistinguishable from the moraine deposits within uncertainty margins. All boulder deposits add up to a volume of 31 x 10(6) m(3). The interpretation of a single rock-avalanche source for those landforms is further confirmed by numerical runout modeling using DAN3D. A failure of the entire volume from Skarfjellet Mountain would result in a runout pattern that is identical to that of the distributed boulder fields when considering that the valley was filled with a glacier around 350 m thick. The rock avalanche would not reach the position of the terminal moraines; however, a glacial re-advance could have transported the boulders to that position. The Late Pleistocene rock avalanche was followed by a Holocene rock avalanche with a volume of 23 x 10(6) m(3) and a typical lobate deposit damming the Innerdalen Valley and creating a lake. Be-10 ages indicate that this event occurred 7.97 +/- 0.94 ka ago. Structural measurements performed on high-resolution LiDAR scans show a strongly jointed source rock with three joint sets with dip/dip direction 81/034,86/331, and 77/354 and a foliation with 22/003. The kinematic of the failures can thus be a combination of small-scale wedge failures and planar sliding on shallow dipping foliation.

A zone consisting mainly of Artemisia, Poaceae, and ferns occurs in the basal clay at Porphyry Lake and may represent a non-arboreal ecosystem in a late-Wisconsin glacial refugium. At both sites, a fire-free Pinus contorta zone occurs before ca 14160 calendar years before present (cal BP). Climate at this time is interpreted as being cool. to cold and dry. Mixed conifer forests of Picea, Abies, Tsuga mertensiana and Pinus contorta replaced the Pinus contorta woodlands after ca 14160 cal BP. Fires are recorded for the first time. Climate is interpreted as cool and moist. Forests of Abies, Picea, Tsuga heterophylla, Pseudotsuga menziesii, and Alnus developed and expanded during,the early-Holocene from ca 11400-9910 to 7700-7300 cal BP as climate warmed and dried. Charcoal increased during this interval, indicating only slightly more fire activity and reflecting continued moist conditions at high elevations. In the mid-Holocene from ca 7700-7300 to 5200-4900 cal BP, Tsuga heterophylla pollen values increased as forests became dominated by Tsuga heterophylla, Picea, and Abies with Alnus in response to increased moisture. The increase in charcoal influx at this time may reflect an increase in slope wash and erosion resulting from a wetter climate rather than an increase in fire incidence. Starting at ca 5200-4900 cal BP, a further increase in Tsuga heterophylla combined with an increase in Tsuga mertensiana and Cupressaceae pollen suggest that the late-Holocene was characterised by increasing moisture and decreasing temperatures. Late-Holocene forests consisted predominately of Tsuga heterophylla, Tsuga mertensiana, Cupressaceae, and Pinus contorta. A slight reduction in charcoal influx at ca 4600 cal BP implies fewer fires. A recent increase in charcoal at Walker Lake at 1700 cal BP may reflect anthropogenic burning. The timing of events and response of taxa on southern Vancouver Island are comparable to other coastal sites in northwestern North America, suggesting that past ecosystems were widespread and contemporaneous. Palaeoecosystem changes detected in one region of the Pacific Northwest likely reflect a widepsread response to climate throughout the similar to2500 km long zone, a zone that today is home to half of the world's remaining coastal temperate rainforest.

Compositional characteristics of the volcanic rocks support correlation of the section to the upper Eocene-Oligocene part of the John Day Formation. The similar to 1.2-km-thick section contains five fossil floras documenting climatic change in late Eocene-early Oligocene time and a progression between better known Eocene and Oligocene floras in the region. The presence of the transitional floras is a consequence of the subsidence of the Gray Butte basin to accommodate a section that is nearly four times thicker than better studied correlative strata similar to 50 km to the northeast that consist almost entirely of volcanic rocks. The lowest flora is within flood-plain facies, whereas the other four are hosted in lacustrine strata. Although alteration of volcanic rocks most closely associated with the floras precludes development of a precise isotopic-age chronology, regional correlations and several accurate isotopic-age determinations indicate that the principal interval of climatic cooling may have been in late Eocene time (ca. 38-39 Ma) rather than at the Eocene-Oligocene boundary. The paleoclimate interpretation is tempered, however, by the low diversity of the floras (12-24 species) and possible taphonomic biases in comparing flood-plain and lacustrine environments. Mapping established the presence of the Cyrus Springs fault zone, a large (1.2 km vertical displacement, possibly >7 km dextral offset) shear zone that is possibly a surface expression of the Klamath-Blue Mountain gravity-anomaly lineament. The orientations of this fault zone, subsidiary sinistral structures, dikes, and fold axes suggest that the presumed Mesozoic structure marked by the lineament was reactivated as a dextral-normal fault by east-northeast-west-southwest-oriented compressive stress. This stress is consistent with early Oligocene North America-Farallon convergence but is inconsistent with northwest-southeast to north-south compression suggested by structures farther east. Stress either varied temporally or was partitioned into complex local strain domains. The Cyrus Springs fault zone may have become active at about 28-30 Ma, resulting in uplift and southward tilting of part of the Gray Butte basin fill, and ceased activity before deposition of the horizontal upper Miocene-Pliocene Deschutes Formation. The Gray Butte area was also an eruptive center for rhyolitic and alkaline-mafic lava and tuff both before and after initiation of movement on the Cyrus Springs fault. Mid-Tertiary volcanism and sedimentation near the western end of the Blue Mountains, heretofore not clearly related to active structures, may have taken place within a regional transtensional regime associated with stress orientations different from those of Neogene time. Local basins with higher subsidence rates accumulated relatively thick sequences of lacustrine tuffaceous strata, and their fossil floras show progressive climate change through the Eocene-Oligocene boundary interval.",1998,10.1130/0016-7606(1998)110<0759:LEEOTV>2.3.CO;2,Geology,WOS:000074208200006,Shana,No,,No,,Central OR,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Micah,Yes,No,No,paleo,

The earlier decline coincided with a period of warm temperatures (relative to present) in which at least two severe, multidecadal droughts occurred. This decline was apparently triggered by an increase in the rate of adult mortality in treeline forests. The more recent decline occurred during a period of low temperatures lasting for up to 400 yr and was apparently caused by a sustained failure of regeneration in combination with an increased rate of adult mortality.

Estimates were made at each grid cell for climate variables including daily solar radiation, air temperature, humidity, and precipitation, The topographic structure, water holding capacity, vegetation type and leaf area index were likewise estimated for initial conditions. The daily time series for the climatic drivers was developed from interpolations of meteorological station data for the water year 1990 (1 October 1989-30 September 1990), Model outputs at the l-km resolution showed good agreement with observed patterns in runoff and productivity. The ranges for model inputs at the 10-km and 50-km resolutions tended to contract because of the smoothed topography. Estimates for mean evapotranspiration and runoff were relatively insensitive to changing the spatial resolution of the grid whereas estimates of mean annual net primary production varied by 11%, The designation of a vegetation type and leaf area at the 50-km resolution often subsumed significant heterogeneity in vegetation, and this factor accounted for much of the difference in the mean values for the carbon flux variables.

Accurate estimates of the spatial distribution of precipitation at these scales are critically important inputs into hydrologic models used to simulate these processes over complex terrain. The development of a suitable precipitation model for the Mackenzie basin is seen as an important Step in our understanding of climate variability and climate change under conditions of increasing concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gases. In this study, univariate linear regression is employed to determine the relationships between monthly precipitation and orographic parameters including elevation, aspect and slope in the mountainous terrain of Williston Basin located in north central British Columbia. Slopes, aspects and elevations are calculated using a 5-minute digital elevation model (DEM). The study finds several statistically significant (p < .05) correlations between elevation and monthly precipitation for terrain having either north or east aspect based on individual Julys between 1986 and 1990. Terrain having south or west aspect displays very low correlations for those same months. For winter conditions, the relationship between precipitation and elevation is generally weak for all aspects for individual Januarys between 1986 and 1990, The lack of correlation with wintertime precipitation may very well be due to the poor quality data related to snow undercatch which is estimated to be roughly 50 percent. The quality and quantity of the data generally is also suspect owing to the volume of missing records and the short period of record. Station elevations and DEM elevations correlate equally well with monthly precipitation, contrary to the findings of several recent studies which show better correlations using coarser resolution.

Their study might provide sensitive tests for theories of global climate change. Glacial deposits are often used as time markers in neotectonic and geomorphic studies, and their ages sometimes are inferred from distant measurements or from proxy histories of global climate change. Undated geomorphic features Such as;moraines, sharply incised streams, and river terraces, which commonly have been associated with the last maximum glacier-advance (similar to 20,000 years B.P.) or last deglaciation (similar to 13,000 years B.P.), may actually be older by a factor of 2 to 4 (or more). Conversely, deposits assigned to the maximum advances of the penultimate global glaciation (similar to 130,000 years B.P.) may actually date from early in the most recent glacial cycle and be younger by a comparable factor. Rates of faulting or-folding estimated from displacements or deformation and the assumed ages of such geomorphic features might be too great (or too small) by corresponding factors.",1995,10.1029/95RG00995,Geochemistry & Geophysics,WOS:A1995RJ30100002,Shana,Maybe,No,No,,Ice Age North America,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Micah,No,Maybe,No,global,

The RegCM, which is run with a 60 km gridpoint spacing is interactively coupled with a state-of-the-art surface physics package that includes full surface hydrology calculations (the Biosphere-Atmosphere Transfer Scheme or BATS). The hydrologic budgets of ten regional drainage basins in the US are analysed. Model results are compared with available observations and with results from previous modelling experiments to evaluate the feasibility of using nested RegCM/GCM models for hydrology studies. In our experiment, the model captures the basic seasonality of the basin hydrologic budgets, although the simulated precipitation amounts are too high over the western US and too low over the eastern US. As a result, runoff, snow cover and soil water content are underestimated over the eastern US basins, while evaporation and runoff are overestimated in some of the western US basins. Topographically induced characteristics of precipitation, snow cover and runoff are well simulated over the mountainous western regions. Also well captured is the interbasin variation of hydrologic budgets which occurs in response to different climatic settings. The springtime snowmelt and peak runoff season generally occurs in the model earlier in the year than is observed. Although our work indicates that the coupled regional modelling system can be useful in applications to hydrological studies, results from this experiment indicate that better accuracy in the simulation of regional climatic variables and more detailed representation of some hydrologic processes would be required before the coupled modelling system could be used to provide accurate assessments of hydrologic responses to climate change.",1994,10.1002/qj.49712051510,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,WOS:A1994MR26400009,Shana,Maybe,Yes,No,Biome/National,Entire US,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Micah,No,Maybe,No,USA,

Temporal and spatial patterns of budworm infestations (within-stand occurrences) and outbreaks (more-or-less synchronous infestations across many stands) were investigated to identify local-scale to regional-scale forest disturbance patterns. Nine regional-scale outbreaks were identified from 1690 to 1989. One ancient stand of Douglas-fir trees (Pseudotsuga menziesii) exceeding 700 yr in age revealed that budworms and overstory trees can coexist for extraordinary lengths of time. Using spectral analysis we found that the regional outbreak record contained important cyclical components with periods varying from almost-equal-to 20 to 33 yr. The statistically significant (P < .05) but variable periodicity of regional outbreaks suggests the forest-budworm dynamic is pseudoperiodic (i.e., a stable limit cycle or damped oscillator perturbed by noise). Duration of infestations within stands was almost-equal-to 11 yr and has not obviously changed in the 20th century; however, infestations tended to be more synchronous among stands in this century than during earlier centuries. Regional budworm activity was low from the mid-1920s to late 1930s and mid-1960s to late 1970s, and the most recent outbreak, beginning in the late 1970s, was unusually severe. These results, and contrasting infestation patterns in mountain ranges with different land use histories, generally support a hypothesis that human-induced changes in Southwestern forests have led to more widespread and intense budworm outbreaks in the late 20th century. Despite human-induced changes in the 20th century, climate variation also appears to have been important to budworm regimes in this century as well as in earlier times. Regional outbreaks in the 20th century tended to occur during years of increased spring precipitation, and decreased budworm activity coincided with decreased spring precipitation. No clear association with temperature was identified. Comparisons of regional outbreak history since AD 1600 with a reconstruction of spring precipitation from limber pine (Pinus flexilis) ring width chronologies also shows that periods of increased and decreased budworm activity coincided with wetter and drier periods, respectively. This finding contrasts with results from shorter time-scale studies conducted in northwestern U.S. and Canada (western spruce budworm) and eastern Canada (spruce budworm C. fumiferana), where low precipitation and/or warmer temperatures were generally associated with outbreaks. Different patterns of budworm population response to changing moisture regimes might be due to differences in regional forest-budworm systems, or to differences in the spatial and temporal scales of observation. We conclude that changes in forest structure in the southwestern U.S. may have shifted the spatial and temporal pattern of budworm outbreaks. The dynamic behavior and statistically significant association between multicentury, regional budworm and climate time series also suggest that complex budworm dynamics are driven by a combination of internal and external factors.",1993,10.2307/2937153,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WOS:A1993MN54900004,Shana,No,,No,,NM,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Micah,No,Yes,No,NM,

The relative importance of behavioral responses to climate-induced variation in costs vs. supplies of energy, however, is uncertain, as is the degree to which such responses are mediated by current stores of energy. We evaluated relationships among behavior, nutritional condition (i.e., energy state), and spatiotemporal variation in costs vs. supplies of energy available to a large-bodied endotherm, the North American elk (Cervus elaphus), occupying two ecosystems with contrasting climates and energy landscapes: a temperate, montane forest and an arid, high-elevation desert. We hypothesized that during spring through autumn, behavioral responses to the energy landscape would be both context dependent (i.e., would vary as a function of the contrasting environmental conditions experienced by elk in the forest vs. the desert), and state dependent (i.e., would vary as a function of the energy balance of an individual). We tested several predictions derived from that hypothesis by combining output from a biophysical model of the thermal environment with data on forage quality, animal locations, and nutritional condition of individuals. At the population level, elk in the desert selected areas that reduced costs of thermoregulation over those that provided the highest-quality forage. In the forest, however, costs imposed by the thermal environment were less pronounced, and elk selected areas that increased access to high-quality forage over those that reduced costs of thermoregulation. At the individual level, nutritional condition did not influence strength of selection for low-cost areas or high-quality forage among elk in the forest. In the desert, however, strength of selection for low-cost areas (but not forage quality) was state dependent; individuals in the poorest condition at the end of winter showed the strongest selection for areas that reduced costs of thermoregulation during spring and summer, and also expended the least amount of energy on locomotion. Our results highlight the importance of understanding the roles of behavior and nutritional condition in buffering endotherms against direct and indirect effects of climate on fitness.",2014,10.1890/13-1273.1,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WOS:000340081900008,Adrienne,Yes,Yes,Yes,Ecosystem/Municipal,,NA,,,,,,Becky,Yes,Yes,Yes,"Idaho, WA",Micah,Yes,Yes,Yes,Blue Mts - OR,

One of many assumptions of these approaches is that food web dependencies are consistent in time and environmental space. Species at higher trophic levels that rely on the availability of species at lower trophic levels as food may be sensitive to extinction cascades initiated by changes in the habitat of key food resources. Here we assess climate change vulnerability for Ursus arctos (grizzly bears) in the southern Canadian Rocky Mountains using projected changes to 17 of the most commonly consumed plant food items. We used presence-absence information from 7088 field plots to estimate ecological niches and to project changes in future distributions of each species. Model projections indicated idiosyncratic responses among food items. Many food items persisted or even increased, although several species were found to be vulnerable based on declines or geographic shifts in suitable habitat. These included Hedysarum alpinum (alpine sweet vetch), a critical spring and autumn root-digging resource when little else is available. Potential habitat loss was also identified for three fruiting species of lower importance to bears: Empetrum nigrum (crowberry), Vaccinium scoparium (grouseberry), and Fragaria virginiana (strawberry). A general trend towards uphill migration of bear foods may result in higher vulnerability to bear populations at low elevations, which are also those that are most likely to have human-bear conflict problems. Regardless, a wide diet breadth of grizzly bears, as well as wide environmental niches of most food items, make climate change a much lower threat to grizzly bears than other bear species such as polar bears and panda bears.

Streams and rivers in the U.S. Rocky Mountains have been warming for several decades. At the same time these systems have been experiencing an increase in the severity and frequency of wildfires, which often results in habitat changes including increased water temperatures. We resampled 74 sites across a Rocky Mountain watershed 17 to 20 years after initial samples to determine whether there were trends in bull trout occurrence associated with temperature, wildfire, or other habitat variables. We found that site abandonment probabilities (0.36) were significantly higher than colonization probabilities (0.13), which indicated a reduction in the number of occupied sites. Site abandonment probabilities were greater at low elevations with warm temperatures. Other covariates, such as the presence of wildfire, nonnative brook trout, proximity to areas with many adults, and various stream habitat descriptors, were not associated with changes in probability of occupancy. Higher abandonment probabilities at low elevation for bull trout provide initial evidence validating the predictions made by bioclimatic models that bull trout populations will retreat to higher, cooler thermal refuges as water temperatures increase.

Here we demonstrate the use of a hydrologic landscape (HL) approach to evaluate vulnerability to potential future climate change at statewide and basin scales in the state of Oregon. The HL classification has five components: climate, seasonality, aquifer permeability, terrain, and soil permeability. We evaluate changes when the 1971-2000 HL climate indices are recalculated using 2041-2070 simulation results from the ECHAM (European Centre HAMburg) and PCM (Parallel Climate Model) climate models with the A2, A1b, and B1 emission scenarios. Changes in climate class were modest (4-18%) statewide. However, there were major changes in seasonality class for five of the six realizations (excluding PCM_B1): Oregon shifts from being 13% snow-dominated to 4-6% snow-dominated under these five realizations, representing a 56-68% reduction in snowmelt-dominated area. At the basin scale, simulated changes for the Siletz Basin, in Oregon's Coast Range, include a small switch from very wet to wet climate, with no change in seasonality. However, there is a modest increase in fall and winter water due to increased precipitation. For the Sandy Basin, on the western slope of the Cascades, HL climate class does not change, but there are major changes in seasonality, especially for areas with low aquifer permeability, which experiences a 100% loss of spring seasonality. This would reduce summer baseflow, but effects could potentially be mitigated by streamflow buffering effects provided by groundwater in the high aquifer permeability portions of the upper Sandy. The Middle Fork John Day Basin (MFJD), in northeastern Oregon, is snowmelt-dominated. The basin experiences a net loss of wet and moist climate area, along with an increase in dry climate area. The MFJD also experiences major shifts from spring to winter seasonality, representing a 20-60% reduction in snowmelt-dominated area. Altered seasonality and/or magnitude of seasonal streamflows could potentially affect survival, growth and reproduction of salmonids in these watersheds, with the greatest effects projected for the MFJD. A major strength of the HL approach is that results can be applied to similarly classified, ungaged basins.

Significant differences exist between moth communities at lower and higher elevations. High-elevation moth communities are far more variable inter-annually, whether associated with high-elevation forests, meadows, or clearcuts. Low-elevation young and old gymnosperm forests and riparian forests are more stable and predictable communities having less inter-annual variability. High-elevation communities show more intra-annual variability than low-elevation communities. Low-elevation moth communities are more abundant than high-elevation communities and typically associated with the most common, abundant species of macromoths in the study. High-elevation communities, by contrast, are associated with less abundant, more evenly distributed species, as well as with rare moth species. Macromoth community structure and diversity were related to year or sample period and structural descriptions of vegetation communities, but not related to known host-plant diversity.

Various stakeholders may be interested in different sets of these variables. It is found that temperature and the fraction of winter precipitation that falls as snow exhibit significant trends first, followed in 5-10 years by the fraction of cold-season precipitation retained in the spring snowpack, and later still by the water content of the spring snowpack. Change in total cold-season snowfall is least detectable of all the measures, since it is strongly linked to precipitation, which has large natural variability and only a weak anthropogenic trend in the western United States.

For these models, empirical relationships between elevation and air temperature are frequently used to upscale point measurements or downscale regional and global climate model estimates of air temperature. Mountainous environments are particularly sensitive to air temperature estimates as spatial gradients are substantial, and air temperature plays a critical role in snow-related processes. We use a distributed, coupled ecohydrologic model to compare estimates of streamflow, snowmelt, transpiration, and net primary productivity (NPP) using five temperature interpolation approaches for a forested mountain basin that is dominated by a rain-snow zone in Western Oregon, USA. We compare model estimates using a standard adiabatic lapse rate of -6.5 degrees C km(-1); basin-specific lapse rates created using daily point observations at high, middle, and low elevations; and gridded temperature estimates from the Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) derived at 800 and 50 m resolutions. We show that temperature interpolation strategies influence model calibration. Point-based estimates using a low-elevation station or 800 m PRISM grids result in significantly fewer parameter sets that model streamflow well, suggesting a bias in parameter selection due to errors in input data. The greatest postcalibration impact of temperature lapse rate estimates occurs for model estimates of NPP. The constant temperature lapse rate results in substantially reduced NPP estimates that are more sensitive to the interannual variation in climate forcing. Citation: Garcia, E. S., C. L.

Descriptions of snowpack decline often use linear ordinary least squares (OLS) models to quantify this change. However, the region's precipitation is known to be related to climate cycles. If snowpack decline is more closely related to these cycles, an OLS model cannot account for this effect, and thus both descriptions of trends and estimates of decline could be inaccurate. We used intervention analysis to determine whether snow water equivalent (SWE) in 25 long-term snow courses within the Olympic and Cascade Mountains are more accurately described by OLS (to represent gradual change), stationary (to represent no change), or step-stationary (to represent climate cycling) models. We used Bayesian information-theoretic methods to determine these models' relative likelihood, and we found 90 models that could plausibly describe the statistical structure of the 25 snow courses' time series. Posterior model probabilities of the 29 ""most plausible"" models ranged from 0.33 to 0.91 (mean = 0.58, s = 0.15).

However, estimates of SWE decline differed by as much as 35 % between statistically plausible models of a single time series. This ambiguity is a critical problem for water management policy.

The remaining variation in C stocks was largely attributable to emerging properties of stand dynamics (that is, stand structure and composition). Not only were density- and size-related indicators positively associated with C stocks but also diversity in composition and structure, documenting a close link between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.

There is strong evidence that climate change has contributed to the extent and severity of recent outbreaks. Scientists are interested in quantifying relationships between bark beetle population dynamics and trends in climate. Process models that simulate climate suitability for mountain pine beetle outbreaks have advanced our understanding of beetle population dynamics; however, there are few studies that have assessed their accuracy across multiple outbreaks or at larger spatial scales. This study used the observed number of trees killed by mountain pine beetles per square kilometer in Oregon and Washington, USA, over the past three decades to quantify and assess the influence of climate and weather variables on beetle activity over longer time periods and larger scales than previously studied. Influences of temperature and precipitation in addition to process model output variables were assessed at annual and climatological time scales. The statistical analysis showed that new attacks are more likely to occur at locations with climatological mean August temperatures >15 degrees C. After controlling for beetle pressure, the variables with the largest effect on the odds of an outbreak exceeding a certain size were minimum winter temperature (positive relationship) and drought conditions in current and previous years. Precipitation levels in the year prior to the outbreak had a positive effect, possibly an indication of the influence of this driver on brood size. Two-year cumulative precipitation had a negative effect, a possible indication of the influence of drought on tree stress. Among the process model variables, cold tolerance was the strongest indicator of an outbreak increasing to epidemic size. A weather suitability index developed from the regression analysis indicated a 2.5x increase in the odds of outbreak at locations with highly suitable weather vs. locations with low suitability.

However, variability in such projections for the future periods, particularly the variability arising from uncertain future climates, remains a critical challenge for incorporating these projections into climate change adaptation strategies. We combined the use of a robust statistical modeling technique with a simple consensus approach consolidating projected outcomes for multiple climate change scenarios, and exemplify how the results could guide reforestation planning. Random Forest (RF) was used to model relationships between climate (1961-1990), described by 44 variables, and the geographic distribution of 16 major ecosystem types in British Columbia (BC), Canada. The model predicted current ecosystem distributions with high accuracy (mismatch rate = 4-16% for most ecosystem classes). It was then used to predict the distribution of ecosystem climate niches for the last decade (2001-2009) and project future distributions for 20 climate change scenarios. We found that geographic distributions of the suitable climate habitats for BC ecosystems have already shifted in 23% of BC since the 1970s. Consensus projections for future periods (2020s, 2050s, 2080s) indicated climates suitable for grasslands, dry forests, and moist continental cedar-hemlock forests would substantially expand; climate habitat for coastal rainforests would remain relatively stable; and habitat for boreal, subalpine and alpine ecosystems would decrease substantially. Using these consensus projections and data on the occurrence of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii [Mirb.] Franco) in BC ecosystems, we estimated a twofold increase in seedling demand for this frost-sensitive, commercially important timber species, suggesting managers could begin planning to expand seed inventories and seed orchard capacity to more widely plant this species on logged sites. The results of this work demonstrate the power of RF for building climate envelope models and illustrate the utility of consensus projections for incorporating uncertainty about future climate into management planning. It also emphasizes the immediate need for adapting natural resource management to a changing climate. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Data for this study came from a study established in 1988 that includes 31 research installations located between the Pacific Coast and the Cascade Mountains in Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia. The growth-climate model developed includes: summer heat moisture index (SHM), mean warmest month temperature (MWMT), spring precipitation (PPTsp), and initial height; and captures 78% of the variation in red alder volume increment. Based on this model, estimates of potential future growth were generated for three climate scenarios (i.e., cccma_cgcm3_A2-run4 'warm and wet' of the Canadian Centre for Climate Modeling and Analysis; and ukmo_hadcm3_B1-run1 'cool and moist' and ukmo_HadGEM1_A1B-run1 'hot and dry' of the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research). These projections indicate a potential increase in volume increment of up-to 12% by the 2080s. Range-wide maps were generated for the volume increment potential (VIP) for the reference normal period 1961-1990, for the 'warm and wet' climate scenario, and the 2050s time period, suggesting that climate change may cause a substantial shift in the range and productivity of red alder in the PNW. In addition, maps of the predicted VIP of red alder for the Campbell River District in BC were generated and indicate an overall increase in projected growth of red alder. This study provides evidence that climate change will likely lead to expansion of the range and potential increases in growth for red alder in conjunction with assisted migration of provenance in the PNW. While these results indicate potential increased opportunities for extension of the range of red alder and opportunities for its management, care must be taken to avoid planting alder on sites with high risk of damaging agents such as cold outflow winds, frost, or drought.

A mountain pine beetle epidemic of record size in North America has led to unprecedented mortality of lodgepole pine, and a significant range expansion to the northeast of its historic range. Our goal was to determine the spatial genetic variation found among outbreak population from which genetic structure, and dispersal patterns may be inferred. Beetles from 49 sampling locations throughout the outbreak area in western Canada were analysed at 13 microsatellite loci. We found significant north-south population structure as evidenced by: (i) Bayesian-based analyses, (ii) north-south genetic relationships and diversity gradients; and (iii) a lack of isolation-by-distance in the northernmost cluster. The north-south structure is proposed to have arisen from the processes of postglacial colonization as well as recent climate-driven changes in population dynamics. Our data support the hypothesis of multiple sources of origin for the outbreak and point to the need for population specific information to improve our understanding and management of outbreaks. The recent range expansion across the Rocky Mountains into the jack/lodgepole hybrid and pure jack pine zones of northern Alberta is consistent with a northern British Columbia origin. We detected no loss of genetic variability in these populations, indicating that the evolutionary potential of mountain pine beetle to adapt has not been reduced by founder events.

Rising air temperature will reduce winter snowfall and increase earlier snowmelt, subsequently reducing summer flows. Longer crop-growing season caused by higher temperatures will lead to increases in evapotranspiration and irrigation water demand, which could exacerbate drought damage. However, the impacts of climate change on drought risk will vary over space and time. Thus, spatially explicit drought assessment can help water resource managers and planners to better cope with risk. This study seeks to identify possible drought-vulnerable regions in the Willamette River Basin of the PNW. In order to estimate drought risk in a spatially explicit way, relative Standardized Precipitation Index (rSPI) and relative Standardized Runoff Index (rSRI) were employed. Statistically downscaled climate simulations forcing two greenhouse gas emission scenarios, A1B and B1, were used to investigate the possible changes in drought frequency with 3-, 6-, 12-, and 24-month time scales. The results of rSPI and rSRI showed an increase in the short-term frequency of drought due to decreases in summer precipitation and snowmelt. However, long-term drought showed no change or a slight decreasing pattern due to increases in winter precipitation and runoff. According to the local index of spatial autocorrelation analysis, the Willamette Valley region was more vulnerable (hot spot) to drought risk than the mountainous regions of the Western Cascades and the High Cascades (cold spot). Although the hydrology of the Western Cascades and the High Cascades will be affected by climate change, these regions will remain relatively water-rich. This suggests that improving the water transfer system could be a reasonable climate adaptation option. Additionally, these results showed that the spatial patterns of drought risk change were affected by drought indices, such that appropriate drought index selection will be important in future studies of climate impacts on spatial drought risk.",2012,10.1007/s00704-011-0531-8,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,WOS:000303470500003,Becky,Yes,Yes,Yes,,Willamette River Basin of the PNW,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Micah,Yes,Yes,Yes,OR,

The objective of this study was to determine the relative importance of stand structure, topography, soil characteristics, landscape context (the characteristics of the landscape surrounding the focal stand) and beetle pressure (the abundance of local beetle population eruptions around the focal stand a few years before the outbreak) to explain landscape patterns of tree mortality during outbreaks of three species: the mountain pine beetle, which attacks lodgepole pine and whitebark pine; the spruce beetle, which feeds on Engelmann spruce; and the Douglas-fir beetle, which attacks Douglas-fir. A second objective was to identify common variables that explain tree mortality among beetletree host pairings during outbreaks. Location Greater Yellowstone ecosystem, Wyoming, USA. Methods We used field surveys to quantify stand structure, soil characteristics and topography at the plot level in susceptible stands of each forest type showing different severities of infestation (0-98% mortality; n = 129 plots). We then used forest cover and beetle infestation maps derived from remote sensing to develop landscape context and beetle pressure metrics at different spatial scales. Plot-level and landscape-level variables were used to explain outbreak severity. Results Engelmann spruce and Douglas-fir mortality were best predicted using landscape-level variables alone. Lodgepole pine mortality was best predicted by both landscape-level and plot-level variables. Whitebark pine mortality was best although poorly - predicted by plot-level variables. Models including landscape context and beetle pressure were much better at predicting outbreak severity than models that only included plot-level measures, except for whitebark pine.

This is accomplished using two idealized, physically based models of mountain snowfall to simulate snowpack accumulation for the Cascade Mountains under current and warmed climates. Both models are forced from sounding observations. The first model uses the linear theory (LT) model of orographic precipitation to predict precipitation as a function of the incoming flow characteristics and uses the sounding temperatures to estimate the elevation of the rain-snow boundary, called the melting level (ML). The second ""ML model'' uses only the ML from the sounding and assumptions of uniform and constant precipitation. Both models simulate increases in precipitation intensity and elevated storm MLs under climate warming. The LT model predicts a 14.8%-18.1% loss of Cascade snowfall per degree of warming, depending on the vertical structure of the warming. The loss of snowfall is significantly greater, 19.4%-22.6%, if precipitation increases are neglected. Comparing the two models shows that the predominant control on lS is the relationship between the distribution of storm MLs and the distribution of topographic area with elevation. Although increases in precipitation due to warming may act to moderate lambda(S), the loss of snow accumulation area profoundly limits the ability of precipitation increases to maintain the snowpack under substantial climate warming (beyond 1 degrees-2 degrees C). Circulation changes may act to moderate or exacerbate the loss of mountain snowpack under climate change via impacts on orographic precipitation enhancement.",2010,10.1175/2009JCLI3263.1,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,WOS:000278782600012,Courtney,No,Yes,Yes,Landscape/State-Province,"Climate modeling, Cascades",NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Micah,Yes,Yes,Yes,Cascades,

Specifically, we tested (i) the hypothesis that the Pliocene orogeny of the Cascades and Sierra Nevada caused the divergence of coastal and Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir varieties; and (ii) the hypothesis that multiple glacial refugia existed on the coast and in the Rocky Mountains. We found that Douglas-fir varieties diverged about 2.11 Ma (4.37 Ma-755 ka), which could be consistent with a Pliocene divergence. Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir probably resided in three or more glacial refugia. More variable molecular markers would be required to detect the two coastal refugia suggested in the fossil record. Comparison of mitochondrial DNA and chloroplast DNA variation revealed that gene flow via pollen linked populations isolated from seed exchange. Postglacial colonization of Canada from coastal and Rocky Mountain refugia near the ice margin at the Last Glacial Maximum produced a wide hybrid zone among varieties that formed almost exclusively by pollen exchange and chloroplast DNA introgression, not seed exchange.

Methods We accumulated mtDNA sequence data (c. 560-1700 bp) from 232 pikas representing 64 localities, and sequenced two nuclear introns (mast cell growth factor, c. 550 bp, n = 148; protein kinase C iota, c. 660 bp, n = 139) from a subset of individuals. To determine the distribution of major mtDNA lineages, we conducted a phylogenetic analysis on the mtDNA sequence data, and we calculated divergence times among the lineages using a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo approach. Relationships among nuclear alleles were explored with minimum spanning networks. Finally, we conducted coalescent simulations of alternative models of population history to test for congruence between nDNA and mtDNA responses to Pleistocene glacial cycles. Results We found that: (1) all individuals could be assigned to one of five allopatric mtDNA lineages; (2) lineages are associated with separate mountain provinces; (3) lineages originated from at least two rounds of differentiation; (4) nDNA and mtDNA markers exhibited overall phylogeographic congruence; and (5) introgression among phylogroups has occurred at nuclear loci since their initial isolation. Main conclusions Pika populations associated with different mountain systems have followed separate but not completely independent evolutionary trajectories through multiple glacial cycles. Range expansion associated with climate cooling (i.e. glaciations) promoted genetic admixture among populations within mountain ranges. It also permitted periodic contact and introgression between phylogroups associated with different mountain systems, the record of which is retained at nDNA but not mtDNA loci.

In contrast to previous research suggesting the Snake headwaters are in an area of weak teleconnection influence, the results of this study indicate that the region exhibits a response to El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) that is similar to the Pacific Northwest and strongly modulated by northern Pacific conditions. Although current projections of how dynamic features like ENSO might respond to climate change are highly uncertain, the lagged nature of the relationship between Pacific Ocean conditions and streamflow will be useful for near-term planning. The region was found to be sensitive to shifts in the winter westerly storm track system, with extreme low-flow years associated with a north-shifted storm track.

We demonstrate that wild. re area burned (WFAB) in the American West was controlled by climate during the 20th century (1916-2003). Persistent ecosystem-specific correlations between climate and WFAB are grouped by vegetation type (ecoprovinces). Most mountainous ecoprovinces exhibit strong year-of-fire relationships with low precipitation, low Palmer drought severity index (PDSI), and high temperature. Grass-and shrub-dominated ecoprovinces had positive relationships with antecedent precipitation or PDSI. For 1977-2003, a few climate variables explain 33-87% (mean = 64%) of WFAB, indicating strong linkages between climate and area burned. For 1916-2003, the relationships are weaker, but climate explained 25-57% (mean = 39%) of the variability. The variance in WFAB is proportional to the mean squared for different data sets at different spatial scales. The importance of antecedent climate (summer drought in forested ecosystems and antecedent winter precipitation in shrub and grassland ecosystems) indicates that the mechanism behind the observed. re-climate relationships is climatic preconditioning of large areas of low fuel moisture via drying of existing fuels or fuel production and drying. The impacts of climate change on. re regimes will therefore vary with the relative energy or water limitations of ecosystems. Ecoprovinces proved a useful compromise between ecologically imprecise state-level and localized gridded fire data. The differences in climate . re relationships among the ecoprovinces underscore the need to consider ecological context (vegetation, fuels, and seasonal climate) to identify specific climate drivers of WFAB. Despite the possible influence of. re suppression, exclusion, and fuel treatment, WFAB is still substantially controlled by climate. The implications for planning and management are that future WFAB and adaptation to climate change will likely depend on ecosystem-specific, seasonal variation in climate. In fuel-limited ecosystems, fuel treatments can probably mitigate. re vulnerability and increase resilience more readily than in climate-limited ecosystems, in which large severe. res under extreme weather conditions will continue to account for most area burned.",2009,10.1890/07-1183.1,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WOS:000266281400015,Courtney,Yes,Yes,Yes,Biome/National,"Western US, land cover",NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Micah,Maybe,Yes,Yes,Western US,

Analysis of trends in snow cover duration during the 1966-2007 period of NOAA data showed the largest decreases were concentrated in a zone where seasonal mean air temperatures were in the range of -5 degrees to +5 degrees C that extended around the midlatitudinal coastal margins of the continents. These findings were echoed by the climate models that showed earlier and more widespread decreases in SCD than annual maximum snow water equivalent (SWEmax), with the zone of earliest significant decrease located over the maritime margins of NA and western Europe. The lowest SCD-climate sensitivity was observed in continental interior climates with relatively cold and dry winters, where precipitation plays a greater role in snow cover variability. The sensitivity analysis suggested a potentially complex elevation response of SCD and SWEmax to increasing temperature and precipitation in mountain regions as a result of nonlinear interactions between the duration of the snow season and snow accumulation rates.",2009,10.1175/2008JCLI2665.1,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,WOS:000266002800015,Courtney,No,,No,,western Europe,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Micah,Maybe,Yes,Yes,Western US,

Andrews Experimental Forest (HJA) in the Oregon Cascade Mountains. The influences of both elevation and aspect on soil variables were measured in the early (1998) and late summer (1994). Increased elevation significantly increased soil moisture, mean annual precipitation, soil organic matter, labile C and mineralizable N, microbial activities, extractable ammonium, and denitrification potentials. In contrast, bulk density, pH and soil temperature (1998 only) were significantly lower at the higher elevations. Relative to labile C, mineralizable N was preferentially sequestered at higher elevations. Aspect significantly affected annual mean temperature and precipitation, soil moisture and temperature, soil organic matter, mineralizable N, extractable ammonium, denitrification, and microbial activities. There were no significant higher statistical interactions between elevation and aspect on climatic or soil factors. Soil organic matter (SOM) accumulation at higher elevations is likely driven by a reduction in decomposition rates rather that an increase in primary productivity, however, SOM accumulation on north facing slopes is probably due to both a decrease in decomposition and an increase in primary production. Models of climate change effects on temperate forest soils based on elevational studies may not apply to aspect gradients since plant productivity may not respond to temperature-moisture gradients in the same way across all topographical features.

The analysis is conducted for 26 streamflow gauging stations from three sub-watersheds of the Mackenzie River Basin in northern Canada. The results reveal that for several of the timing measures, many more trends are identified than can be expected to occur by chance. The spring freshet is observed to be occurring earlier with this timing shift appearing particularly strong in headwater catchments.

We evaluate the influences of five potential future temperature scenarios involving different degrees of warming. We use resistant kernel dispersal models to assess population connectivity based on full occupancy of suitable habitat in each of these hypothetical future resistance layers. We use the CDPOP model to simulate gene exchange among individual martens in each of these hypothetical future climates. We evaluate: (1) changes in the extent, connectivity and pattern of marten habitat, (2) changes in allelic richness and expected heterozygosity, and (3) changes in the range of significant positive genetic correlation within the northern Idaho marten population under each future scenario. We found that even moderate warming scenarios resulted in very large reductions in population connectivity. Calculation of genetic correlograms for each scenario indicates that climate driven changes in landscape connectivity results in decreasing range of genetic correlation, indicating more isolated and smaller genetic neighborhoods. These, in turn, resulted in substantial loss of allelic richness and reductions in expected heterozygosity. In the U.

With riparian (floodplain) trees, river cut-banks provide natural hydraulic excavation of root systems and this presents a unique study opportunity. Subsequently, we developed the 'Cut-bank Root Method', a simple, quantitative approach for analyzing the distribution of coarse roots, based on analyses of photographs of river cut-banks. These reveal the vertical extent of roots and median root depths (R-d). We applied this method along six rivers draining the Canadian Rocky Mountains and observed tenfold difference in R-d. The floodplain forests were dominated by cottonwoods and from mountain to prairie zones we observed progressively deeper roots of Populus trichocarpa (black cottonwood, R-d similar to 0.3 m), P. balsamifera (balsam poplar), P. angustifolia (narrowleaf cottonwood), and P. deltoides (prairie cottonwood, R-d similar to 0.9 m), which had Rd similar to P. fremontii (Fremont cottonwood) in Nevada, USA. Roots were shallower for co-occurring facultative riparian trees, with R-d similar to 0.1 m for P. tremuloides (trembling aspen) and Picea glauca (white spruce). Across the Canadian sites, Rd for cottonwoods were strongly associated with a growth season moisture index (May through September precipitation-potential evapotranspiration; R-2 = 0.97, P < 0.001). Thus, in wetter climates, riparian cottonwoods were shallow-rooted and would be more dependent upon rain than stream flow. Conversely, in the drier semi-arid regions the cottonwoods were phreatophytic, with deeper root systems in the capillary fringe above the alluvial ground-water table. These phreatophytic cottonwoods would be highly dependent upon stream flow and vulnerable to declining river flows due to river regulation or climate change.",2011,10.1007/s00468-011-0565-7,Forestry,WOS:000300082800013,Danny,Yes,Yes,Yes,Landscape/State-Province,"Elk, River, Fernie.

Here, 29 Pacific Northwest watersheds illustrate how distribution of seasonal snow, transient snow, and winter rain mediates sensitivity to 20th century warming. Watersheds with >50% of their area in the seasonal snow zone had significant (alpha <= 0.1) trends towards greater winter and lower summer discharge, while lower elevations had no consistent trends. In seasonal snow-dominated watersheds, runoff occurs 22-27 days earlier and minimum flows are 5-9% lower than in 1962, based on Sen's slope over the period. Trends in peak streamflow depend on whether watershed area susceptible to rain-on-snow events is increasing or decreasing. Delineation of elevation-dependent snow zones identifies climate sensitivity of maritime mountainous watersheds and enables planning for water and ecosystem impacts of climate change.

Simultaneously, a Dothistroma needle blight epidemic in northwest BC has been responsible for killing thousands of hectares of pine plantations and has even resulted in the death of mature trees, which is unprecedented. Both of these globally significant forest pest epidemics have been linked to climate change. The beetle epidemic has grossly exceeded the scale of all previously recorded outbreaks, in large part due to a lack of cold winters. In this sense, the link to global warming is relatively straightforward and foreseeable. Of all climate change projections, the prediction of an increase in winter temperatures has been associated with as high a degree of confidence as any. The Dothistroma needle blight epidemic and its link to climate change were not so predictable. Based on weather records over the past four decades, short-term increases in mean summer precipitation correlate closely with historical records of Dothistroma outbreaks in the northwest. The current most severe outbreak has occurred during a prolonged period of above-average summer precipitation. An increase in summer precipitation would more typically be thought of as beneficial for forests, but that increase in moisture has improved the conditions for a pathogen that has outweighed any benefits. Similar trends of increasing incidence and severity for other forest pathogens in BC appear in areas that have been receiving increased summer precipitation. Conversely, in the southern interior of the province decreased summer precipitation and increased drought conditions are resulting in stressed trees which can favour root diseases. Early indications are that climate change will have profound effects on forest health.

I investigated (1) whether this difference in elevational limits has a genetic basis, (2) the importance of clinal genetic differentiation and phenotypic plasticity in phenology as responses to elevation in L. serriola, and whether these responses differ between regions, and (3) whether the realized temperature niche of L. serriola differs between the two regions. Location Plant material was collected in Canton Valais, Switzerland (native range) and the Wallowa Mountains, Oregon, USA (introduced range). The field experiment was conducted in Canton Grisons, Switzerland. Methods Plants from 20 populations collected along elevational gradients were grown in eight common gardens established at 200-m elevational intervals (600-2000 m a.s.l.). The timing of phenological transitions was monitored and analysed with mixed-effects models to determine differences in (1) elevational limits, and (2) clinal genetic differentiation and phenotypic plasticity as responses to elevation for plants from each region. The limits of the species along five temperature gradients were derived from generalized linear models using published occurrence data to quantify regional differences in the realized temperature niche. Results The limit of seed set (1400 m a.s.l.) was the same for plants of both regions. However, the limit of flowering, probably a better reflection of elevational limits in this study, was 400 m higher for plants from the introduced region due to their faster development. Native populations showed clines in development time with elevation consistent with expectations. However, these were weaker in introduced populations, the responses of which were rather characterized by phenotypic plasticity. Thus, although introduced populations grow at considerably cooler sites than in the native region, this is unlikely to have resulted from direct selection for tolerance of high-elevation conditions. Main conclusions This study supports a genetic basis for differences in the elevational limits of L. serriola populations between two parts of its native and introduced range. Although it is not yet clear whether these differences evolved in the introduced range, these findings highlight the potential of alien species for gaining insights into niche evolution.",2010,10.1111/j.1365-2699.2010.02335.x,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Physical Geography,WOS:000282183900012,Danny,No,Maybe,No,Landscape/State-Province,Switzerland,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Micah,Yes,Yes,Yes,OR Wallowa Mts.,

The assumption is frequently made that discharge and drainage area scale linearly or nearly linearly, i. e., Q = kA(c), where k is the theoretical discharge for a unit area watershed (A = 1), Q is river discharge (m(3)/s), A is drainage area (m(2)), and c is the scaling power dependency. Watershed and longitudinal profile modeling enjoy simplified assumptions if discharge grows linearly with drainage area, and this assumption is widely applied. This paper investigates the scaling relationship between discharge and drainage area for five large rivers, with an emphasis on exploring the linearity of the discharge-area relationship and suggesting causes for significant departure from linearity. The five large mainstem rivers explored (John Day, Salmon, Wabash, Greenbrier, and Yellowstone) all have a minimum of 60 years of continuous discharge records and have been selected to represent a wide geographic area spanning different land uses, climate, and topography. Peak annual flow and mean annual flow are compiled from the U. S. Geological Survey national surface-water database, and a linear regression analysis was completed for each year for the discharges. The five rivers were selected to minimize, but not eliminate, the impacts of dams and diversions such as for irrigation on river discharges. The scaling factor ( c) exhibits both secular and nonsecular trends over the length of record for these five rivers. The results show that the studied watersheds can be grouped into two broad categories based on their respective c values: ( 1) those rivers where c is 1 or nearly 1, and ( 2) those rivers where c is significantly < 1. The John Day, Salmon, Wabash, and Greenbrier rivers scale at values of similar to 0.8 with natural variables including slope, elevation, and evapotranspiration potentially accounting for c values slightly < 1. The second category is c values of similar to 0.5, as exhibited by the Yellowstone River. The Yellowstone watershed is unique for our study because of its secular trend, as well as its overall lower average c values. Climatic trends that control the timing of winter snowpack melting, increased frequency and intensity of forest fires, and increased human consumptive water use in downstream areas may all contribute to the observed behavior in c for this watershed.

Fire behavior in riparian zones is complex, but many aquatic and riparian organisms exhibit a suite of adaptations that allow relatively rapid recovery after fire. Unless constrained by other factors, fish tend to rebound relatively quickly, usually within a decade after a wildfire. Additionally, fire and subsequent erosion events contribute wood and coarse sediment that can create and maintain productive aquatic habitats over time. The potential effects of postfire logging in riparian areas depend on the landscape context and disturbance history of a site; however, available evidence suggests two key management implications: (I) fire in riparian areas creates conditions that may not require intervention to sustain the long-term productivity of the aquatic network and (2) protection of burned riparian areas gives priority to what is left rather than what is removed. Research is needed to determine how postfire logging in riparian areas has affected the spread of invasive species and the vulnerability of upland forests to insect and disease outbreaks and how postfire logging will affect the frequency and behavior of future fires. The effectiveness of using postfire logging to restore desired riparian structure and function is therefore unproven, but such projects are gaining interest with the departure of forest conditions from those that existed prior to timber harvest fire suppression, and climate change. In the absence of reliable information about the potential consequence of postfire timber harvest, we conclude that providing postfire riparian zones with the same environmental protections they received before they burned is justified ecologically. Without a commitment to monitor management experiments, the effects of postfire riparian logging will remain unknown and highly contentious.",2006,10.1111/j.1523-1739.2006.00502.x,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WOS:000239545500011,Meghan,No,Yes,Yes,Landscape/State-Province,"western idaho, logging in riparian zones and fire interactions",NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Micah,Yes,Yes,Yes,Western US,

In fire origin stands, both live tree and CWD attributes are influenced initially largely by the characteristics of the stand replacing fire and later increasingly by autogenic processes. Differences in stand structure have also been observed between various stand cover types. Blowdown and insect outbreaks are two significant non-stand replacing disturbances that can alter forest stand structure through removing canopy trees, freeing up available growing space, and creating microsites for new trees to establish. Climate and surficial deposits are highly variable in the boreal forest due to its extensive geographic range, influencing stand and landscape structure by affecting tree colonization, stand composition, successional trajectories, CWD dynamics, and disturbance regimes including regional fire cycles. Further, predicted climate change scenarios are likely to cause regional-specific alterations in stand and landscape structure, with the implications on ecosystem components including wildlife, biodiversity, and carbon balance still unclear. Some stand structural attributes are found to be similar between clearcut and fire origin stands, but others appear to be quite different. Future research shall focus on examining structural variability under both disturbance regimes and management alternatives emulating both stand replacing and nonstand replacing natural disturbances.",2006,10.1080/07352680500348857,Plant Sciences,WOS:000237020400002,Meghan,Maybe,Yes,Yes,Biome/National,Boreal forests of NA. covers the very farthest northern part of the Canadian headwaters,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Micah,Yes,Yes,Yes,BC - northern headwaters,

Mountains are also ideal settings to study contaminant transport and behavior along gradients of climate and surface cover. Information on organic contaminants in mountains is compiled from the literature and synthesized, with a focus on atmospheric transport and deposition, contaminant dynamics in alpine lakes and aquatic organisms, and concentration differences with altitude. Diurnal mountain winds, in connection with enhanced deposition at higher elevations caused by low temperatures and high precipitation rates, conspire to make mid-latitude mountains become convergence zones for selected persistent organic chemicals. In particular, the more volatile constituents of contaminant mixtures seem to become enriched, relative to the less volatile constituents at higher altitudes. For selected contaminants, concentration inversions (i.e., concentrations that increase with elevation) have been observed. A notable difference between cold trapping in high latitudes and high altitudes is the likely importance of precipitation. High rates of snow deposition in mid- and high-latitude mountains may lead to a large contaminant release during snowmelt. Regions above the tree line often have little capacity to retain the released contaminants, suggesting the potential for a highly dynamic contaminant fate situation during the snow-free season with significant revolatilization and runoff. The chemical and environmental factors that control the orographic cold trapping of organic contaminants should be examined further by measuring and comparatively interpreting concentration gradients along several mountain slopes with widely different characteristics. Future efforts should further focus on the bioaccumulation and potential effects of contaminants in the upper trophic levels of alpine food chains, on measuring more water-soluble, persistent organic contaminants, and on studying how climate change may affect contaminant dynamics in mountain settings.",2005,10.1021/es048859u,Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WOS:000226441300010,Meghan,Yes,Yes,Yes,Biome/National,Alpine mountians (including Banff NP),NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Micah,Maybe,Yes,Yes,Western US / Canada,

Field studies and aerial photography were used to address three questions: (1) What is the range and spatial pattern of lodgepole pine sapling density across the burned Yellowstone landscape and what factors best explain this variability? (2) How do ANPP and LAI vary across the landscape and is their variation explained by abiotic factors, sapling density, or both? (3) What is the predicted spatial pattern of ANPP and LAI across the burned Yellowstone landscape? Stand density spanned six orders of magnitude, ranging from zero to 535,000 saplings ha(-1), and it decreased with increasing elevation and with increasing distance from unburned forest (r(2) = 0.37). Postfire densities mapped from 1:30,000 aerial photography revealed that 66% of the burned area had densities less than 5000 saplings ha(-1) and approximately 25% had densities greater than 10,000 saplings ha(-1); stand density varied spatially in a fine-grained mosaic. New allometric equations were developed to predict aboveground biomass, ANPP, and LAI of lodgepole pine saplings and the 25 most common herbaceous and shrub species in the burned forests. These allometrics were then used with field data on sapling size, sapling density, and percent cover of graminoid, forb, and shrub species to compute stand-level ANPP and LAI. Total ANPP averaged 2.8 Mg ha(-1) y(-3) but ranged from 0.04 to 15.12 Mg ha(-1) y(-1). Total LAI averaged 0.80 m(2) m(-2) and ranged from 0.01 to 6.87 m(2) m(-2). Variation in ANPP and LAI was explained by both sapling density and abiotic factors (elevation and soil class) (ANOVA, r(2) = 0.80); abiotic variables explained 51%-54% of this variation. The proportion of total ANPP contributed by herbaceous plants and shrubs declined sharply with increasing sapling density (r(2) = 0.72) and increased with elevation (r(2) = 0.36). However, total herbaceous productivity was always less than 2.7 Mg ha(-1) y(-1), and herbaceous productivity did not compensate for tree production when trees were sparse. When extrapolated to the landscape, 68% of the burned landscape was characterized by ANPP values less than 2.0 Mg ha(-1) y(-1), 22% by values ranging from 2 to 4 Mg ha(-1) y(-1), and the remaining 10% by values greater than 4 Mg ha(-1) y(-1). The spatial patterns of ANPP and LAI were less heterogeneous than patterns of sapling density but still showed fine-grained variation in rates.

In recent decades, runoff from severely burned hillslopes has generated large debris flows in steep tributary drainages. These flows incised alluvial fans along the mainstem river, where charcoal-rich debris-flow and sheetflood deposits preserve a record of latest Pleistocene to Holocene fires and geomorphic response. Through deposit sedimentology and C-14 dating of charcoal, we evaluate the processes and timing of fire-related sedimentation and the role of climate and vegetation change. Fire-related deposits compose similar to 66% of the total measured fan deposit thickness in more densely forested upper basins versus similar to 33% in shrub-steppe-dominated lower basins. Fires during the middle Holocene (similar to 8000-5000 cal. yr BP) mostly resulted in sheetflood deposition, similar to modern events in lower basins. Decreased vegetation density during this generally warmer and drier period likely resulted in lower-severity fires and more frequent but smaller fire-related sedimentation events. In contrast, thick fire-related debris-flow deposits of latest Pleistocene-early Holocene (similar to 13,500-8000 cal. yr BP) and late Holocene (<4000 cal. yr BP) age are inferred to represent higher-severity fires, although data in the former period are limited. Widespread fires occurred in both upper and lower basins within the Medieval Climatic Anomaly (1050-650 cal. yr BP) and the early Little Ice Age' ca. 550 cal. yr BP.

Following deglaciation, the landscape surrounding Dailey Lake was sparsely vegetated, and erosional input into the lake was high. As summer insolation increased and ice recessional processes subsided, Picea parkland developed and diatoms established in the lake at 13,300 cal yr BP. Closed subalpine forests of Picea, Abies, and Pinus established at 12,300 cal yr BP followed by the development of open Pinus and Pseudotsuga forests at 10,200 cal yr BP. Increased planktic diatom abundance indicates a step-like warming at 13,100 cal yr BP, and alternations between planktic and tychoplankic taxa suggest changes in lake thermal structure between 12,400 and 11,400 cal yr BP. An increasingly open forest, in combination with increased benthic diatoms, indicates warm dry summers during the early Holocene after 11,400 cal yr BP, in contrast to nearby records in northern Yellowstone that register prolonged summer-wet conditions until ca. 8000 cal yr BP. Because of its low elevation, Dailey Lake was apparently sensitive to the direct effects of increased summer insolation on temperature and effective moisture, registering dry summers. In contrast, higher elevations in northern Yellowstone responded to the indirect effects of an amplified seasonal insolation cycle on atmospheric circulation, including elevated winter snowpack and/or increased summer convective storms as a result of enhanced monsoonal circulation.

Baseflow in flat basalt landscapes, located in dry warm climates, decrease rapidly during summer months and are most sensitive to future droughts and warming climates. Groundwater systems feeding streams during the driest months can drop to less than 1 mm of effective storage in these sensitive systems. In contrast, the minimum annual storage in mountainous systems can have greater than 10 mm effective storage.

Our study was conducted in the northern Rocky Mountains region of the western United States, where we interacted with 77 U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management personnel through surveys, semistructured interviews, and four collaborative workshops at locations across Idaho and Montana. We used a mixed-methods approach to evaluate managers' perceptions about adapting to and mitigating for climate change. Although resource managers incorporate general language about climate change in regional and landscape-level planning documents, they are currently not planning on-the-ground adaptation or mitigation projects. However, managers felt that their organizations were most likely to adapt to climate change through use of existing management strategies that are already widely implemented for other non climate-related management goals. These existing strategies, (e.g., thinning and prescribed burning) are perceived as more feasible than new climate-specific methods (e.g., assisted migration) because they already have public and agency support, accomplish multiple goals, and require less anticipation of the future timing and probability of climate change impacts.

During an intense rainstorm in November 2006, seven debris flows initiated from proglacial gullies of separate basins on the flanks of Mount Rainier. Gully heads at glacier termini and widespread failure of gully walls imply that overland flow was transformed into debris flow along gullies. We characterized gully change and morphology, and assessed spatial distributions of debris flows to infer the processes and conditions for debris flow initiation. Slopes at gully heads were greater than similar to 0.35 m m(-1) (19 degrees) and exhibited a significant negative relationship with drainage area. A break in slope-drainage area trends among debris flow gullies also occurs at similar to 0.35 m m(-1), representing a possible transition to fluvial sediment transport and erosion. An interpreted hybrid model of debris flow initiation involves bed failure near gully heads followed by sediment recruitment from gully walls along gully lengths. Estimates of sediment volume loss from gully walls demonstrate the importance of sediment inputs along gullies for increasing debris flow volumes. Basin comparisons revealed significantly steeper drainage networks and higher elevations in debris flow-producing than non-debris flow-producing proglacial areas. The high slopes and elevations of debris flow-producing proglacial areas reflect positive slope-elevation trends for the Mount Rainier volcano. Glacier extent therefore controls the slope distribution in proglacial areas, and thus potential for debris flow generation. As a result, debris flow activity may increase as glacier termini retreat onto slopes inclined at angles above debris flow initiation thresholds. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Such projections are based upon the assumptions that (1) species respond primarily to broad-scale climatic regimes, or (2) that variation in climate at fine spatial scales is less relevant at coarse spatial scales. However, in montane forest landscapes, high degrees of microclimate variability could influence occupancy dynamics and distributions of forest species. Using high-resolution bird survey and under-canopy air temperature data, we tested the hypothesis that the high vagility of most forest bird species combined with the heterogeneous thermal regime of mountain landscapes would enable them to adjust initial settlement decisions to track their thermal niches. Location Western Cascade Mountains, Oregon, USA. Methods We used dynamic occupancy models to test the degree to which microclimate affects the distribution patterns of forest birds in a heterogeneous mountain environment. In all models we statistically accounted for vegetation structure, vegetation composition and potential biases due to imperfect detection of birds. We generated spatial predictions of forest bird distributions in relation to microclimate and vegetation structure. Results Fine-scale temperature metrics were strong predictors of bird distributions; effects of temperature on within-season occupancy dynamics were as large or larger (1-1.7 times) than vegetation effects. Most species (86.7%) exhibited apparent within-season occupancy dynamics. However, species were almost as likely to be warm associated (i. e., apparent settlement at warmer sites and/or vacancy at cooler sites; 53.3% of species) as cool associated (i. e., apparent settlement at cooler sites and/or vacancy at warmer sites; 46.7% of species), suggesting that microclimate preferences are species specific. Main conclusions High-resolution temperature data increase the quality of predictions about avian distribution dynamics and should be included in efforts to project future distributions.

One of the main concerns with potential alterations in climate is the propensity for increases in the magnitude and frequency of extremes to occur. Even though precipitation is predicted to increase in some locations, in others precipitation is expected to decrease and evapotranspiration increase with air temperature, resulting in exacerbated drought in the future. Chemical [ozone (O-3) and other air contaminants] and subsequent physical alterations in the environment will have a profound effect on the 'disease triangle' (a favourable environment, a susceptible host and a virulent pathogen) and should be included in any analysis of biological response to climate change. The chemical and physical environment affects plant health and alters plant susceptibility to insect and pathogen attack through increased frequency, duration and severity of drought and reduction in host vigour. The potential effects of climate change and O3 on tree diseases with emphasis on the western United States are discussed.

However, floodplain habitat mosaics are subject to other important landscape-scale disturbance regimes. In the Rocky Mountains of the USA and Canada, fire also affects floodplain habitat patch composition. The floodplain exists at the intersection of disturbance regimes that shape the riverscape and those that shape the landscape. We extended the shifting habitat mosaic concept by examining the effects of multiple disturbance elements on habitat patch composition across the aquatic-terrestrial ecotone of the North Fork of the Flathead River, a free-flowing river in southeastern British Columbia, Canada, and northwestern Montana, USA. We used remotely sensed imagery, meteorological records, empirical and modeled rainfall-runoff data, extent and frequency of past wildfires, and anthropogenic landuse data for 1991-2013 to examine the relationships among hydrology, fire, landuse, geomorphic position, and floodplain habitat patch dynamics. Exploratory path analysis revealed that fire had the strongest total effect and stream power and geomorphic position had moderate total effects on the variability of floodplain habitat patch composition along the North Fork. These 3 factors explained 13 to 26% of the variance in floodplain habitat patch composition between study reaches across all years. We used graphical analysis to examine the locations and intensity of disturbance and recovery pathways across floodplain transition zones throughout the study period. Our results support the hypothesis that hydrologic and fire disturbances and recovery pathways maintain the shifting habitat mosaic across the floodplains of this river system.",2015,10.1086/684016,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,WOS:000364815000015,Paris,Yes,Yes,Yes,plot/family/group,CRB/NW Montana,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Micah,Yes,Yes,Yes,MT CRB,

We outline a simple approach that identifies the mechanisms associated with two guilds of insects - bark beetles and defoliators - which are responsible for substantial tree mortality.

We ask whether functional groupings explain non-native species spread into native vegetation and up elevation gradients. We examine whether non-native species distribution patterns are related to environmental variables after controlling for elevation and, thus, driven by niche processes. LocationThe Wallowa Mountains, northeast Oregon, USA. MethodsWe surveyed non-native plant species along three mountain roads and into the native habitat matrix to assess the extent of invasion success along distance from roadside and elevation gradients. We used GLM to predict single species occurrence probabilities, LMM to examine differences in distribution patterns among functional types, and pCCA to examine multivariate responses of the non-native community to ecological variables. ResultsProbability of occurrence of the eight focal invasive species was not significantly related to distance from the road, but declined with elevation. Non-native species with annual life history strategies were more restricted to lower elevations than perennial species. Non-native species considered invasive occurred at lower minimum elevations than naturalized species. Shifts in the species composition of the non-native plant community were related to changes in soil and climate variables. ConclusionsOur results suggest that invasive species have similar patterns of habitat associations and spread from roadsides to interior vegetation zones, whereas naturalized species partition environmental gradients in this semi-arid montane ecosystem. Furthermore, annual and invasive species groups occupy lower elevations and perennial and naturalized species groups have invaded further up the mountain roads and into the native vegetation. Thus, functional groupings may explain contrasting distribution patterns of non-native species and could be used to inform management strategies for non-native species.",2015,10.1111/avsc.12185,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,WOS:000361181500014,Paris,No,Yes,No,,"Wallowas, OR",NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Micah,Yes,Yes,Yes,Wallowas - OR,

Andrews (Oregon), Coweeta (North Carolina), Hubbard Brook (New Hampshire), and Luquillo (Puerto Rico). Over 600 basinyears of daily streamflow records were examined from 18 basins that have not experienced human disturbances since at least the 1930s and in some cases much longer periods. This study used statistical methods to systematically evaluate the relationship between precipitation and streamflow at a range of spatial and temporal scales, and draw inferences from these relationships about the hydrologic behavior of the basins. Basins in this study had fundamentally different abilities to store and release moisture at a range of time and space scales. These different hydrologic regimes are the result of different types of forest canopies, snow, and soils in the study basins. Through their influences on interception and transpiration, forest canopies appear to play a very important role in the hydrologic regimes at Andrews and Luquillo, but at Coweeta and Hubbard Brook, the current deciduous forest plays a more limited although seasonally important role. Because of the timing of melt and its interaction with soils, seasonal snowpacks at Hubbard Brook and Andrews have quite different effects upon streamflow and vegetation water use. A variety of water flowpath types in soil, from macropore flow to long flowpaths in deep soils or fractured bedrock, appear to operate at the four sites. Hydrologic regimes may help predict the temporal scales of biogeochemical cycling and stream ecological processes, as well as the magnitude and timing of hydrologic response to disturbance and climate change in headwater basins.

Lake sediment charcoal records suggest that fire was more frequent in the early Holocene from 10,000 to 8200 calendar yrs BP, when climate was warmer and drier than today and forest fuels were limited. Fire frequency increased and reached its maximum during the early to mid-Holocene from 8200 to 4000 calendar yrs BP, corresponding to the dry and warm Hypsithermal period in the Rocky Mountains. During the Hypsithermal period forests around Dog Lake were dominated by Pseudotsuga/Larix,Pinus and open meadows of Poaceae that were subject to frequent fire. From 4000 calendar yrs BP to present, fires became less frequent with the onset of cooler and wetter Neoglacial climate and an increase in wet-closed Picea and Abies forests in the valley. Changes in fire frequency are supported by dry-open/wet-closed pollen ratio data indicating that forest type and disturbance regimes vary with changing climate.

The six case study sites represent a range of geographic and hydrologic, as well as institutional and social settings. Large, multi-reservoir systems (Columbia River, Missouri River, Apalachicola-Chatahoochee-Flint (ACF) Rivers), small, one or two reservoir systems (Tacoma and Boston) and medium size systems (Savannah River) are represented. The river basins range from mountainous to low relief and semi-humid to semi-arid, and the system operational purposes range from predominantly municipal to broadly multi-purpose. The studies inferred, using a chain of climate downscaling, hydrologic and water resources systems models, the sensitivity of six water resources systems to changes in precipitation, temperature and solar radiation. The climate change scenarios used in this study are based on results from transient climate change experiments performed with coupled ocean-atmosphere General Circulation Models (GCMs) for the 1995 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment. An earlier doubled-CO2 scenario from one of the GCMs was also used in the evaluation. The GCM scenarios were transferred to the local level using a simple downscaling approach that scales local weather variables by fixed monthly ratios (for precipitation) and fixed monthly shifts (for temperature). For those river basins where snow plays an important role in the current climate hydrology (Tacoma, Columbia, Missouri and, to a lesser extent, Boston) changes in temperature result in important changes in seasonal streamflow hydrographs. In these systems, spring snowmelt peaks are reduced and winter flows increase, on average. Changes in precipitation are generally reflected in the annual total runoff volumes more than in the seasonal shape of the hydrographs. In the Savannah and ACF systems, where snow plays a minor hydrological role, changes in hydrological response are linked more directly to temperature and precipitation changes. Effects on system performance varied from system to system, from GCM to GCM, and for each system operating objective (such as hydropower production, municipal and industrial supply, flood control, recreation, navigation and instream flow protection). Effects were generally smaller for the transient scenarios than for the doubled CO2 scenario. In terms of streamflow, one of the transient scenarios tended to have increases at most sites, while another tended to have decreases at most sites. The third showed no general consistency over the six sites. Generally, the water resource system performance effects were determined by the hydrologic changes and the amount of buffering provided by the system's storage capacity. The effects of demand growth and other plausible future operational considerations were evaluated as well. For most sites, the effects of these non-climatic effects on future system performance would about equal or exceed the effects of climate change over system planning horizons.",1999,10.1023/A:1005448007910,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,WOS:000082666100003,Shana,Yes,Yes,Yes,Landscape/State-Province,Columbia River,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Micah,Yes,Yes,Yes,CR and other rivers,

Study sites were selected on different topographic features at three points along an elevation gradient (ridgetop, valley slope, and valley floor) to characterize site influences on growth response to climate. Mixed species stands were sampled to identify possible differences in species response to climate on a common site. Species differences account for most of the variability in radial growth patterns and response to climate. The greatest differences are between subalpine fir and subalpine larch, while the greatest similarities are between subalpine fir and Engelmann spruce. After species, aspect is the most significant factor affecting growth response to climate. Spring snowpack and summer temperature are the primary climatic factors influencing growth. Spring snowpack is negatively correlated with growth for all three species, but the relationship is strongest for subalpine fir and weakest for subalpine larch. Subalpine larch growth is positively correlated with June temperature. Subalpine fir growth is positively correlated with July-August temperature. Engelmann spruce growth is positively correlated with June-August temperature, but unusually warm July-August temperatures are associated with reduced growth the following year. The response of subalpine forests in the North Cascades to future climate change will depend on winter snowpack accumulations and spring snowmelt rates. Earlier meltouts and warmer summers would benefit growth on north aspect sites, but could also increase the frequency and severity of summer drought conditions on ridges and south-aspect sites, where summer soil moisture may already be limiting.",1994,10.1139/x94-247,Forestry,WOS:A1994QB75000022,Shana,Yes,Yes,Yes,Biome/National,PNW genarally,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Micah,Maybe,Yes,Yes,N.

The total glacier area decreased by 1.20 km(2), corresponding to 9.9% of the glacierized area in 1972. Comparing the two DEMs generated from the topographic maps and Real-Time Kinematic GPS data, the mean glacier thinning rate was 0.64 m yr(-1) between 1972 and 2010.

The ice-volume loss was about 106.8 +/- 46.7 x 10(-3) km(3) (equal to 90.8 +/- 39.7 x 10(-3) km(3) w.e.), which suggested a mean water discharge of 0.1 +/- 0.05 m(3)/s during 1972-2010.

Today, a stable island population of similar to 500 sheep supports limited big game hunting and restocking of depleted areas on the Mexican mainland. We discovered fossil dung morphologically similar to that of bighorn sheep in a dung mat deposit from Mojet Cave, in the mountains of Tiburon Island. To determine the origin of this cave deposit we compared pellet shape to fecal pellets of other large mammals, and extracted DNA to sequence mitochondrial DNA fragments at the 12S ribosomal RNA and control regions. The fossil dung was C-14-dated to 1476-1632 calendar years before present and was confirmed as bighorn sheep by morphological and ancient DNA (aDNA) analysis. 12S sequences closely or exactly matched known bighorn sheep sequences; control region sequences exactly matched a haplotype described in desert bighorn sheep populations in southwest Arizona and southern California and showed subtle differentiation from the extant Tiburon population. Native desert bighorn sheep previously colonized this land-bridge island, most likely during the Pleistocene, when lower sea levels connected Tiburon to the mainland. They were extirpated sometime in the last similar to 1500 years, probably due to inherent dynamics of isolated populations, prolonged drought, and (or) human overkill. The reintroduced population is vulnerable to similar extinction risks. The discovery presented here refutes conventional wisdom that bighorn sheep are not native to Tiburon Island, and establishes its recent introduction as an example of unintentional rewilding, defined here as the introduction of a species without knowledge that it was once native and has since gone locally extinct.",2014,10.1371/journal.pone.0091358,Science & Technology - Other Topics,WOS:000333348500031,Adrienne,No,Maybe,No,,,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Paris,No,Maybe,International,Mexico,

However, accurate interpretations of ELA fluctuations rely on a quantitative understanding of the sensitivity of ELAs to changes in climate. We applied a full surface energy- and mass-balance model to quantify ELA sensitivity to temperature and precipitation changes across the range of climate conditions found in the Andes. Model results show that ELA response has a strong spatial variability across the glaciated regions of South America. This spatial variability correlates with the distribution of the present-day mean climate conditions observed along the Andes. We find that ELAs respond linearly to changes in temperature, with the magnitude of the response being prescribed by the local lapse rates. ELA sensitivities to precipitation changes are nearly linear and are inversely correlated with the emissivity of the atmosphere. Temperature sensitivities are greatest in the inner tropics; precipitation becomes more important in the subtropics and northernmost mid-latitudes. These results can be considered an important step towards developing a framework for understanding past episodes of glacial fluctuations and ultimately for predicting glacier response to future climate changes.

This event prompted the questions of how to define a RoS event and whether those events have become more frequent. Based on the flood of January 2011 and on other known events of the past, threshold values for potentially flood-generating RoS events were determined. Consequently events with rainfall of at least 3 mm on a snowpack of at least 10 mm snow water equivalent (SWE) and for which the sum of rainfall and snowmelt contains a minimum of 20% snowmelt were analysed. RoS events were estimated for the time period 1950-2011 and for the entire study area based on a temperature index snow model driven with a European-scale gridded data set of daily climate (E-OBS data). Frequencies and magnitudes of the modelled events differ depending on the elevation range. When distinguishing alpine, upland, and lowland basins, we found that upland basins are most influenced by RoS events. Overall, the frequency of rainfall increased during winter, while the frequency of snowfall decreased during spring. A decrease in the frequency of RoS events from April to May has been observed in all upland basins since 1990. In contrast, the results suggest an increasing trend in the magnitude and frequency of RoS days in January and February for most of the lowland and upland basins.

The most critical question in this context is whether recruitment trees of a particular species can survive in the shady conditions of the understorey and whether they can contribute to a demographic continuity. Using data from the unique, replicated monitoring site Artist's Wood in North Wales (UK) we investigated the recruitment dynamics of Douglas fir to address the question whether this species can grow in complex forest structures on a long-term basis. Then we compared the results with those from Norway spruce and silver fir plenter forests in the Swiss Jura. Demographic continuity in complex structures is ensured if all forest development stages are represented in appropriate demographic proportions. We quantified these development stages in terms of stem diameter classes and analysed the corresponding diameter growth, competition and the loss of trees due to mortality and forest management. Based on this analysis we determined demographic equilibrium conditions for Artist's Wood. The results confirmed that Douglas fir at Artist's Wood can indeed grow sustainably in complex forest structures at a stand density of 27.4 m(2) ha(-1) basal area which corresponds to a standing volume of 342 m(3) ha(-1). However, equilibrium conditions for Douglas fir can only be achieved at the expense of a lower overall stand density of approximately 85% of that of Norway spruce. Despite this the corresponding Douglas fir stand volume increment of 15.3 m(3) ha(-1) year(-1) is greater than that of Norway spruce. Thus Douglas fir plenter forests are not only possible but are also appealing considering the broad site amplitude of the species in conjunction with ongoing climate change and the potential of the species for CO2 retention.

Unlike most forests in the southwestern United States, the forests of the SSPM have never been logged and have experienced only light grazing in recent years, and wildfires have not been suppressed until recent decades. The SSPM represents one of the best examples of an intact presettlement forest in the California Floristic Province. We investigated the mode of seed dispersal of Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi) in the SSPM, and compared it to that from the eastern slope of the Sierra Nevada, to determine how this process might differ between nearly pristine and heavily altered forests. We found that seed dispersal appears to occur by the same means in both forests (i.e., scatter hoarding of seeds by rodents), but that seedling establishment is much less successful in the SSPM. We considered several hypotheses for why this difference might exist, including the size of seed crops, fire regimes, climate change, grazing by domestic ungulates, and lack of facilitation by shrubs (i.e., nurse plants), but none of these explanations appears adequate to account for the difference. Instead, we suggest that the slow rate of seedling establishment at the SSPM is due to a greater consumption of seeds cached by California chipmunks (Tamias obscurus), who experience a relatively long period of euthermic winter activity in the warm climate of the SSPM. This greater consumption leaves few seeds to germinate. Future studies should test the relative importance of these alternative causes for low seedling recruitment at the SSPM.",2012,,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WOS:000209014700009,Becky,No,Yes,No,,"Baja California, Mexico",NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Paris,No,Maybe,International,Mexico,

Flow is considered a master variable that shapes channel morphology and the heterogeneity, distribution, and turnover of floodplain habitats. Despite their highly dynamic nature, the relative abundance of different habitat elements (islands, gravel bars) in natural floodplains seems to remain relatively constant over ecological periods and is referred to as the shifting mosaic steady state concept. In this conceptual context, we analysed spatiotemporal changes in relative habitat abundance and channel complexity of an alpine floodplain from its near natural state in 1940 before water abstraction and levee construction until 2007 using historical aerial images. Within the first decades of impairment, the relative abundance of floodplain habitats that depend on flood and flow pulses such as parafluvial channels and islands shifted toward a greater abundance of terrestrial forest and grassland habitats. After 1986, the duration and frequencies of high-precipitation events (>60?mm 24?h1) triggering major, channel-reworking floods increased substantially and caused a restructuring of the floodplain and decrease in the abundance of more terrestrial habitat types. These results are contrary to expectations of the shifting mosaic steady state concept yet suggest its potential application as an indicator of landscape transformation and human impacts on floodplain ecosystems. Last, the results raise the applied question as to whether an increased frequency of high flow events induced by climate change can contribute to floodplain restoration.

In the southern United States and northern Mexico, warm events (El Nino) are associated with moist winter conditions and fewer fires, while cool events (La Nina) tend to favor dry winters and more fires. We tested this relationship in a region of northeastern Mexico by characterizing the historical fire regime and climatic influences. Fire regimes were reconstructed from fire-scar samples collected from 100 trees in three high-elevation sites on Pena Nevada in southern Nuevo Leon. The sites were similar to 25 ha each, and the site centers were similar to 1 km apart. The earliest recorded fire occurred in 1521 and the time period we used for analysis was 1645-1929. The sites were characterized by frequent surface fires before the 1920s. In the three sites, mean fire intervals ranged from 8.6 to 9.6 years (all fires) and 11.9 to 18.6 years (fires that scarred >= 25% of recording trees). The per-tree mean fire return interval was 17 years, and all three sites burned in the same year seven times between 1774 and 1929. After 1929, fires were nearly eliminated in all sites, likely due to human causes. We found a temporal change in the association between ENSO events and fires; before the 1830s La Nina events were significantly associated with fire years, while after the 1830s this association was not significant. In 1998, when the most severe El Nino event of the past century occurred, the three sites experienced severe, stand-replacing fires that killed many trees that had survived multiple surface fires in the past. Prior to the 1830s, fires tended to occur during dry La Nina years, but since then both La Nina and El Nino have been associated with dry years in this region, especially during the last three decades. This result suggests that ENSO effects have changed over time in this location and that phases of ENSO are not consistent indicators of precipitation, fire occurrence, or fire behavior in this area of northeastern Mexico.",2010,10.1890/09-0845.1,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WOS:000278859700012,Courtney,No,,No,,Northeastern Mexico,NA,,,,,,Becky,No,,No,southern United States and northern Mexico,Paris,No,Yes,International,Mexico,

But, in many sediment budget studies the quantification of magnitude and time-scale of sediment storage is still the weakest part and often relies on crude estimations only, especially in large drainage basins (>100 km(2)). We present a new approach to storage quantification in a meso-scale alpine catchment of the Swiss Alps (Turtmann Valley, 110 km(2)). The quantification of depositional volumes was performed by combining geophysical surveys and geographic information system (GIS) modelling techniques. Mean thickness values of each landform type calculated from these data was used to estimate the sediment volume in the hanging valleys and the trough slopes. Sediment volume of the remaining subsystems was determined by modelling an assumed parabolic bedrock surface using digital elevation model (DEM) data. A total sediment volume of 781.3x10(6)-1005.7x10(6) m(3) is deposited in the Turtmann Valley. Over 60% of this volume is stored in the 13 hanging valleys. Moraine landforms contain over 60% of the deposits in the hanging valleys followed by sediment stored on slopes (20%) and rock glaciers (15%). For the first time, a detailed quantification of different storage types was achieved in a catchment of this size. Sediment volumes have been used to calculate mean denudation rates for the different processes ranging from 0.1 to 2.6 mm/a based on a time span of 10 ka. As the quantification approach includes a number of assumptions and various sources of error the values given represent the order of magnitude of sediment storage that has to be expected in a catchment of this size.

The data presented in this study highlight three stages of glacial retreat on the southern flank of the Alps at remarkably similar ages that are 14.9 +/- 0.8 Be-10 ka for the end of Oldest Dryas cold period, 10.9 +/- 1.1 Be-10 ka for the end of Younger Dryas cold period and 8.4 +/- 0.9 Be-10 ka for a late ice retreat stage. Previously published data from the Northern Alps lead also to an age of 15.7 +/- 1.0 ka for the Oldest Dryas deglaciation followed by the Younger Dryas at 11.3 +/- 1.0 ka, and a late discrete ice retreat event at 9.7 +/- 1.2 ka. The last glacial retreats occur thus simultaneously across the Alps and the deglaciation process was most likely unrelated to variations in latitude or to mountain flank exposition throughout the Alps. This may be ascribed to a relatively rapid climate change. Subsequent mountain slope evolution following the rapid glacier unloading is reflected by landslides and fault reactivation directly following the deglacial period. This temporal coincidence is ascribed to a cause-to-consequence effect of glacial unloading and water infiltration into tectonic and landslide triggering. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In this article, we studied the effect of a single drought episode, occurred which in summer 2005, on a Scots pine population in central Pyrenees (NE Spain). Our main objective was to study the environmental correlates of forest decline and vegetation change at the plot level. General and generalized linear models were used to study the relationship between canopy defoliation, mortality and recruitment, and plot characteristics. A drought-driven multifactor dieback was observed in the study forest. Defoliation and mortality were associated with the local level of drought stress estimated at each plot. In addition, stand structure, soil properties, and mistletoe infection were also associated with the observed pattern of defoliation, presumably acting as long-term predisposing factors. Recruitment of Scots pine was low in all plots. In contrast, we observed abundant recruitment of other tree species, mostly Quercus ilex and Q. humilis, particularly in plots where Scots pine showed high defoliation and mortality. These results suggest that an altitudinal upwards migration of Quercus species, mediated by the dieback of the currently dominant species, may take place in the studied slopes.

By use of calibration data sets, environmental variables can be inferred quantitatively. The resulting long time-series may assist in distinguishing natural environmental variability from human-induced variability, both in terms of climate change and biotic turnover. However, the validity of the palaeoenvironmental reconstructions depends on their accuracy, precision and sensibility. Before performing palaeoenvironmental inferences, key mechanisms controlling contemporary species' distribution, abundances and dynamics should be identified and understood. An inference model is developed to produce reconstructions. A major challenge lies in validating and interpreting the reconstructions. Calibration data sets involving midges (Diptera: Chironomidae) suggest that climate has a broad-scale, regional control over midge existence and abundance, often over-riding the influence of local within-lake variables. In recent years, the use of midges as quantitative indicators of past temperatures has greatly expanded. As the number of reconstructions increase, especially in Fennoscandia and North America, it seems the among-site variability is so large that it is unlikely to be due only to local differences in climate. Hence, we question whether the long climate gradients in calibration data sets can accurately be used to calibrate local variables, when most local gradients in time and space are short. Ten Holocene chironomid-inferred temperature curves from Fennoscandia are compared. We illustrate some general principles in palaeoecology by identifying factors that may cause bias. Especially, we consider how calibration data sets simplify the complexity of the real world by maximizing single ecological gradients and by not taking into account co-varying variables. We give some recommendations and criteria that chironomid analysis should meet in order to improve the reliability of the temperature inferences.

During winter, the temperature at the base of the snow cover (BTS) is significantly lower at the active rock glacier than on permafrost-free ground adjacent to the rock glacier. Discharge is characterized by strong seasonal and diurnal variations, and is strongly controlled by the local weather conditions. Water temperature of the rock glacier springs remains constantly low, mostly below 1degreesC during the whole melt season. The morphology of the rock glaciers and the presence of meltwater lakes in their rooting zones as well as the high surface flow velocities of >1 m/yr point to a glacial origin. The northern rock glacier, which is bounded by lateral moraines, evolved from the debris-covered tongue of a small glacier of the Little Ice Age with its last highstand around A.D. 1850. Due to the global warming in the following decades, the upper parts of the steep and debris-free ice glacier melted, whereas the debris-covered glacier tongue transformed into an active rock glacier. Due to this evolution and due to the downslope movement, the northern rock glacier, although still active, at present is cut off from its ice and debris supply.

In this project, we investigated bark beetle populations and insect damage in Pinus trees along an altitudinal gradient in order to obtain an overview of damage at regional level, and also to analyze the consequences of rising temperatures on insect damage in trees. The study was conducted in the communal pine forests of Nuevo San Juan Parangaricutiro in the state of Michoacan, Mexico. In September 2011, 32 Lindgren traps were hung along an altitudinal gradient from 2200 to 2750 m a.s.l., with traps set at 150-200 m intervals of altitudinal difference. In each trap, alpha-Pinene and turpentine were added as bark beetle attractants. Every three weeks over a study period of one year, the captured insects were collected and identified in the laboratory. Abiotic site conditions (temperature and humidity) were also measured at each altitude hourly. During the dry season, phytosanitary characterization was conducted at each site. Throughout the study, 19 Scolytinae bark beetle species were recorded, all of which were considered to be non-aggressive pests. Bark beetles showed higher species richness and abundance at the lowest altitude (2200 m a.s.l.), particularly on the early collection dates, compared to other altitudes (2400, 2600 and 2750 m a.s.l.; p < 0.05). Maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and lowest humidity were higher at low altitudes while maximum humidity was higher at high altitudes. There was a significant positive relationship between maximum temperature and bark beetle abundance. Pines with bark beetles damage were more abundant at 2200 m a.s.l. with Pinus pseudostrobus identified as the most damaged tree species. Higher temperatures at lower elevations and projected temperature rise appear to be related to higher damage by the bark beetles on susceptible tree species in these communal forests. Possible management strategies are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

RUAPEHU; CATASTROPHIC DRAINAGE; MOUNTAIN ENVIRONMENTS; NUMERICAL-SIMULATION,"Glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) are highly mobile mixtures of water and sediment that occur suddenly and are capable of traveling tens to hundreds of kilometers with peak discharges and volumes several orders of magnitude larger than those of normal floods. They travel along existing river channels, in some instances into populated downstream regions, and thus pose a risk to people and infrastructure. Many recent events involve process chains, such as mass movements impacting glacial lakes and triggering dam breaches with subsequent outburst floods. A concern is that effects of climate change and associated increased instability of high mountain slopes may exacerbate such process chains and associated extreme flows. Modeling tools can be used to assess the hazard of potential future GLOFs, and process modeling can provide insights into complex processes that are difficult to observe in nature. A number of numerical models have been developed and applied to simulate different types of extreme flows, but such modeling faces challenges stemming from a lack of process understanding and difficulties in measuring extreme flows for calibration purposes. Here we review the state of knowledge of key aspects of modeling GLOFs, with a focus on process cascades. Analysis and simulation of the onset, propagation, and potential impact of GLOFs are based on illustrative case studies. Numerical models are presently available for simulating impact waves in lakes, dam failures, and flow propagation but have been used only to a limited extent for integrated simulations of process cascades. We present a spectrum of case studies from Patagonia, the European Alps, central Asia, and the Himalayas in which we simulate single processes and process chains of past and potential future events. We conclude that process understanding and process chain modeling need to be strengthened and that research efforts should focus on a more integrative treatment of processes in numerical models.

Here we provide the first cosmogenic (Be-10) age constraints on prominent rock avalanches and rockfalls (collectively termed 'rock slope failures' - RSFs) from the Tatra Mountains, the highest mountain range with the most pronounced glacier morphology within the Carpathians. Six representative RSF5 were selected for surface exposure dating in the mountain range. Two sites are situated in the western part with less pronounced local relief and gentler slope gradient, and four come from the highest eastern part with oversteepened rock slopes. Our dataset also contains the largest known RSF in the Tatra Mountains; the Koprova rock avalanche with a volume of similar to 5.4 x 10(6) m(3). Based on 26 1 Be dated boulders, the weighted mean ages of individual RSF accumulations range between 20.2 +/- 1.2 and 10.1 +/- 0.3 ka. Our results suggest that smaller, structurally predisposed failures (mainly rockfalls) in the steepest parts of the mountains reacted immediately (i.e. a few hundred years) to deglaciation, whereas more complex slope deformations in terrain with lower local relief, involving the largest rock avalanche in the Tatra Mountains, experienced a substantial time lag (i.e. several millennia) in respect to ice retreat. In the case of delayed RSF5, their origin can be well correlated with warmer and more humid periods in the Lateglacial/early Holocene such as the Bolling-Allerod chronozone and after the onset of the Holocene.

The lake has been receiving acidic precipitation and heavy metals loading from the atmosphere since the 1940's. A total of 22 chironomid taxa were recorded. The most important taxa were typical elements of oligotrophic lakes, i.e. Micropsectra insignilobus, Paratanytarsus penicillatus, Stictochironomus spp. and Heterotrissocladius marcidus. Based on the cluster analyses results for the reconstructed environmental variables and chironomid communities, three developmental stages were distinguished from the lake history: (1) Natural ontogeny stage (before 1945); (2) Initial stage of anthropogenic ontogeny (1945-1982); and (3) Anthropogenic ontogeny stage (1982-1996). During the first period, the changes in the chironomid fauna were characterized as an anthropogenically undisturbed community, with M. insignilobus dominating (46-66%). The changes during the second period reflected the initial phase of anthropogenic succession associated with the beginning of acidification and heavy metal pollution. The main species showed opposite distributional patterns in this period; the abundance of the group M. insignilobus/Stictochironomus spp. decreased, whereas the abundance of P. penicillatus/H. marcidus increased. The third period was characterized by a major shift in the faunal assemblages, from M. insignilobus to other dominant species including P. penicillatus (19-30%). The increases of Orthocladiinae relative abundance and total organic content in the uppermost sediment layers may be explained by a decrease in lake productivity. The decreases of cold-stenothermal taxa Stictochironomus spp. and M. insignilobus in the uppermost sediment layers can be explained by the global warming during the 20th century.

Pollen and diatom evidence from Lake Tritrivakely (19 degrees 47'S) provides information on vegetational and hydrological changes in the central highlands of Madagascar over the past 40,000 yr. Most of the record reflects natural environmental variability since humans arrived on the island ca. 2000 yr B.P. During glacial times, the migration of mountain plants toward lower altitudes is consistent with a temperature decrease and with reduced atmospheric CO2 levels. In the lake, a positive mean annual hydrologic balance, from 38,000 to 36,000 and from 17,500 to 9800 cal yr B.P., coincided with periods of decreasing summer insolation and preceded by several millennia lake rises in the northern tropics. A negative hydrologic budget during periods of maximum seasonal contrast in solar radiation is partly attributed to high summer evaporation rate. The last glacial maximum was cool and dry. The deglacial warming occurred in two steps. The first step, accompanied by an increase in wetness, occurred abruptly at ca. 17,000 cal yr B.P., about two millennia earlier than in the northern hemisphere. It is abundantly documented in southern terrestrial data. The second step, at 15,000 cal yr B.P., was in phase with the first major temperature change in the northern hemisphere.

Reduced fire frequency is recognised as a main causative agent for Pinus-Juniperus L. (pinon-juniper) expansion in North American woodlands. Pinon-juniper control measures, including prescribed fire, are increasingly employed to restore sagebrush steppe communities. We compared vegetation recovery following prescribed fire on Phase 2 (mid-succession) and Phase 3 (late-succession) Juniperus occidentalis Hook. (western juniper) woodlands in Oregon. The herbaceous layer on Phase 2 sites was comprised of native perennial and annual vegetation before and after fire. On Phase 3 sites the herbaceous layer shifted from native species to dominance by invasive Bromus tectorum L. (cheatgrass). After fire, shrubs on Phase 2 sites were comprised of sprouting species and Ceanothus velutinus Dougl. (snowbrush). On Phase 3 woodland sites the shrub layer was dominated by C. velutinus.

This article examines summer runoff from two basins in the La Sal Mountains, Utah: the non rock glaciated Wet Fork and rock glaciated Gold Basin. Runoff events were analyzed for volume of stormflow, stormflow duration, and peak flow duration. Four events were recorded in Wet Fork (n=4), five events were recorded in Gold Basin (n = 5), and six events at a flume immediately adjacent to the Gold Basin rock glacier (n = 6). Wet Fork hydrographs are dominated by baseflow throughout the summer and a small proportion (0.13%-0.31%) of precipitation leaves the basin as stormflow during storms. Gold Basin hydrographs are characterized by early season snowmelt with flood peaks associated with summer storms. Runoff from the gaged rock glacier represents 15%-30% of total basin runoff and is inversely related to precipitation and directly related to rainfall intensity. Removal of rock glacier hydrographs from total basin hydrographs indicates that there is increased surface runoff from alpine drainage basins that contain rock glaciers, suggesting rock glaciers act as impervious surfaces. This short-term study in Utah suggests that alpine drainage basins with rock glaciers could have greater surface runoff and higher flood peaks than drainage basins that lack rock glaciers. While the long-term effects of rock glaciers on summer water resources is still unknown, this investigation demonstrates rock glaciers may profoundly influence hydrographs in alpine drainage basins.",2014,10.1657/1938-4246-46.3.645,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Physical Geography,WOS:000341282400011,Adrienne,No,Yes,No,,,NA,,,,,,Courtney,No,Yes,No,Rock glaciers in northern Utah,Paris,No,Maybe,No,UT,

These ecosystems are especially vulnerable to channel incision as meadow aquifers are hydrologically connected to tributaries, and many have not yet recovered from previous anthropogenic influences. While instream restoration projects have become a common approach, lack of postrestoration monitoring and communication often result in a trial-and-error approach. In this study we demonstrate that preimplementation modeling of possible instream restoration solutions, chosen to raise stream stage and subsequently groundwater levels, is a useful tool for evaluating and comparing potential channel modifications. Modeling allows us to identify strategic locations and specific methods. Results show additional sediment depth and roughness on tributaries along with introduced woody debris (simulated by high roughness) on the Tuolumne River are the most effective means of raising stream stage.

The current climate period is shown to agree well with Snowpack Telemetry (SNOTEL) surface observations of precipitation (P) and snowpack, as well as streamflow and AmeriFlux evapotranspiration (ET) observations.

Runoff decreased by an average of 6%, reflecting the increased aridity. Precipitation increased in the future winter by 12%, but decreased in the summer as a result of increased low-level inhibition to convection.

Interbasin flow is propounded based on: (1) water budget imbalances, (2) potential differences between basins, (3) stable isotope evidence, and (4) modeling studies. However, water budgets are too imprecise to discern interbasin transfers and potential differences may exist with or without interbasin fluxes. Potentiometric maps are dependent on conceptual underpinnings, leading to possible false inferences regarding interbasin transfers. Isotopic evidence is prone to non-unique interpretation and may be confounded by the effects of climate change. Structural and stratigraphic considerations in a geologically complex region like the Great Basin should produce compartmentalization, where increasing aquifer size increases the odds of segmentation along a given flow path. Initial conceptual hypotheses should explain flow with local recharge and short flow paths. Where bedrock interbasin flow is suspected, it is most likely controlled by diversion of water into the damage zones of normal faults, where fault cores act as barriers. Large-scale bedrock interbasin flow where fluxes must transect multiple basins, ranges, and faults at high angles should be the conceptual model of last resort.",2014,10.1007/s10040-014-1104-6,Geology; Water Resources,WOS:000336269500006,Adrienne,Maybe,No,No,,Seems to be only an abstract,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Paris,No,Yes,No,Great Basin,

However, the impacts of forest disturbance on flow regimes have rarely been investigated in large watersheds. In this study, we used a large severely disturbed watershed, the Baker Creek watershed located in the central interior of British Columbia, Canada, to examine how forest disturbance altered the flow regimes and to discuss the possible ecological implications of these alterations. Equivalent clear-cut area, an indicator combining all types of forest disturbances and accounting for hydrological recovery, was adopted to represent the cumulative forest disturbance levels over time at a watershed scale. Flow duration curves and time series cross-correlation analysis were used to detect the statistical significance of relationships between flow regimes (magnitude, duration, timing, frequency and variability of high flows and low flows) and forest disturbance (clear-cut area). The results showed that the magnitude of high flows was significantly increased and the timing of high flows was significantly advanced by forest disturbance. After forest disturbance, the occurrence of high flows with greater return periods became more frequent with increased variations. In addition, forest disturbance significantly increased the magnitude of low flows but with reduced variability. On average, high flows and low flows in the disturbed period were 31<bold>4</bold>% and 16<bold>0</bold>% greater than those in the reference period, respectively.

Brook trout consumption was highest in the main stem where diets shifted from insects in headwaters to fishes and crayfish in larger streams. Despite high water temperatures, trout growth rates also were consistently highest in the main stem, likely due to competitively dominant trout monopolizing thermal refugia. Temporal changes in trout density had a direct negative effect on brook trout growth rates.

In 2008, we conducted field surveys and reconstructed forest conditions at multiple stages within a recent mountain pine beetle (MPB) outbreak in Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado. At each stage in the outbreak, we examined changes in (1) lodgepole pine mortality and surviving stand structure, (2) the influence of topographic versus stand structure variables on mortality rates, and (3) stand complexity and landscape heterogeneity. Lodgepole pine mortality reduced basal area by 71 %, but only 47 % of stems were killed. Relative to pre-outbreak stands, surviving stands had lower mean dbh (11.0 vs. 17.4 cm), lower basal area (8.5 vs. 29.3 m(2) ha(-1)), lower density (915 vs. 1,393 stems ha(-1)), and higher proportions of non-host species (23.1 vs. 10.6 % m(2) ha(-1)). Factors predicting mortality rates changed through the course of the outbreak. Tree mortality during the early stage of the outbreak was associated with warm, dry sites and abundant large trees. During the middle and late stages, mortality was associated with stand structure alone. Stand complexity increased, as defined by stand-scale variability in density, basal area, and the proportion of susceptible trees. Landscape heterogeneity decreased according to semi-variograms of tree diameter and basal area.

New material of Apodosauriscus minutus further bolsters the case for its relationship to living Anniella. Glyptosaurine anguids are also present, including new species referred to Xestops, Arpadosaurus, and Glyptosaurus, the last with distinctive crushing posterior teeth. A distinctive new anguimorph lineage, Entomophontes, may be related to Xenosaurus. Considerable cranial material is referred to a new species of Provaranosaurus; we argue that this lineage is closely related to extant Shinisaurus. Restes-like remains are smaller and rare. Helodermatidae is represented by a single osteoderm. The varanid Saniwa is present. The four localities examined here record an interval of warming in the Rocky Mountain interior, when temperatures rose toward their Cenozoic acme in the Eocene Climatic Optimum.

The vulnerability of buildings affected by torrent processes can be quantified by vulnerability functions that express a mathematical relationship between the degree of loss of individual elements at risk and the intensity of the impacting process. Based on data from the Austrian Alps, we extended a vulnerability curve for residential buildings affected by fluvial sediment transport processes to other torrent processes and other building types. With respect to this goal to merge different data based on different processes and building types, several statistical tests were conducted. The calculation of vulnerability functions was based on a nonlinear regression approach applying cumulative distribution functions. The results suggest that there is no need to distinguish between different sediment-laden torrent processes when assessing vulnerability of residential buildings towards torrent processes. The final vulnerability functions were further validated with data from the Italian Alps and different vulnerability functions presented in the literature. This comparison showed the wider applicability of the derived vulnerability functions. The uncertainty inherent to regression functions was quantified by the calculation of confidence bands. The derived vulnerability functions may be applied within the framework of risk management for mountain hazards within the European Alps. The method is transferable to other mountain regions if the input data needed are available. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The 30-year water quality record for the upper Snake River in Colorado, USA, shows that summer low-flow zinc concentrations have increased four- to sixfold concurrently with increases in mean annual and summer temperatures and a two- to three-week advancement in spring snowmelt. We found that the main source of zinc and other metal loads to the upper Snake River was a tributary draining an alpine area rich in disseminated pyrite. By conducting a tracer experiment in this tributary of interest, we demonstrated that 30% of the trace metal loading entered in an upper steep, rocky reach where the tributary of interest is fed by an alpine spring. Another increase in flow and metal loading occurred where the tributary of interest flows through a gently sloped wetland area. Analysis of the tracer experiment indicated a significant increase in hyporheic exchange along this wetland reach, from which metals appear to be mobilized. Several potential explanations are presented that might explain this phenomenon: decreasing pH in the tributary of interest may result in mobilization of metals from the wetland and hyporheic zone; the geochemistry of groundwater inflows to the wetland may be changing; and, wetland soils may be drying out with longer, warmer summers. This study illustrates how changes in hydrologic regime may cause changes in biogeochemical processes that exacerbate the danger to aquatic ecosystems associated with ARD.

These landscapes have also been affected by glacial advances and retreats, causing alpine taxa to undergo range shifts and demographic changes. These nonequilibrium population dynamics have the potential to obscure the effects of environmental factors on the distribution of genetic variation. Here, we investigate how demographic change and environmental factors influence genetic variation in the alpine butterfly Colias behrii. Data from 14 microsatellite loci provide evidence of bottlenecks in all population samples. We test several alternative models of demography using approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), with the results favouring a model in which a recent bottleneck precedes rapid population growth. Applying independent calibrations to microsatellite loci and a nuclear gene, we estimate that this bottleneck affected both northern and southern populations 531281 years ago, coinciding with a period of global cooling. Using regression approaches, we attempt to separate the effects of population structure, geographical distance and landscape on patterns of population genetic differentiation. Only 40% of the variation in FST is explained by these models, with geographical distance and least-cost distance among meadow patches selected as the best predictors. Various measures of genetic diversity within populations are also decoupled from estimates of local abundance and habitat patch characteristics.

Climate change scenarios for the 2050s indicate that snow water equivalent could diminish by 50% to 80% in low-elevation basins of the south coastal region of British Columbia. This could trigger a shift from a hybrid to a pluvial regime for many creeks originating in the coastal mountains and could negatively affect summer low flows. However, the connection between recharge occurring in the headwaters during snowmelt and late-summer water yield remains unclear. A mountainous creek (Stephen's Creek) was monitored in a nested design from September 2008 to November 2009. A two-component isotopic hydrograph separation method was developed by adapting the runoff-corrected model to a semidistributed environment to account for both the spatial and the temporal variability of the isotopic release from the snowpack in the headwater catchment. Results show that snowmelt composed most of the streamflow both at the headwater site (66%?+/-?19%) and at the mouth (62%?+/-?23%) during the peak of the freshet, and its contribution to streamflow was significantly different in July (34%?+/-?11% at the headwater vs 7%?+/-?4% at the mouth). Streamflow recession analysis suggests that a snowmelt-recharged headwater catchment can support a steadier summer base flow compared to a much larger but rainfed-dominated watershed. This study concluded that the large input of meltwater during the spring was sufficient to overturn shallow subsurface reservoirs and to recharge deeper flow paths at a rate that cannot be matched by rainfed-dominated systems.

Repeated surveys throughout the spawning season allowed us to fit an individually based parametric model and estimate the day of year on which spawning was initiated, reached its midpoint, and ended during each year. Spawning phenology was then assessed relative to (1) mean of maximum daily air temperature and (2) mean of maximum daily water temperature at the lake bottom during summer in each year using a linear model. Elevated temperatures in summer were correlated with a delay in spawning and a reduction in the total number of redds constructed. Increasing the summer mean of maximum daily air temperatures by 1 degrees C delayed spawning by approximately 1week and decreased the total number of redds constructed by nearly 65. Lake spawning brook trout select redd sites based on the presence of discharging groundwater that is relatively constant in temperature within and across years, leading to relatively consistent egg incubation times.

For headwater salmonids, spatially close kin association among age-0 individuals suggests that sampling strategy (number of individuals and location from which they are collected) will influence estimates of N (e) through family representation effects. We collected age-0 brook trout by completely sampling three headwater habitat patches, and used microsatellite data and empirically parameterized simulations to test the effects of different combinations of sample size (S = 25, 50, 75, 100, 150, or 200) and number of equally-spaced sample starting locations (SL = 1, 2, 3, 4, or random) on estimates of mean family size and effective number of breeders (N-b).

This strategy limited bias by ensuring samples contained individuals from a high proportion of available families while providing a large enough sample size for precise estimates. Because this sampling effort performed well for populations that vary in family structure, it should provide a generally applicable approach for genetic monitoring of iteroparous headwater stream fishes that have overlapping generations.",2012,10.1007/s10592-011-0313-y,Biodiversity & Conservation; Genetics & Heredity,WOS:000303476900002,Becky,No,No,No,,,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Paris,No,Yes,No,VA,

In this study, we reviewed and synthesized the published literature on modifications to fuels and fire characteristics following beetle-caused tree mortality. We found 39 studies addressing this topic with a variety of methods including fuels measurements, fire behavior simulations, an experiment, and observations of fire occurrence, severity, or frequency. From these publications, we developed a conceptual framework describing expected changes of fuels and fire behavior. Some characteristics of fuels and fire are enhanced following outbreaks and others are unchanged or diminished, with time since outbreak a key factor influencing changes. We also quantified areas of higher and lower confidence in our framework based on the number of studies addressing a particular area as well as agreement among studies. The published literature agrees about responses in many conditions, including fuels measurements and changes in stands with longer times since outbreak, and so we assigned higher confidence to our conceptual framework for these conditions. Disagreement or gaps in knowledge exist in several conditions, particularly in early postoutbreak phases and crown fire behavior responses, leading to low confidence in our framework in these areas and highlighting the need for future research. Our findings resolved some of the controversy about effects of bark beetles on fire through more specificity about time since outbreak and fuels or fire characteristic. Recognition of the type of study question was also important in resolving controversy: some publications assessed whether beetle-caused tree mortality caused differences relative to unattacked locations, whereas other publications assessed differences relative to other drivers of wildfire such as climate. However, some disagreement among studies remained. Given the large areas of recent bark beetle and wildfire disturbances and expected effects of climate change, land and fire managers need more confidence in key areas when making decisions about treatments to reduce future fire hazard and when fighting fires.

The quality of water from infested forests may also be diminished as a result of increased nutrient export.

Urban growth in the past half-decade has led to home construction directly underneath hundreds of debris-flow channels, but debris flows are not recognized as a potential hazard at present. One of the first steps in a hazard assessment is to determine occurrence rates. The north flank of the Ma Ha Tuak Range, just 10 km from downtown Phoenix, was selected to determine the feasibility of using the varnish microlaminations (VML) method to date every debris-flow levee from 127 catchment areas. Only 152 of the 780 debris-flow levees yielded VML ages in a first round of sampling; this high failure rate is due to erosion of VML by microcolonial fungi. The temporal pattern of preserved debris-flow levees indicates anomalously high production of debris flows at about 8.1 ka and about 2.8 ka, corresponding to Northern Hemisphere climatic anomalies. Because many prior debris flows are obliterated by newer events, the minimum overall occurrence rates of 1.3 debris flows per century for the last 60 ka, 2.2 flows/century for the latest Pleistocene, and 5 flows/century for the last 8.1 ka has little meaning in assessment of a contemporary hazard. This is because newer debris flows have obliterated an unknown number of past deposits. More meaningful to a hazards analysis is the estimate that 56 flows have occurred in the last 100 years on the north side of the range, an estimate that is consistent with direct observations of three small debris flows resulting events from a January 18-22, 2010 storm producing 70 mm of precipitation in the Ma Ha Tuak Range, and a 500 m long debris flow in a northern metropolitan Phoenix location that received over 150 mm of precipitation in this same storm. These findings support the need for a more extensive hazard assessment of debris flows in metropolitan Phoenix. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The primary objective of this study was to measure the catch-and-release mortality of rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss, brown trout Salmo trutta, and mountain whitefish Prosopium williamsoni in three water temperature treatments, namely, when daily maximum water temperatures were cool (<20 degrees C), warm (20-22.9 degrees C), and hot (>= 23 degrees C). A secondary objective was to assess the catch-and-release mortality of salmonids angled in morning and evening within the water temperature treatments. These objectives were related to Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks' drought fishing closure policy. Angling (fly-fishing only) occurred in the Gallatin and Smith rivers. All angled fish were confined to in-stream holding cages and monitored for mortality for 72 h. Mortality of rainbow trout peaked at 16% in the Gallatin River and 9% in the Smith River during the hot treatment. Mortality of brown trout was less than 5% in all water temperature treatments in both rivers. Mountain whitefish mortality peaked at 28% in the hot treatment in the Smith River. No mortality for any species occurred in either river when daily maximum water temperatures were less than 20 degrees C. Mortality of rainbow trout peaked at 16% in the evening hot treatment in the Smith River. Mortality rates of brown trout and mountain whitefish were not related to time of day. The catch-and-release mortality rates presented here probably represent fishing mortality given that most anglers in southwestern Montana practice catch-and-release angling. The mortality values we observed were lower than predicted (<30%) given reports in the literature.

Charcoal influx was low between 11,200 and 8000 cal yr BP when vegetation consisted of sparse Pinus-dominated forest and montane chaparral shrubs. High charcoal influx after similar to 8000 cal yr BP marks the arrival of Tsuga mertensiana and Abies magnifica, and a higher-than-present treeline that persisted into the mid-Holocene. Coeval decreases in fire episode frequency coincide with neoglacial advances and lower treeline in the Sierra Nevada after 3800 cal yr BP. Independent fire response occurs between 9200 and 5000 cal yr BP, and significant synchrony at 100- to 1000-yr timescales emerges between 5000 cal yr BP and the present, especially during the last 2500 yr. Indistinguishable fire-return interval distributions and synchronous fires show that climatic control of fire became increasingly important during the late Holocene. Fires after 1200 cal yr BP are often synchronous and corroborate with inferred droughts. Holocene fire activity in the high Sierra Nevada is driven by changes in climate linked to insolation and appears to be sensitive to the dynamics of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation.

Managing these systems in a way that ignores climate-change will likely fail to meet management objectives. The uncertainty in projected climate change impacts is one of the greatest challenges facing managers attempting to address global change. In order to select successful management strategies, managers need to understand the uncertainty inherent in projected climate impacts and how these uncertainties affect the outcomes of management activities. Perhaps the most important tool for managing ecological systems in the face of climate change is active adaptive management, in which systems are closely monitored and management strategies are altered to address expected and ongoing changes. Here, we discuss the uncertainty inherent in different types of data on potential climate impacts and explore climate projections and potential management responses at three sites in North America. The Central Valley of California, the headwaters of the Klamath River in Oregon, and the barrier islands and sounds of North Carolina each face a different set of challenges with respect to climate change.

Pedogenic calcite occurs in semi-arid and and regions in the form of calcareous, calcic, and petrocalcic horizons. Understanding the processes governing the storage and flux of this inorganic C pool is crucial to the development of accurate regional and global C budgets. Objectives of this study were to: (I) develop a process-based pedogenic calcite model that accounts for landscape hydrology and geomorphic position, (2) calibrate model parameters with field data from a Mojave Desert landscape, and (3) apply the model to understanding soil inorganic C response to elevated atmospheric CO(2) concentrations. Two parameters are introduced in this study to account for surface water redistribution on the landscape: the precipitation threshold (Omega) and the topographic index threshold (Lambda). These parameters account for runoff-generating rainfall events (Omega) and the potential to shed or collect water at a location (Lambda). A one-dimensional compartmentalized thermodynamic model is used to simulate calcite precipitation and dissolution. Geomorphic delineation, sediment collected from dust traps, and detailed soil descriptions including percent sand and clay, and bulk density from 16 soil pits of the southern Fry Mountain piedmont served as inputs into the model. Precipitation and temperature inputs were simulated using stochastic models. Time steps for the sample sites used to calibrate the model were determined from optically-stimulated luminescence dates. Incorporation of precipitation and topographic index thresholds into the model allowed more information to be extracted from carbonate depth distributions than previous pedogenic calcite models. The model predicts a net loss of inorganic C from the upper 10 cm soil depth under elevated atmospheric CO(2) and a consequent gain in the 10-20 cm depth. The leaching of calcite from shallow depths to below 10 cm is evident in all landforms including those most susceptible to wind erosion. This leads to the conclusion that increased atmospheric CO(2) levels may result in a concentration of inorganic C at a depth that is protected from wind erosion creating a more geomorphically stable pool of C.

Paradoxically, the majority of available proxy data suggest that during the Miocene, pCO(2) was similar, or even lower, than the pre-industrial levels (280 ppmv; Pagani et al., 1999; Pearson and Palmer, 2000; Kurschner et al., 1996, 2008) and at times probably crossed the modelled threshold value required for sustained glaciation in the Northern Hemisphere (DeConto et al., 2008). Records of ice rafted debris and the oxygen isotope composition of benthic foraminifera suggest that at several times over the last 25 million years substantial amounts of continental ice did build up in the Northern Hemisphere but none of these led to prolonged glaciation. In this contribution, we review evidence that suggests that in the Miocene the North American Cordillera was, at least in parts, considerably lower than today. We present new GCM simulations that imply that small amounts of uplift of the North American Cordillera result in significant cooling of the northern North American Continent. Offline ice sheet modelling, driven by these GCM outputs, suggests that with a reduced topography, inception of the Cordilleran ice sheet is prohibited. This suggests that uplift of the North American Cordillera in the Late Miocene may have played an important role in priming the climate for the intensification of Northern Hemisphere glaciation in the Late Pliocene.",2010,10.5194/cp-6-707-2010,Geology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,WOS:000283667900010,Courtney,No,,No,,North American Cordillera,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Paris,No,Yes,No,BC coast range,

The present study addresses this lacuna. Sixteen squamate species are described in the earliest Eocene (Wao) Castle Gardens local fauna of the tower-most Willwood Formation of the Bighorn Basin, Wyoming. These include: two new iguanids, a species similar to Geiseltaliellus on the stem of Corytophaninae (basilisks and relatives) and a polychrotine (anoles and relatives); new stem representatives of the xantusiid (night lizard) clades Lepidophyma and Xantusia; a 'higher' amphisbaenian (worm lizard) of indeterminate affinities; six anguids, including a new species on the stem of Anniella (California legless lizards), a ?stern diploglossine (galliwasps), a ?stern gerrhonotine (alligator lizards) and a new glyptosaurine morphologically intermediate between 'melanosaurins' and Glyptosaurini; a new anguimorph of undetermined affinities; and two species compared to the varanid (monitor lizard) taxon Saniwa. At least seven species at Castle Gardens were recent immigrants. The nearest relatives of one of these is obscure, but the other six (three iguanids, stem Lepidophyma, stem Anniella, ?stem Diploglossinae) have living relatives exclusively or almost exclusively confined to warm and frost-free (megathermal) parts of the New World. Among lizards, dispersal coincident with climatic warming near the Paleocene/Eocene boundary was predominantly intracontinental. It is argued that when habitat tracking occurs and phylogenetic niche conservatism obtains, species within a clade could migrate in broad concert in response to climate change.

To further explore the possible climatic relationship of Uinta Mountain glaciers and the lake, and to add to the glacial chronology of the Rocky Mountains, we assembled a range-wide chronology of latest Pleistocene terminal moraines based on seventy-four cosmogenic Be-10 surface-exposure ages from seven glacial valleys. New cosmogenic-exposure ages from moraines in three northern and eastern valleys of the Uinta Mountains indicate that glaciers in these parts of the range began retreating at 22-20 ka, whereas previously reported cosmogemic-exposure ages from four southern and western valleys indicate that ice retreat began there between 18 and 16.5 ka. This spatial asynchrony in the start of the last deglaciation was accompanied by a 400-m east-to-west decline in glacier equilibrium-line altitudes across the Uinta Mountains. When considered together, these two lines of evidence support the hypothesis that Lake Bonneville influenced the mass balance of glaciers in southern and western valleys of the range, but had a lesser impact on glaciers located farther east. Regional-scale variability in the timing of latest Pleistocene deglaciation in the Rocky Mountains may also reflect changing precipitation patterns, thereby highlighting the importance of precipitation controls on the mass balance of Pleistocene mountain glaciers.

Open Pinus parklands grew at the site during the early Lateglacial when the climate was cool and dry, but more humid conditions in the later phases of the Lateglacial permitted mesophytic conifers to colonise the region. Early Holocene conditions were warmer than present and a successional mosaic of Tsuga heterophylla and Alnus occurred at Tiny Lake. Climate cooling and moistening at 8740 +/- 70 C-14 a BP initiated the development of closed, late successional T. heterophylla-Cupressaceae forests, which achieved modern character after 6860 +/- 50 C-14 a BP, when a temperate and very wet climate became established. The onset of early Holocene climate cooling and moistening at Tiny Lake may have preceded change at more Southern locations, including within the Seymour-Belize Inlet Complex, on a meso- to synoptic scale. This would suggest that an early Holocene intensification of the Aleutian Low pressure system was an important influence on forest dynamics in the Seymour-Belize Inlet Complex and that the study region was located near the southern extent of immediate influence of this semi-permanent air mass.

We structured the analysis in a Bayesian network (BN) meta-model that incorporated the results of spatially explicit modelling of landscape conditions (natural and logging disturbance. habitat quality, number of potential territories, and connectedness of territories) with analytical population modelling. The BN meta-model was then used to examine habitat and population size responses (adult females only are presented) to management scenarios, in the context of uncertainty of model parameters, management objectives, and climate change. Status quo management is dominantly clear-cutting with 3-20% of each harvest unit retained as mature patches, with reforestation by planting in the remainder. Management options we examined were: (1) the status quo, (2) varying the total annual timber harvest on the landscape (100%, 80% or 50% of current long-term sustained yield estimates), (3) the protection of understory trees during logging, and (4) 30-70% retention of overstory (partial cutting in distinct patches <1 ha in size) in each harvest unit, for 33% or 50% of the annual timber harvest. We found that marten habitat and population size declined substantively with the beetle outbreak and associated salvage cutting. The choice of management strategy then had a long-term effect on the potential for marten recovery after the beetle outbreak. Partial cutting scenarios had the greatest average long-term marten population levels, followed in order by reduced harvest rates, understory protection, and the status quo. Management scenarios with the best chance of meeting conservation goals without over-protecting habitat (and thus unnecessarily constraining timber management) varied with the population objective chosen.

Loss and fragmentation of grasslands and meadows may impact biodiversity, carbon storage, energy balance, and climate change. In the Pacific Northwest region of North America, grasslands and meadows have declined in extent over the past century. Largely undocumented in this regional decline are the grass balds of the Oregon Coast Range, isolated grasslands in a landscape dominated by coniferous forests. This study was conducted to quantify the spatial extent and patterns of grass bald change. Five balds in the Oregon Coast Range were evaluated using historical aerial photographs and recent digital orthophoto quadrangles (DOQ). Over the time period of study (1948/1953 to 1994/2000), bald area declined by 66%, primarily from forest encroachment. The number and average size of bald vegetation patches declined, while edge density increased. Tree encroachment into balds was inversely related to distance from nearest potential parent trees. Spatial patterns of bald loss may result from a forest to bald gradient of unfavorable environmental conditions for tree establishment and/or seed dispersal limitation. Species dependent on balds may be at risk from loss of bald area and increased fragmentation, although metrics of habitat fragmentation may not reflect species-specific habitat requirements. Tree encroachment patterns and increased bald edge densities suggest increasing rates of bald loss in the future. The remote sensing nature of this study cannot determine the fundamental causes of bald decline, although prior research suggests climate change, cessation of native burning, successional changes in response to prior wildfires, and cessation of livestock grazing all may have potential influence.",2009,10.1007/s11258-008-9511-1,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,WOS:000263888200013,Courtney,No,,No,,oregon coast range,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Paris,No,Maybe,No,Coastal OR,

Furthermore, glaciers can constitute hazards, including: glacier outburst floods; changes in the magnitude and timing of runoff in the mountains and adjacent regions; and, through worldwide loss of glacier ice, a global rise in sea level. To understand and ultimately to predict the dynamics and nature of climate and associated glacial and hydrological changes requires an integrated approach with communication and collaboration among glaciologists, glacial geologists, atmospheric scientists, geomorphologists, geochronologists, and tectonists. Current strategies of research are evolving towards integrating research on mountain glaciers to address key scientific, socio-economic and political issues. Given the rapid birth and growth of new technologies and tools with which to study glaciers and glacial landscapes, this community stands poised to address many of these challenges in the near future. The key challenges that must be met soon include: 1) determining the spatial-temporal pattern of fluctuations of mountain glaciers from the last glacial cycle through the present; 2) relating historical and past fluctuations in glaciers to variability in the primary features of ocean-atmospheric circulation; 3) identifying important but poorly understood processes controlling the motion and erosion of glaciers; 4) developing and expanding the application of numerical models of glaciers; 5) modeling the evolution of mountain landscapes in the face of repeated glaciation; 6) examining the climate and the balance of energy and mass at the surface of glaciers; 7) characterizing the role of intrinsic climate variability on glacier variations: and 8) predicting the distribution, sizes, and nature of glaciers in the future. While these ambitious goals are achievable and the research tools exist, success will require significant bridging between the existing research communities involved and ambitious integration of research on mountain glaciers.

Sample transects situated in meadows, known formerly to be in open grassland, were assessed in 2001 (n = 21) and 2002 (n = 33) in areas ranging from 0% to 92% shrub cover. Shrub cover, density, and height were correlated to understory parameters, including herbaceous production, bunchgrass cover and density, and species richness and diversity. Additional data on soil horizon depths were obtained. Analysis was conducted using regression to assess empirical relationships between understory or soil characteristics and the overstory. Stronger empirical relationships (i.e., greater R(2)) were found in 2002, coincident with larger sample sizes and greater rainfall. Among independent overstory variables, aggregate shrub cover for all species accounted for the greatest variation in understory characteristics. Significant (P < 0.01) negative nonlinear relationships were observed between shrub cover and herbage production, with the latter declining from 6 629 kg . ha(-1) in meadows containing less than 12% shrub cover, to 2 797 kg . ha(-1) in areas where shrub cover exceeded 35%. Negative linear trends were found (P < 0.01) for bunchgrass density and cover in relation to increasing shrub abundance in 2002. Understory diversity increased with shrub abundance, peaking at 64% shrub cover in 2002. Meadows with low and high shrub cover also coincided with thicker Ah and litter, fibric, and humic soil layer (LFH) horizons, respectively. Collectively, these results indicate shrub encroachment is threatening the sustainability of native bunchgrass communities and reducing forage availability.

These include a reduction in the amount of precipitation arriving as snow, a decline in snowpack at low and midelevations, and a shift toward earlier arrival of both snowmelt and the centroid (center of mass) of streamflows. To project future water supply reliability, it is crucial to obtain a better understanding of the underlying cause or causes for these changes. A regional warming is often posited as the cause of these changes without formal testing of different competitive explanations for the warming. In this study, a rigorous detection and attribution analysis is performed to determine the causes of the late winter/early spring changes in hydrologically relevant temperature variables over mountain ranges of the western United States. Natural internal climate variability, as estimated from two long control climate model simulations, is insufficient to explain the rapid increase in daily minimum and maximum temperatures, the sharp decline in frost days, and the rise in degree-days above 0 degrees C (a simple proxy for temperature-driven snowmelt). These observed changes are also inconsistent with the model-predicted responses to variability in solar irradiance and volcanic activity. The observations are consistent with climate simulations that include the combined effects of anthropogenic greenhouse gases and aerosols. It is found that, for each temperature variable considered, an anthropogenic signal is identifiable in observational fields.

Five reaches with distinct sedimentation patterns were delineated along the Dinwoody Creek drainage. This paper focuses on a portion of the jokulhlaup route where erosion of the forested banks created 16 large logjams spaced at longitudinal intervals of tens to hundreds of meters. Aggradation within the main channel upstream from each logjam created local sediment wedges, and the jams facilitated overbank deposition during the jokulhlaup. Field surveys during 2004 and 2006 documented logjam characteristics and associated erosional and depositional features, as well as initial modification of the logjams and flood deposits within the normal seasonal high-flow channel. Overbank deposits have not been altered by flows occurring since 2003. Field measurements Supported three hypotheses that (i) logjams present along the forested portions of the jokulhlaup route are larger and more closely spaced than those along adjacent, otherwise comparable stream channels that have not recently experienced a jokulhlaup; (ii) logjams are not randomly located along the jokulhlaup route, but instead reflect specific conditions of channel and valley geometry and flood hydraulics; and (iii) the presence of logjams facilitated significant erosional and depositional effects. This paper documents a sequence of events in which Outburst floodwaters enhance bank erosion and recruitment of wood into the channel, and thus the formation of large logjams. These logjams sufficiently deflect flow to create Substantial overbank deposition in areas of the valley bottom not commonly accessed by normal snowmelt peak discharges, and through this process promote valley-bottom aggradation and sediment storage. Changes in the occurrence of glacier outburst floods thus have the potential to alter the rate and magnitude of valley-bottorn dynamics in these environments, which is particularly relevant given predictions of worldwide global warming and glacial retreat. Processes observed at this field site likely occur in other forested catchments with headwater glaciers. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Fuel treatments have been suggested as a means to limit the size and intensity of wildfires but few experiments are available to analyze the ecological effects of different treatments. The objective of this study is to determine how mechanical, prescribed fire, and mechanical and fire combination fuel treatments affected seedling density by species in a Sierra Nevada mixed conifer forest. The relative influences of stand-level light availability and substrate quality on conifer and black oak seedling densities are assessed. For all species combined, seedling densities increased when the fire only treatment was applied and no change was detected for the other treatments. The fire only treatment as well as the combined fire plus mechanical treatment had the effect of significantly increasing Douglas-fir seedling density. Ponderosa pine seedling densities significantly increased when the fire plus mechanical treatment was applied. California black oak seedling density decreased when the fire only treatment was applied but no change was detected for the other treatments. Previous studies have found a decline in sugar pine and ponderosa pine in dense stands of Sierran mixed conifer forests. The findings reported here corroborate these studies in that current conditions are not conducive to recruitment of ponderosa pine and sugar pine species. Our initial results indicate, that in this case, treatments used to reduce fire hazard may not result in retention or recruitment of California black oak and sugar pine seedlings.

Analysis of climate reconstructions beginning from 500 CE and population data show that temperature and drought predict changes in biomass burning up to the late 1800s CE.

However, the threat of invasion is likely to increase because of climate change, greater anthropogenic land use, and continuing novel introductions. Preventive management, therefore, will be crucial but can be difficult to promote when more pressing problems are unresolved and predictions are uncertain. In this essay, we use management case studies from 7 mountain regions to identify common lessons for effective preventive action. The degree of plant invasion in mountains was variable in the 7 regions as was the response to invasion, which ranged from lack of awareness by land managers of the potential impact in Chile and Kashmir to well-organized programs of prevention and containment in the United States (Hawaii and the Pacific Northwest), including prevention at low altitude. In Australia, awareness of the threat grew only after disruptive invasions. In South Africa, the economic benefits of removing alien plants are well recognized and funded in the form of employment programs. In the European Alps, there is little need for active management because no invasive species pose an immediate threat. From these case studies, we identify lessons for management of plant invasions in mountain ecosystems: (i) prevention is especially important in mountains because of their rugged terrain, where invasions can quickly become unmanageable; (ii) networks at local to global levels can assist with awareness raising and better prioritization of management actions; (iii) the economic importance of management should be identified and articulated; (iv) public acceptance of management programs will make them more effective; and (v) climate change needs to be considered.

One hypothesis for explaining this ecosystem resilience centers on the disruption of forest dynamics by frequent disturbance and climatic variability, and the resulting development of non-steady-state regimes dominated by early-successional conifers with broad climatic tolerances, such as lodgepole pine (Plaits contorta var. latifolia Engelm. ex Wats.). To evaluate this hypothesis, we independently reconstructed the vegetation, fire, and effective-moisture histories of a small, forested watershed at 2890 in elevation in southeastern Wyoming, USA, using sedimentary pollen and charcoal counts in conjunction with sedimentary lake-level indicators. The data indicate that prominent vegetation shifts (from sagebrush steppe to spruce fir parkland at ca. 10.7 ka and spruce fir parkland to pine-dominated forest at ca. 8.5 ka ika stands for thousands of years before the present, defined as AD 1950]) coincided with changes in effective moisture. However, after lodgepole pine forests established at ca. 8.5 ka, similar hydroclimatic changes did not produce detectable vegetation responses. Fire history data show that other aspects of the ecosystem were responsive to changes in effective moisture at centennial timescales with prolonged fire-free episodes coinciding with periods of low effective moisture ca. 7.2-5.6 and 3.7-1.6 ka. Throughout our record, the ratio of ecosystem perturbation time (i.e., fire frequency and changes in effective moisture) to recovery time (assuming 200-600-year successional processes) falls within estimates of the ratio for non-steady state ecosystems. Frequent perturbations, therefore, may have prevented this ecosystem from reaching compositional equilibrium with the varied climatic conditions over the past 8.5 ka. Equilibrium states could have included more abundant spruce (Picea spp.) and fir (Abies spp.) than presently observed ""based on.brief increases in pollen abundances of these taxa during prolonged dry, fire-free intervals.

Douglas-fir, introduced in Europe in the 19th century, is of high economic interest because of its enormous growth performance. Whether its growth potential remains higher than that of native tree species over the course of climatic changes must be examined by analyses of climate sensitivity. Dendroecology allows retrospective analyses of radial tree growth at an annual resolution. Single year and correlation analysis with respect to climate data expressed as deviations from the 1961-1990 mean were carried out over the 1910-2002 period. Altogether 389 adult Douglas-fir, Scots Pine, spruce, beech and oak trees from 28 stands are analysed. The sites are located in two regions in the northwestern area of the German low mountain ranges, National Park Eifel and National Park Kellerwald/Edersee. The climate diagrams show for the Eifel a higher precipitation amount than for the Kellerwald (Fig. 1a, b; Tab. 1). Tree species respond differently to climatic anomalies and have different species specific pointer years. Only in 1976 all tree species show negative reactions caused by heat and drought (Fig. 2a). 1976 is characterised by a warm and dry summer in combination with a dry beginning of the growing season in both regions and above average previous year summer temperatures. In 1917 only Douglas-fir shows significant growth reductions in both of the regions. The climatic situation can be described by a cold and dry February and a cold spring-time (Fig. 2b). All species show significant correlations to temperature and precipitation. Native tree species show a homogeneous response pattern: correlations to temperature are negative in summer and previous year summer and positive in winter. Positive relations to precipitation are dominating especially in early summer and previous year autumn Douglas-fir shows deviating reactions, especially to temperature: response to previous year summer temperatures is lower and no significant negative reactions are detectable to summer temperatures of the current year. However there are high positive correlations to February temperature (Fig. 3a, b). The results show Douglas-fir's vast insensitivity to rising summer temperatures and growth reductions due to below-average summer precipitation. The latter are on average comparable with native tree species. High February temperatures enhance the growth of Douglas-fir, which can be ascribed to photosynthesis in winter possibly combined with additional water supply after snowmelt. This study shows that compared with native tree species, the Douglas-fir has high potential to cope with projected climatic changes, especially on sites where beech and spruce trees suffer already from increasing drought conditions. For instance, Douglas-fir could replace spruce in mixed beech stands.",2012,,Forestry,WOS:000303851600003,Danny,No,Yes,No,Ecosystem/Municipal,Some German Low Mtn Range,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Paris,No,Yes,International,Germany,

The research determined that climate change will decrease system safe yield in the future and that alternative operating policies or other system changes are necessary to meet projected demands beyond the year 2055.

The Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) of IPCC projected by seven general circulation models (GCM), namely, Japan's CCSRNIES, Canada's CGCM2, Australia's CSIROMk2b, Germany's ECHAM4, the USA's GFDLR30, the UK's HadCM3, and the USA's NCARPCM, driven under four SRES climate scenarios (A1FI, A2, B1, and B2) over three 30-year time periods (2010-2039, 2040-2069, 2070-2100) were used in these studies. The change fields over these three 30-year time periods are assessed with respect to the 1961-1990, 30-year climate normal and based on the 1961-1990 European Community Mid-Weather Forecast (ECMWF) re-analysis data (ERA-40), which were adjusted with respect to the higher resolution GEM forecast archive of Environment Canada, and used to drive the Modified ISBA (MISBA) of Kerkhoven and Gan (Adv Water Resour 29(6):808-826, 2006). In the ARB, the shortened snowfall season and increased sublimation together lead to a decline in the spring snowpack, and mean annual flows are expected to decline with the runoff coefficient dropping by about 8% per A degrees C rise in temperature. Although the wettest scenarios predict mild increases in annual runoff in the first half of the century, all GCM and emission combinations predict large declines by the end of the twenty-first century with an average change in the annual runoff, mean maximum annual flow and mean minimum annual flow of -21%, -4.4%, and -41%, respectively. The climate scenarios in the FRB present a less clear picture of streamflows in the twenty-first century. All 18 GCM projections suggest mean annual flows in the FRB should change by +/- 10% with eight projections suggesting increases and 10 projecting decreases in the mean annual flow. This stark contrast with the ARB results is due to the FRB's much milder climate. Therefore under SRES scenarios, much of the FRB is projected to become warmer than 0A degrees C for most of the calendar year, resulting in a decline in FRB's characteristic snow fed annual hydrograph response, which also results in a large decline in the average maximum flow rate. Generalized equations relating mean annual runoff, mean annual minimum flows, and mean annual maximum flows to changes in rainfall, snowfall, winter temperature, and summer temperature show that flow rates in both basins are more sensitive to changes in winter than summer temperature.",2011,10.1007/s10584-010-9958-7,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,WOS:000290449200004,Danny,No,Maybe,No,Ecosystem/Municipal,"Athabasca and Fraser River, CAN",NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Paris,No,Yes,No,Frasier River Basin,

However, use of this C source in stream food webs often is viewed as insignificant because of its relatively slow breakdown rates and low nutritional quality. We deployed leaf packs containing senesced bluejoint grass (Calamagrostis canadensis) across a natural nutrient gradient of 6 salmon-rearing headwater streams on the lower Kenai Peninsula, Alaska. We hypothesized that litter-colonizing microbes would use dissolved stream nutrients and enhance breakdown rates, litter nutrient concentrations, and densities of macroinvertebrates across streams. Leaf-pack mass and nutrient concentrations were measured on the material at 0 (predeployment), 2, 4, 6, and 8 wk in all streams. Breakdown rates were calculated from the mass measurements with an exponential decay model. Macroinvertebrate composition and abundance were measured at 8 wk in all streams and every 2 wk in 1 stream. Breakdown rates of bluejoint litter were relatively low (20-30% mass loss over 2 mo), but similar to rates found in previous studies of senesced grass litter. Weighted regressions showed that bluejoint breakdown rates in the 6 streams were significantly (p < 0.05) related to dissolved stream nutrient concentrations (r(2) = 0.94 and 0.67 for dissolved inorganic N and PO4-P, respectively), litter nutrient concentration (r(2) = 0.72 and 0.96 for leaf % N and % P. respectively), total macroinvertebrates/g (r(2) = 0.73), and nonmetric multidimensional scaling-axis-1 scores of macroinvertebrate community structure (r(2) = 0.80). Litter nutrients changed after just 2 wk and were increasingly and significantly related to stream nutrient concentrations over time. NMS ordination showed that succession of macroinvertebrates on leaf packs from one stream followed a distinct direction over time, and a large shift in macroinvertebrate community structure occurred between weeks 6 and 8, a result potentially indicating a consumer response to microbial conditioning. The abundance and diversity of macroinvertebrate taxa using bluejoint litter provide evidence that it is an important habitat and energy pathway for consumers in headwater streams of the Kenai Peninsula. In addition, climate change has the potential to change terrestrial vegetation assemblages, which drive differences in stream nutrient concentrations in this region. If N-fixing shrubs become more abundant in the future, litter-decomposition rates will be positively affected by increases in both stream and leaf-litter nutrient concentrations.",2011,10.1899/10-086.1,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,WOS:000290361600005,Danny,No,No,No,Ecosystem/Municipal,Kenai Pennisula,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Paris,No,Maybe,No,AK,

This would pose a great threat to high-elevation plant communities and resources. However, data to track this species in high-elevation environments are limited. To address changes in the distribution and abundance of downy brome and the factors most associated with its occurrence, we used field sampling and statistical methods, and niche modeling. In 2007, we resampled plots from two vegetation surveys in Rocky Mountain National Park for presence and cover of downy brome. One survey was established in 1993 and had been resampled in 1999. The other survey was established in 1996 and had not been resampled until our study. Although not all comparisons between years demonstrated significant changes in downy brome abundance, its mean cover increased nearly fivefold from 1993 (0.7%) to 2007 (3.6%) in one of the two vegetation surveys (P = 0.06). Although the average cover of downy brome within the second survey appeared to be increasing from 1996 to 2007, this slight change from 0.5% to 1.2% was not statistically significant (P = 0.24). Downy brome was present in 50% more plots in 1999 than in 1993 (P = 0.02) in the first survey. In the second survey, downy brome was present in 30% more plots in 2007 than in 1996 (P = 0.08). Maxent, a species environmental matching model, was generally able to predict occurrences of downy brome, as new locations were in the ranges predicted by earlier generated models. The model found that distance to roads, elevation, and vegetation community influenced the predictions most. The strong response of downy brome to interannual environmental variability makes detecting change challenging, especially with small sample sizes. However, our results suggest that the area in which downy brome occurs is likely increasing in Rocky Mountain National Park through increased frequency and cover.

Pollen and charcoal records spanning up to 15 000 years from ultramafic settings reveal a distinctly different vegetation history compared to other soil types. In non-ultramafic settings, the dominant trees and shrubs shifted in elevation in response to Holocene climate variations resulting in compositional and structural changes, whereas on ultramafic substrates changes were primarily structural, not compositional. Fire activity was similar through most of the Holocene with the exception of declines over the last 4000 years on ultramafic substrates, likely due to the reduction of understory fuels and cooler wetter conditions than in the middle Holocene. These results suggest that the tree and shrub distributions were more responsive to past climate changes on non-ultramafic substrates compared to those on ultramafic substrates.

We quantified range shifts by comparing distributional records from recent comprehensive field surveys (2006-2008) to earlier surveys (1927-1929) conducted at identical and nearby locations. Collector field notes from the historical surveys provided detailed trapping records and locality information, and museum specimens enabled confirmation of species' identifications. To ensure that observed shifts in range did not result from sampling bias, we employed a binomial likelihood model (introduced here) using likelihood ratios to calculate confidence intervals around observed range limits. Climate data indicate increases in both precipitation and summer maximum temperature between sampling periods. Increases in winter minimum temperatures were only evident at mid to high elevations. Consistent with predictions of change associated with climate warming, we document upslope range shifts for only two mesic-adapted species. In contrast, no xeric-adapted species expanded their ranges upslope. Rather, they showed either static distributions over time or downslope contraction or expansion.

Both species are susceptible to floods that can scour redds or kill fry, potentially decreasing population size the following summer. Winter (November-April) floods affect brook trout, and spring (May) floods affect rainbow trout. In this study, we applied a spatially distributed ecohydrologic model (RHESSys) to estimate how climate warming (+2 degrees C and +4 degrees C) and changes in precipitation are likely to impact flood flows in Sagehen Creek. Model estimates predict substantial changes in the temporal distribution of floods from spring to winter and an increase in the frequency and intensity of floods in both warming scenarios. Greater annual precipitation or precipitation intensity increases flood frequency but does not change the temporal distribution. Results show a seasonal shift from mostly spring floods under current conditions (54 spring and 12 winter flood-days) to almost entirely winter floods in the +4 degrees C warming scenario (5 spring and 83 winter flood-days), which would disproportionately impact brook trout populations. Given that this change in the timing of floods would probably be combined with greater flood intensity and higher stream temperatures, we argue that warming will likely cause a long-term decline in brook trout abundance. Conversely, fewer spring floods and potentially decreased competition with brook trout are likely to have a positive impact on the abundance of rainbow trout in Sagehen Creek, although increases in precipitation intensity would negatively impact both species.

Both species were most likely to occur at moderate UV-B levels. Ambystoma macrodactylum showed this pattern only in Glacier National Park. Occurrence of A. macrodactylum increased as UV-B increased in Olympic National Park despite UV-B levels similar to those recorded in Glacier. We also found marginal support for a negative association with UV-B for P. regilla in one of the two parks where it occurred. We did not find evidence of a negative UV-B effect for any other species.

Sediment yield is reconstructed on the basis of suites of dated and correlated cores from each lake. Facies analysis of the complete set of cores suggests that significant changes in sediment delivery have occurred during the Holocene, specifically a shift to a higher energy sedimentary environment in cooler wetter conditions in the late Holocene. Estimated sediment yields range between 2.3 and 11.2 t km(-2) a(-1). Maximum Holocene variability is a It 5% increase at one site. Highest variability is observed at sites just above treeline suggesting that reduced vegetation cover under cooler conditions is a key control on temporal variability of sediment yield at these sites. The temporal variability observed at Holocene timescales is within the range of natural spatial variability observed between the four closely spaced lakes. Overall, the results suggest that the response of small catchments to climate change is highly contingent upon local catchment conditions, and that at all but the most sensitive sites sediment yield changes associated with moderate climate warming are likely to be of a lesser magnitude than the natural spatial variability.

Both Pacific Northwest river-borne detritus, and sediment from piston coring site EW9504-17PC (2671 m water depth) offshore southern Oregon have been analyzed. Nd isotopic analyses of river silts show a range of 10 units in epsilon(Nd). North of the core site, the Columbia River has epsilon(Nd) = -7.6, while the Coos River has a value of epsilon(Nd) = -10.8. Rivers proximal to the core site have more radiogenic values from north to south, of epsilon(Nd) = -5.0 (Umpqua River), epsilon(Nd) = 1.3 (Rogue River), epsilon(Nd) -0.6 (Klamath River) and epsilon(Nd) = -3.0 (Eel River). Measured epsilon(Nd) in core sediments show subtle downcore changes, between epsilon(Nd) -0.9 and -2.5. The bulk sediment Ar-40-Ar-39 plateau ages show more notable downcore variation between 25 and 14 ka, ranging from 113.5 to 124.0 Ma, but are still within the range of bulk ages previously measured on river mouth sediments. The Nd isotopic analyses are combined with bulk sediment Ar-40-Ar-39 plateau ages into a ternary mixing model to quantitatively assess the sources of terrigenous material. Mixtures are best described by three sources proximal to the core site (the Umpqua, Rogue + Klamath and Eel Rivers) from similar to 14 ka to Present. Sediment deposited in the interval from 22 to 25 ka is not adequately described by the present-day rivers and requires an additional source. This additional source is best explained by an enhanced contribution from the interior Cascade volcanic arc, probably due to glaciation in the Cascade Range and the presence of pluvial Lake Modoc in the Upper Klamath Basin at this time. From 22 to 14 ka, the influence of Cascade Range sediment at the core site was overprinted by contemporaneous glaciation and sediment production in the Klamath Mountains, and possibly addition of sediment from the Eel River region as well. Thus, differential erosion appears to play a primary role in the provenance changes seen at the core site, and is more significant than sediment transport changes due to ocean circulation during this time period. Overall, the combined Ar-Nd isotopic technique provides insight into the coupling of land surface processes and ocean circulation related to climate change and will be a useful provenance tool in a variety of geologic/climatic settings.

The impact of alpine glaciation on tectonic activity is explored here. The predictions of previous analytical, critical wedge models are compared with the output of a numerical model that explicitly couples rock uplift produced by convergence with surface erosion. Glacial and fluvial and erosive processes are calculated over a two-dimensional grid, which uses an ice evolution model to calculate the rate of glacial erosion due to ice sliding. Tectonic uplift is determined by a two-dimensional finite element convergence model. The simulations performed support the predictions of previous one-dimensional analytical modeling of fluvially dominated orogens: Increasing precipitation decreases orogen width by the one quarter power. The simulations show that glacially dominated landscapes have similar dependencies. The total glacial erosion yield is determined to be proportional to the glacial coverage, sublinearly dependent on the precipitation rate, and linearly dependent on the glacial erosion constant that relates erosion with sliding speed. Climate also determines the distribution of tectonic uplift in the model. If the equilibrium line altitude ( ELA) is high and glacial processes are limited to peak regions, the center of the mountain range experiences the highest rate of rock uplift. Extensive glaciation increases rock uplift rates on the flanks of the range. The style of glacial erosion is also important: A simple glacial buzzsaw does not create the same tectonic response as models that physically simulate glacial erosion. The simulations support the idea that a climate cooling of the magnitude recorded in the late Cenozoic has the potential to more than double the rate of rock uplift in appropriate orogens. The implications of the model are discussed for observations from the Olympic Mountains of Washington State, the Southern Alps of New Zealand, the Alaskan coastal range, and the southern Andes.",2007,10.1029/2005JF000332,Geology,WOS:000246496600001,Meghan,No,,No,,little mention of climate change,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Paris,No,Yes,No,"Ak, Andes, NZ",

We also compared patterns between the two taxonomic groups with reference to their life-history characteristics. Location Data for our analyses were collected from 1996 to 2003 in three adjacent mountain ranges in the central Great Basin (Lander and Nye counties, Nevada, USA): the Shoshone Mountains, Toiyabe Range and Toquima Range. Methods Data on species composition for both taxonomic groups were collecting using standard inventory methods for birds and butterflies in temperate regions. Data were compiled at three sampling grains, sites (average 12 ha), canyons (average 74 ha) and mountain ranges. For each sampling grain in turn, we calculated similarity of species composition using the Jaccard index. First, we investigated whether mean similarity of species composition among the three ranges differed as a function of the grain size at which data were compiled. Secondly, we explored whether mean similarity of species composition was greater for canyons within the same mountain range than for canyons within different mountain ranges. Thirdly, we examined whether mean similarity of species composition at the site level was different for sites within the same canyon, sites within different canyons in the same mountain range, and sites within canyons in different mountain ranges. We used a Bayesian model to analyse these comparisons. Results For both taxonomic groups, mean similarity of species composition increased as the sampling grain increased. The effect of spatial grain was somewhat greater for birds than for butterflies, especially when the intermediate sampling grain was compared with the smallest sampling grain. Similarity of species composition of butterflies at each sampling grain was greater than similarity of species composition of birds at the same grain. Mean similarity of species composition of both birds and butterflies at the canyon level and site level was affected by relative proximity of sampling locations; beta diversity increased as the relative isolation of sampling locations increased. Main conclusion The sensitivity of beta diversity to sampling grain likely reflects the effect of local environmental heterogeneity: as sampling grain increases, biotic assemblages appear more homogeneous. Although breeding birds in our study system have larger home ranges than resident butterflies, birds may have more specialized resource requirements related to vegetation structure and composition, especially at small sampling scales. The degree of variation in species composition of both taxonomic groups suggests that spatially extensive sampling will be more effective for drawing inferences about regional patterns of species diversity than intensive sampling at relatively few, smaller sites.",2004,10.1111/j.1365-2699.2004.01089.x,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Physical Geography,WOS:000221300100006,Meghan,No,,No,,,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Paris,No,Yes,No,Great Basin,

To this end, an experiment was conducted in which a set of soil cores was reciprocally transplanted between adjacent forest (low nitrification potential) and meadow (high nitrification potential) environments, at two high-elevation (similar to1500 m) sites in the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest located in the Cascade Mountains of Oregon. Half of the cores were placed in screened PVC pipe (closed) to prevent new root colonization, large litter debris inputs, and animal disturbance; the other cores were placed in open mesh bags. A duplicate set of open and closed soil cores was not transferred between sites and was incubated in place. Over the 2-year experiment, net nitrification increased in both open and closed cores transferred from forest to meadow, and to a lesser extent in cores remaining in the forest. In three of four forest soil treatments, net nitrification increases were accompanied by increases in nitrification potential rates (NPR) and 10- to 100-fold increases in AOB populations. In open cores remaining in the forests, however, increases in net nitrification were not accompanied by significant increases in either NPR or AOB populations. Although some meadow soil treatments reduced both net nitrification and nitrification potential rates, significant changes were not detected in most probable number (MPN)-based estimates of AOB population densities. Terminal restriction fragment profiles (T-RFs) of a PCR-amplified 491-bp fragment of the ammonia monooxygenase subunit A gene (amoA) changed significantly in response to some soil treatments, and treatment effects differed among locations and between years. A T-RF previously shown to be a specific biomarker of Nitrosospira cluster 4 (Alu390) was widespread and dominant in the majority of soil samples.

The EPA has the responsibility for setting public health and safety and environmental standards for radioactive waste disposal at Yucca Mountain and it is the NRC's responsibility to implement those standards in its regulations to ensure public health and safety and the environment are protected. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), as the developer of the potential repository, must submit a license application to the NRC to seek approval to construct the repository. DOE must comply with NRC's regulations for NRC to authorize construction and license operation of a potential repository at Yucca Mountain. In 2005, EPA issued proposed revised standards and NRC issued proposed revised regulations for conducting performance assessment beyond 10,000 years up to 1 million years. The challenge for the EPA and NRC is to develop standards and regulations that provide an appropriate method for evaluating the safety of the potential repository given the unprecedented time period to be analyzed and the inherent uncertainties in estimating the future evolution of the Yucca Mountain site and the containment of the waste in the waste packages. A fundamental aspect of the proposed EPA standard is the specified approach for limiting undue speculation on future behavior of the site by constraining the features, events, and processes that need to be considered in the performance assessment. EPA proposed to limit the assessment of specific features, events, and processes in the period after 10,000 years to effects on the repository system that are most relevant (i.e., ignoring lesser or secondary effects that may add to speculation and uncertainties but would not be expected to have a significant effect on peak dose over a 1 million year period). For example, DOE's performance assessment may (1) limit the analysis of seismic activity to the effects caused by damage to the drifts and the waste package; (2) Emit analysis of igneous activity to effects on the waste package that result in release of radionuclides to the atmosphere or ground water; (3) require DOE to include general corrosion in its analysis of engineered barrier performance, and (4) limit the effect of climate variation to those resulting from increased water flowing to the repository. NRC has been reviewing its performance assessment models and techniques to assure they are consistent with EPA's proposed requirements for the period after 10,000 years and adequate to assist the review of a potential license application from the DOE. Currently, only slight modifications to the models and approaches used in the performance assessment for the initial 10,000 years are expected to be needed to accommodate calculations for longer times (e.g., modifications to implement a steady-state value to represent the proposed climate change). NRC staff will be able to use the modified performance assessment to identify additional sensitivities associated with estimating doses over very long time periods and improve its understanding of the performance of a potential repository at Yucca Mountain.",2007,,Materials Science,WOS:000250805600015,Meghan,No,Maybe,No,,Nuclear waste disposal (Yucca Mt.

Average net balance rates ranged between - 3.1 to 0.16 m yr(-1) for the tidewater and - 1.5 to -0.02 m yr(-1) for the nontidewater glaciers. We tested several methods for extrapolating these measurements to all the glaciers of the western Chugach Mountains using a process similar to cross validation. Predictions of individual glacier changes appear to be difficult, probably because of the effects of glacier dynamics, which on long ( multidecadal) timescales, complicates the response of glaciers to climate. In contrast, estimates of regional contributions to rising sea level were similar for different methods, mainly because the large glaciers, whose changes dominated the regional total, were among those measured. For instance, the above sea level net balance rate of Columbia glacier ( - 3.1 +/- 0.08 km(3) yr(-1) water equivalent ( weq) or an equivalent rise in sea level ( SLE) of 0.0090 +/- 0.0002 mm yr(-1)) was nearly half of the total regional net balance rate of the western Chugach Mountain glaciers ( -7.4 +/- 1.1 km(3) yr(-1) weq or 0.020 +/- 0.003 mm yr(-1) SLE between 1950/ 1957 and 2001/ 2004).

Rates and mechanisms of mass wasting depend on lithology, bedrock structure, and climatic and tectonic setting. These factors tend to vary significantly in active tectonic regions, thus clouding our ability to predict how landsliding modulates topographic development over human and geological time scales. Here, we use a novel DEM-based technique to document the distribution of large landslides in the Oregon Coast Range (OCR) and quantify how they affect topographic relief. We developed an automated algorithm that exploits the distinctive topographic signature (specifically the relationship between curvature and gradient) of large landslides to map their distribution within the gently folded Tyee Formation (Eocene deltaic-submarine ramp sediments). In contrast to steep and highly dissected terrain frequently identified as characteristic of the OCR (which exhibits steep, planar side slopes and highly curved, low-gradient ridge tops and valleys), terrain prone to large landslides tends to have low values of both drainage density and curvature and gradient values that cluster between 0.16 and 0.44. The distribution of failure-dominated terrain in our 10,000 km(2) study area is influenced by systematic variations in sedimentary facies and bedrock structure. The fraction of terrain altered by large landslides (> 0.1 km(2)) varies from 5% in the sand-rich (delta-slope and proximal ramp facies) southern section of our study area to similar to 25% in the north (distal ramp facies), coincident with an increase in the thickness of siltstone beds and a decrease in the sandstone: siltstone ratio. Local relief declines progressively northward, suggesting that deep-seated landsliding is sensitive to the thickness and frequency of low-shear-strength siltstone beds and may serve to limit topographic development in the OCR. Structural controls are superimposed on facies-related variations as deep-seated landslides are frequently found on slopes whose downslope aspect corresponds to the bedrock dip direction. For 1516 strike and dip measurements in our study area, we calculated the fraction of proximal terrain (< 2.5 km) altered by deep-seated landsliding. In the sand-rich southern region, the proportion of proximal slide-dominated terrain increases modestly with bedrock dip. In the silt-rich northern region, terrain altered by deep-seated landsliding is pervasive, and an increase in dip from 01 to 161 corresponds to a change in the fraction of slide-prone terrain from 10% to 28%. Our technique for mapping large landslides has utility for hazard analysis and land management. Over million-year time scales, the progradational character of the Tyee Formation suggests that continued uplift and exhumation of the OCR should result in a southward propagation of slide-prone, silt-rich distal facies. As a result, deep-seated landsliding will become increasingly prominent, and topographic relief in the central and southern OCR will progressively decline. Whereas spatial variability in climatic or tectonic forcing is often invoked to explain systematic variations in topographic development, our results emphasize the importance of structural and intraformation lithologic controls on landsliding. As such, analyses linking surface processes, climate, tectonics, and landscapes should be couched in the context of diverse geologic and topographic data.",2005,10.1130/B25567.1,Geology,WOS:000228824500006,Meghan,No,Maybe,No,,no mention of climate change,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Paris,,,No,"Coast Range, OR",

Such suggestions rely on a variety of observations that include paleobotanical finds of plant organs resembling those of taxa that now live lower, recent increases in exhumation, erosion, incision, and/or sediment-accumulation rates, ""juvenile landscapes,"" and in some cases no supporting data at all (presumably because the inference has become so widely accepted that supporting evidence is no longer needed). Regions of allegedly recent ""uplift"" include obviously active belts like the Himalaya and seemingly tectonically dead terrain such as Transantarctic Mountains of Antarctica, the Rocky Mountains of the Western USA, or any part of Australia, as well as belts, like the western Alps, which might be called senile, if not dead yet because rigor mortis has not yet set in.

Since a dispute on this problem has been put forward by MOLNAR & ENGLAND (1990) postulating that tectonically forced late Neogene global mountain uplift may be fiction, time has come for a global-scale compilation of data from regional studies. Whereas until similar to1992 only indirect evidence of surface uplift has been available, new methods developing since then claim, e. g., to reflect elevation-dependent paleo-pressure of gas in basalt vesicles or paleo-elevation of precipitation as reflected by oxygen isotope composition of fossils and caliche crusts. Major pulses of uplift in global scale occur around 17, 10, 5, and 2.7 Ma. Evidence from large plateaus, which are driven up solely by tectonic forces, indicates earlier uplift, e.g. for parts of the Tibetan plateau, than previously assumed. The southern and central parts of the Tibetian plateau attained modem elevation before middle Miocene times, possibly even in Oligocene times. Time constraints for surface uplift of individual narrow Alpine-type mountain ranges remain vague. Increasing mountain glaciations since the late Pliocene and potentially increasing zonal wind speed in the westerlies, forcing orographic precipitation, accelerated valley erosion. Thus, increase of local relief and isostatically forced mountain top uplift is partly driven by climate and enhanced by positive feedback. The causal role of climate change for global late Miocene uplift of Alpine-type mountain chaines remains controversail, whereas an important role since 2.7 Ma, related to the onset of cyclic glaciations, is fairly established.

We measured response functions linking carbon (C) assimilation and temperature- and moisture-related microclimatic factors for limber pine (Pinus flexilis) seedlings growing in a heatingxwatering experiment within and above the alpine treeline. We then extrapolated these response functions using observed microclimate conditions to estimate the net effects of warming and associated soil drying on C assimilation across an entire growing season.

Warming above current treeline conditions provided relatively little benefit to modeled net assimilation, whereas assimilation was sensitive to either wetter or drier conditions.

Manipulative experiments at elevations above the invasive range of non-native species can clarify the relative contributions of these mechanisms to montane invasion resistance, yet such experiments are rare. Furthermore, global climate change and land use changes are expected to cause decreases in snowpack and increases in disturbance by fire and forest thinning in montane forests. We examined the importance of these factors in limiting montane invasions using a field transplant experiment above the invasive range of two non-native lowland shrubs, Scotch broom (Cytisus scoparius) and Spanish broom (Spartium junceum), in the rain-snow transition zone of the Sierra Nevada of California. We tested the effects of canopy closure, prescribed fire, and winter snow depth on demographic transitions of each species. Establishment of both species was most likely at intermediate levels of canopy disturbance, but at this intermediate canopy level, snow depth had negative effects on winter survival of seedlings. We used matrix population models to show that an 86% reduction in winter snowfall would cause a 2.8-fold increase in population growth rates in Scotch broom and a 3.5-fold increase in Spanish broom. Fall prescribed fire increased germination rates, but decreased overall population growth rates by reducing plant survival. However, at longer fire return intervals, population recovery between fires is likely to keep growth rates high, especially under low snowpack conditions. Many treatment combinations had positive growth rates despite being above the current invasive range, indicating that propagule pressure, disturbance, and climate can all strongly affect plant invasions in montane regions. We conclude that projected reductions in winter snowpack and increases in forest disturbance are likely to increase the risk of invasion from lower elevations.",2015,10.1111/gcb.12824,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WOS:000353977500024,Micah,No,Yes,No,,CA,Adrienne,No,Maybe,No,,,NA,,,,,Paris,No,,No,CA,

This study examined how flow processes during snowmelt runoff affected spatial patterns of soil moisture on two steep sub-alpine hillslope transects in Rocky Mountain National Park, CO, USA. The transects have northeast-facing and east-facing aspects, and both extend from high-elevation bedrock outcrops down to streams in valley bottoms. Spatial patterns of both snow depth and near-surface soil moisture were surveyed along these transects in the snowmelt and summer seasons of 2008-2010. To link these patterns to flow processes, soil moisture was measured continuously on both transects and compared with the timing of discharge in nearby streams. Results indicate that both slopes generated shallow lateral subsurface flow during snowmelt through near-surface soil, colluvium and bedrock fractures. On the northeast-facing transect, this shallow subsurface flow emerged through mid-slope seepage zones, in some cases producing saturation overland flow, whereas the east-facing slope had no seepage zones or overland flow. At the hillslope scale, earlier snowmelt timing on the east-facing slope led to drier average soil moisture conditions than on the northeast-facing slope, but within hillslopes, snow patterns had little relation to soil moisture patterns except in areas with persistent snow drifts. Results suggest that lateral flow and exfiltration processes are key controls on soil moisture spatial patterns in this steep sub-alpine location.

It also inhabits green forest but little is known about occurrence and habitat use patterns outside of burned areas, especially in the Sierra Nevada of California, USA. We used point count and playback surveys to detect Black-backed Woodpeckers during 2011 -2013 on 460 transects on 10 national forest units. We defined green forest as areas that had not burned at moderate or high severity since 1991 and were more than 2 km from areas burned at moderate or high severity within the previous eight years (n = 386 transects). We used occupancy models to examine green forest habitat associations and found positive relationships with elevation, latitude, northern aspects, number of snags, tree diameter, lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) forest, and a negative relationship with slope. Estimated occupancy in green forest was higher than previously understood (0.21). In addition site colonization and extinction probability in green forest were low (0.05 and 0.19, respectively) and suggest that many of the individuals detected in green forest were not just actively dispersing across the landscape in search of burned areas, but were occupying relatively stable home ranges. The association with high elevation and lodgepole pine forest may increase their exposure to climate change as these elevation forest types are predicted to decrease in extent over the next century. Although density is high in burned forest, green forest covers significantly more area in the Sierra Nevada and should be considered in efforts to conserve this rare species.",2014,10.5751/ACE-00671-090203,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Zoology,WOS:000347923600001,Micah,No,Yes,No,,CA,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Paris,No,Maybe,No,CA,

However, comparative studies of avian communities exploring the factors that currently shape species richness patterns rarely analyze relationships across neighboring ecological regions of the same mountain chain. Evaluations of the intrinsic regional differences in species-environment relationships are needed to better inform expectations of how bird communities may be affected by future climate change. In this study, we evaluated the relative importance of three environmental factors (temperature, precipitation, and net primary productivity) in structuring avian richness patterns along a continuous mega-transect. We followed the route of the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) (32.58 degrees N to 42.00 degrees N, ranging in elevation from 365 to 4020 m) on the California cordillera and completed avian point counts on 3578 systematically established survey plots. We divided this mega-transect into five sections, which corresponded to distinct ecological regions along the mountain chain. Regions differed both for elevation-richness patterns, exhibiting linear and unimodal trends, and for model-supported environmental drivers of patterns, with some richness-environment correlations changing sign across adjacent regions. These results were robust to sampling bias, regional species availability, and spatial autocorrelation. Although seasonal variation in avian movements may have limited influence on our results, we conclude that intrinsic regional environments affect bird species richness differently in each of these sections on the PCT, thus creating region-specific species-environment relationships. Appreciation of regional environmental heterogeneity will only increase in light of forecasted climate change, where regional predictions often diverge greatly from global trends, necessitating a site-specific approach to climate adaptation rather than 'one size fits all' strategies.",2014,10.5751/ACE-00695-090208,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Zoology,WOS:000347923600007,Micah,No,Yes,No,,CA,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Paris,No,Yes,No,CA,

We conducted morphological studies on 201 conifer cones and cone fragments recovered from Pleistocene sediments at the Ziegler Reservoir fossil site (2705 m) near Snowmass Village, Colorado. The basin, formed similar to 155-130 ka, contains fossil-bearing lacustrine, palustrine, and colluvial sediments spanning approximately 85 ka. Using a suite of morphological characters, particularly cone-scale bracts, we differentiated species of Abies, Picea, and Pseudotsuga. All fossil Abies specimens were assignable based on bract morphology to Abies concolor, which is currently absent from central Colorado (nearest populations are 160 km southwest of the site). A. concolor occurs only in sediments of MIS 5d and 5c. Pseudotsuga menziesii and Picea engelmannii cones occurred in sediments corresponding to MIS 5e, 5d, 5c, and 5a. A fourth conifer species, occurring in sediments of MIS 5e, 5d, 5c, and 5a, is difficult to assign to any extant species. Bract morphology is similar to Picea pungens, which grows near the site today, but scale morphology is unlike P. pungens.

Additional stressors such as climate change and limber pine dwarf mistletoe (Aceuthobium cyanocarpum) may significantly alter stand structure and biodiversity of these ecosystems. The objectives of this study were to: (1) assess site, stand, and tree health conditions in limber pine stands of northern Colorado, Wyoming, and southeastern Montana, (2) quantify impacts of WPBR, bark beetles, and dwarf mistletoe, and (3) determine biotic and abiotic factors that influence the occurrence and incidence of these damage agents. We assessed 22,700 limber pines on 508 plots in limber pine-dominated stands in twenty-five study areas in northern Colorado, Wyoming, and southeastern Montana. Average live limber pine density was 311 stems ha(-1). Overall, 50% of limber pines were classified as healthy with over 50% of limber pine mortality attributed to bark beetle attacks. White pine blister rust damage was evident on over 60% of declining or dying limber pines. Blister rust was the primary damage agent, occurring on 73% of the plots and 26% of the trees. Bark beetle-caused mortality was found on 75% of plots and 18% of trees. Limber pine dwarf mistletoe was present on 29% of plots and 9% of trees. In study areas that were previously monitored, incidence of WPBR increased over 8-9 years by 6%, bark beetle-caused mortality by 17%, while dwarf mistletoe incidence remained the same. We used statistical modeling to determine meteorological, macro and micro site factors, and stand factors that influenced the occurrence and incidence of WPBR, bark beetles, and dwarf mistletoe on limber pines. Declines in health and rise in mortality due to bark beetles and WPBR has left some study areas with low limber pine basal area and stand density. These stands may be at risk for localized extirpation if the minimum viable population thresholds are not maintained and are identified as areas of concern for restoration and conservation efforts. Current condition status and long-term monitoring of limber pine is needed for land manager decision making and facilitation of restoration goals.

These allochthonous inputs regulate many ecosystem characteristics. In inland waters, terrestrial inputs of organic matter regulate food-web structure, ecosystem metabolism, water clarity, and thermal stratification. Future changes in allochthony may be especially pronounced in high-elevation ecosystems due to increases in vegetation and precipitation associated with climate change. Several techniques exist to characterize the degree of allochthony of organic matter in aquatic systems, including metrics such as (H), the net isotopic discrimination between water and particulate organic matter (POM) of deuterium stable isotopes, and the fluorescence index (FI), which characterizes the fluorescence of dissolved organic matter (DOM). Despite the importance of allochthonous organic carbon inputs, little is known about either how allochthony varies across elevation gradients or whether different metrics are similarly related to allochthony. We measured (H), FI, and a suite of related water-quality characteristics in 30 lakes across a montane to alpine elevation gradient (2340 to 3205 m) in the Beartooth Mountains of Montana and Wyoming, USA, to understand how FI and (H) varied with elevation, with one another, and with other allochthony-related water-quality characteristics. We hypothesized that allochthony of POM and DOM would decrease at higher elevations, with alpine lakes above treeline being more autochthonous compared with low-elevation lakes below treeline. We observed a significant inverse linear relationship between (H) and FI, with both metrics indicating a decrease in allochthony at higher elevations. Characteristics including the natural log of the ratio of concentrations of dissolved organic carbon to chlorophyll a (ln(DOC:Chl)), the spectral slope ratio between different spectra of two wavebands (S-R, ratio of spectra at 275-295 to 350-400 nm), and a ratio of diffuse attenuation coefficients at 320 and 380 nm (K-R, K-d320:K-d380) varied with both (H) and FI while pH varied only with (H). High-elevation systems were characterized by low ln(DOC:Chl) and K-R, and high S-R and pH. These results indicate that high-elevation lakes are more autochthonous than low-elevation lakes.

With little room ""at the top"" to track shifting climate envelopes, alpine species may be especially negatively affected by climate-induced habitat fragmentation. We ask how climate change will affect the total amount, mean patch size, and number of patches of suitable habitat for Vancouver Island White-tailed Ptarmigan (Lagopus leucura saxatilis; VIWTP), a threatened, endemic alpine bird. Using a Random Forest model and a unique dataset consisting of citizen science observations combined with field surveys, we predict the distribution and configuration of potential suitable summer habitat for VIWTP under baseline and future (2020s, 2050s, and 2080s) climates using three general circulation models and two greenhouse gas scenarios. VIWTP summer habitat is predicted to decline by an average of 25%, 44%, and 56% by the 2020s, 2050s, and 2080s, respectively, under the low greenhouse gas scenario and 27%, 59%, and 74% under the high scenario. Habitat patches are predicted to become fragmented, with a 5279% reduction in mean patch size. The average elevation of suitable habitat patches is expected to increase, reflecting a loss of patches at lower elevations. Thus ptarmigan are in danger of being ""squeezed off the mountain"", as their remaining suitable habitat will be increasingly confined to mountaintops in the center of the island. The extent to which ptarmigan will be able to persist in increasingly fragmented habitat is unclear. Much will depend on their ability to move throughout a more heterogeneous landscape, utilize smaller breeding areas, and survive increasingly variable climate extremes. Our results emphasize the importance of continued monitoring and protection for high elevation specialist species, and suggest that White-tailed Ptarmigan should be considered an indicator species for alpine ecosystems in the face of climate change.",2015,10.1371/journal.pone.0142110,Science & Technology - Other Topics,WOS:000364032600101,Paris,No,Yes,No,,CO,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Paris,No,Yes,No,"Vancouver, IS",

In complex terrain, these differences are amplified; yet it is in these environments that remotely sensed LST may be most valuable in prediction and characterization of spatial-temporal patterns of Tair due to typical paucity of meteorological stations in mountainous regions. This study presents an analysis on the suitability and limitations of using LST as a proxy or an input variable for predicting Tair in complex mountainous topography. Explicitly, we investigated the influence of key environmental, topographic, and instrumental factors on the relation between LST and measured Tair in two mountainous ecoregions of Nevada. The relation between LST and Tair was found to be strongest during late summer and fall, and weakest during winter and early spring. Increasing terrain roughness was found to diminish the relation between between LST and Tair. There was a strong agreement between nighttime Tair lapse rates and LST lapse rates. Given the inadequacy of several gridded Tair products in capturing minimum temperature cold-air pooling and inversions, using LST as an input variable in the interpolation process would enhance capture of temperature inversions in gridded data over complex terrain.

Most studies of high-elevation lakes in the North Cascades have used a landscape-scale approach to describe aquatic systems, but smaller scale research is needed to examine natural variation in these types of lakes. We conducted a watershed-scale study encompassing four close-proximity lakes near Mt. Baker (Whatcom Co., WA) in order to examine the variation in phytoplankton and water quality in these lakes. The lakes were sampled weekly during the ice-free season of 2012 to measure seasonal changes. Chlorophyll-a levels were < 2.0 mu g L-1, confirming the oligotrophic nature of these lakes. Nitrogen limitation was indicated by median DIN:TP < 3 at all sites, along with significant correlations between chlorophyll-a and nitrogen. The phytoplankton were represented by 49 genera (79 unique taxa), which was comparable to landscape-scale studies of North Cascades lakes. Ordination of phytoplankton samples separated the lakes into two groups: one group dominated by diatoms and the other dominated by Chlorophyta, Cyanobacteria, and Ochrophyta. The diatom group was associated with lower water temperatures and total nitrogen concentrations, and higher pH, dissolved oxygen, nitrate, and phosphate concentrations. Results aligned with differences in the lakes' external physical environments, including lakeshore vegetation and ice-melt timing.

Talus matrices (subsurfaces) had low daily variances and, in the warm season, remained cool during the hottest times of the day relative to surfaces and free air. During winter, matrices were warmer than free air. Talus surfaces were warmer than free air in the warm and cold seasons, and had large daily variances. Summer forefield and dispersal environments were warmest of all habitat components. Talus surfaces in summer were highly responsive to solar radiation over the course of the day, warming quickly to high midday temperatures, and cooling rapidly in the evening.

Both phase transitions and energy increases had significant, though unique, impacts on semi-arid mountain hydrology in our simulations. A complete shift in precipitation from snow to rain reduced streamflow between 11% and 18%, while 4 degrees C of uniform warming reduced streamflow between 19% and 23%, suggesting that changes in energy-driven evaporative loss, between 27% and 29% for these uniform warming scenarios, may be the dominant driver of annual mean streamflow in a warming climate.

It has, for example, been suggested that the locations of ecotones, transitions between adjacent ecosystems or biomes, should be monitored. It is assumed that changes in climate, especially increases in atmospheric temperature, will result in shifts in the location (altitude or latitude) of ecotones as plants respond to the newly imposed climatic conditions. In this article, we address the use of two montane ecotones, the alpine tree-line ecotone and the deciduous/Boreal forest ecotone, in monitoring global climatic change. In so doing, we 1) outline the factors that create and maintain each ecotone's position at a given location; 2) assess the projected response of the ecotones to various aspects of global warming; and 3) discuss the usefulness of both ecotones as indicators of global climate change. While it is likely that extended periods of directional climate change would bring about an altitudinal shift in the ranges of montane species and the associated ecotones, we question whether the response at either ecotone will be at a timescale useful for detecting climate change (a few decades) owing to disequilibrium related to upslope edaphic limitations and competitive interactions with established canopy and subcanopy individuals. Further, limitations related to the prediction of the complex and interacting effects of projected changes in temperature, precipitation and site water balance on photosynthetic processes of plant species raise uncertainties about the expected responses of both ecotones.",1996,10.1177/030913339602000301,Physical Geography; Geology,WOS:A1996VK72300001,Shana,Maybe,Maybe,No,,Conceptual--about ecotones globally,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Paris,Maybe,Yes,No,"Includes Glacier NP, non specific",

The Canadian Centre for Climate Modeling Analysis General Circulation Model (CGCMa1) has been used to estimate changes in the precipitation and temperature. The UBC Watershed Model (Version 4,0) was used to simulate the discharge of the two study watersheds and to identify the causes of peak flows. In the simulations, apart from changes in precipitation and temperature, changes in the spatial distribution of precipitation with elevation, cloud cover, glacier extension, vegetation distribution, vegetation biomass production. and plant physiology were considered. The results showed that the future climate for the two study watersheds would be wetter and warmer than the present climate. The majority of the flood events in the coastal rainfed watershed of Upper Campbell are and would be generated by fall rainfall events and winter rain-on-snow events, whereas in the interior snowcovered Illecillewaet basin the floods are and would be produced by spring rain and snowmelt events and summer events. The analysis indicated that the overall flood magnitude and frequency of occurrence in the Upper Campbell watershed would increase. On the other hand, the number and the magnitude of the flood flows would decrease under the future climatic conditions in the Illecillewaet basin. Based on these findings, different management practices should be applied in the two watersheds to overcome the effects of the future climate change. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Both epeirogenic uplift and climate change (with no associated uplift) have been proposed as the cause of this subcontinental-scale erosional episode. However, the lack of a well-defined Cenozoic paleoelevation history for the region has hampered our ability to distinguish between the two. A tilt analysis of the Cheyenne Tablelands in the western Great Plains of Wyoming and Nebraska provides us with a datum from which postdepositional changes in slope can be determined. Miocene to earliest Pliocene gravels of the Ogallala Group (17.5-5 Ma) cap the tablelands, which currently tilt down to the east at slopes as great as 10(-2). However, paleohydraulic analysis of the Ogallala gravels indicates depositional Slopes of 10(-3) to 10(-4), implying a postdepositional increase in tilt. If a hinge point at the eastern edge of the Cheyenne Tablelands is assumed, this tilt translates into differential uplift of 680 m (815-410 m) at the western edge of the Great Plains. Flexural isostatic rebound of the tablelands due to known young erosion in surrounding basins only produces a few hundred meters of uplift. Therefore, even if all of the recent erosion in the region can be attributed to climate change, the resulting rebound is insufficient to account for the observed uplift of the tablelands. Thus, the tilting of the Cheyenne Tablelands is most consistent with broad-wavelength tectonic uplift centered under the Rocky Mountains initiated during Ogallala deposition and continuing since deposition ceased.",2002,10.1130/0091-7613(2002)030<0063:PTOTMP>2.0.CO;2,Geology,WOS:000173495200016,Shana,No,Yes,No,,Great Plains,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Paris,No,Maybe,No,Great Plains,

Rapidly changing climates are superimposed on other ecosystem stresses such as urbanization, air pollution, habitat fragmentation, loss of native biodiversity, and the invasion of exotic species. Climate influences the frequency and intensity of disturbance (e.g. fire and insect outbreaks), species distribution patterns, hydrological patterns, and forest condition. I present examples of research and monitoring activities on Department of the Interior lands, primarily in the western United States. Evidence of regional warming comes from rapidly disappearing glaciers in Montana, lake level decline in Crater Lake, Oregon, and expansion of high-elevation forests in Colorado and Washington. I also present evidence of regional cooling in the summer months due to land-use changes in the plains of Colorado, where crop irrigation and landscaping have influenced the climate, hydrology, and forest vegetation patterns in the adjacent Rocky Mountains. In some areas, the effects of land-use practices on regional climate may overshadow larger-scale temperature changes commonly associated with observed increases in CO2 and other greenhouse gases. Our understanding of rapid climate change, and other equally important multiple stresses to forest condition, is aided by strong ecosystem research and long-term monitoring programs.

In particular, frost-cracking depends largely upon the time spent within a range of subzero temperatures I call the frost cracking window. I present simple analytic solutions, detailed time series of thermal data from a field site, and a numerical model of subsurface temperatures that constrain the expected depth dependence of frost cracking. Analytic solutions using sinusoidal surface temperature histories result in predicted vertical profiles of frost-cracking intensity that depend upon the location of the frost-cracking window within the range of surface temperatures. In some cases, the expected frost cracking intensity decreases monotonically with depth, while in others it displays a distinct maximum at depth. I use hourly temperatures measured over the I-yr interval April 1995 through March 1996, at 8 depths up to 42 cm into a granitic bedrock surface in the Laramie Range, Wyoming, to constrain an in situ thermal diffusivity of 1.7 mm(2) s(-1). These temperature histories suggest that frost cracking at this site should decrease monotonically with depth into the rock. I also use this time series of temperatures to calibrate a numerical thermal model in which the top boundary condition is set by a surface radiation balance. The data require both a low albedo of the rock surface (0.1), and a high atmospheric transmissivity (0.9). I then explore the expected near-surface temperatures at other sites by running the model with different annual mean temperatures, latitudes, and slopes. The resulting simulations suggest that at lower mean annual temperatures, as are found in higher latitude and altitude sites, the frost cracking maximum should both amplify and deepen into the subsurface.",1998,10.2307/1552008,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography,WOS:000077512900005,Shana,No,,No,,"Laramie, WY",NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Paris,No,,No,WY,

Western hemlock pollen first occurs at approximately 3500 C-14 years BP. The migration path of western hemlock into this region is currently unclear. Data from palynological records appear insufficient to resolve the migration pattern, although several routes are possible.

The goal of the effort was to produce a computational model that can be coupled to the project's calibrated 3D site-scale flow model so that the results of that effort could be incorporated directly into the Total System Performance Assessment (TSPA) analyses. The transport model simulates multiple species (typically 20 or more) with complex time-varying and spatially varying releases from the potential repository. Water-table rise, climate-change scenarios, and decay chains are additional features of the model. A cell-based particle-tracking method was employed that includes a dual-permeability formulation, advection, longitudinal dispersion, matrix diffusion, and colloid-facilitated transport. This paper examines the transport behavior of several key radionuclides through the unsaturated zone using the calibrated 3D unsaturated flow fields. Computational results illustrate the relative importance of fracture flow, matrix diffusion, and lateral diversion on the distribution of travel times from the simulated repository to the water table for various climatic conditions. Results also indicate rapid transport through fractures for a portion of the released mass. Further refinement of the model will address several issues, including conservatism in the transport model, the assignment of parameters in the flow and transport models, and the underlying assumptions used to support the conceptual models of flow and transport in the unsaturated zone at Yucca Mountain.

We dated fires using tree rings ( 18 sites) and 120 soil-charcoal radiocarbon dates (65 sites). Comparisons among multiple radiocarbon dates indicated a high probability that the charcoal dated at each site represented the most recent fire, though we expect greater error in TSF estimates at sites where charcoal was very old (>6000 yr) and was restricted to mineral soil horizons. TSF estimates ranged from 64 to similar to12 220 yr; 45% of the sites have burned in the last 1000 yr, whereas 2017( of the sites have not burned for over 6000 yr.

Comparison of fire dates among neighboring sites indicated that fires rarely extended >250 m.

In contrast, the early Holocene regional climate and forest composition likely resulted in larger landscape tires that were not strongly controlled by landform factors.

Using a geographic information system (GIS), we determined latitude, elevation, and land use attributes for all sites and analyzed the spatial pattern of declines. We then compared the observed patterns of decline to those predicted by the climate change, UV-B radiation, pesticides, and habitat alteration hypotheses for amphibian decline. Declines were not consistent with the climate change hypothesis but showed a strong positive association with elevation, percentage upwind agricultural land use, and local urbanization. These results apply to patterns of decline across the entire range of R. a. draytonii in California, as well as within geographic subregions. The elevational gradient in declines is consistent with the UV-B hypothesis, although the UV-B hypothesis also predicts a north-to-south gradient in declines, which we did not observe. The association of declines with the amount of upwind agricultural land use strongly suggests that wind-borne agrochemicals may be an important factor in declines.

These variables might reasonably be expected to affect species richness of butterflies and can be derived readily for most landscapes. We also explored how climate change may affect species distributions in both mountain ranges. Location Field research was conducted in the Toiyabe and Toquima ranges, Lander and Nye counties, Nevada, USA. Methods We obtained data for 102 locations in the Toiyabe Range and 49 locations in the Toquima Range. These locations covered an elevational gradient of c.1350 m in the Toiyabe Range and 900 m in the Toquima Range. Species richness data were based upon comprehensive field inventories. Elevation was measured by differentially corrected global positioning systems. Values for the remaining predictive variables were derived using geographic information systems. Availability of surface water was quantified as the distance from the centre of the inventory route to the nearest permanent source of running or standing water. Results In the Toiyabe Range, species richness decreases as elevation increases. Water availability and canyon depth and width vary predictably with elevation, but do not interact with elevation to affect species richness patterns. In the Toquima range, in contrast, species richness increases as elevation increases, and no other predictive variable covaries with elevation. Main conclusions We suggest that range-specific gradients in climatic severity contribute to the distinct elevational gradients in species richness.

In contrast, the lower portions of the river accumulate runoff from thunderstorms of the summer monsoon season. Thus, the waters of the Rio Grande are strongly influenced by regional climate and could be vulnerable to climate change. In order to study water resources in the Rio Grande Basin and how they may be affected by changes in regional climate, a modeling system, which relies on the use of coupled atmospheric, runoff, and ground water models, is being developed. Preliminary work on the project has focused on winter precipitation simulations of the upper Rio Grande Basin and evaluation of the suitability of the atmospheric model for simulating regional climate. This paper describes the spatial and temporal precipitation variability predicted by this model. To examine the temporal variability, results of simulations carried out with the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS), at 20 km resolution, are presented for the month of January 1996, representing a dry extreme far the region, and January 1993, representing a recent wet extreme. Results are also presented of a case study with higher resolution (5 km) over the upper Rio Grande Basin to examine spatial variability of the snowpack within complex terrain. The simulation results are compared to observations of daily-accumulated precipitation in the region. The comparisons of model predicted precipitation indicate that the RAMS model can reproduce the interannual changes in precipitation patterns found in the western US. In the month of January 1996, both RAMS and observed precipitation are highest in the northern mountain ranges of the domain. Likewise, in the month of January 1993, both predicted and observed precipitation in the southern tier of states are dramatically higher. Results of the simulations with increased model grid resolution indicate a modest improvement of precipitation estimates with the finer grid resolution over the Rio Grande Basin.

During the next interval of significant turnover, the late Tiffanian, higher-than-expected first occurrences resulted in an increase in standing richness and a change in faunal composition, most probably reflecting the immigration of taxa from outside North America. The third, and most dramatic, interval of significant generic turnover took place in the earliest Wasatchian and was distinguished by a high number of first occurrences, but relatively few last occurrences. This led to a marked increase in generic richness, a pattern similar to that for the early Wasatchian of North America as a whole. The major change in faunal composition, as in the late Tiffanian, was largely composed of immigrants from other continents. The pattern of faunal change during the early Wasatchian of the Bighorn Basin, along with evidence for global warming at the Paleocene-Eocene boundary, supports previous interpretations associating this episode in mammalian evolution with the opening of high latitude intercontinental dispersal routes. During the fourth interval of interest, the middle to late Wasatchian, the Bighorn Basin fossil record shows a drop in generic richness. This differs from the overall North American pattern, and may be, in part, an artifact of still inadequate sampling for the latest part of the stratigraphic sequence in the Bighorn Basin.",1995,10.1016/0031-0182(94)00111-K,Physical Geography; Geology; Paleontology,WOS:A1995RE44000008,Shana,No,Yes,Yes,Ecosystem/Municipal,Bighorn and Clark Forks Rivers,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Paris,,,No,"Big Horn, MT/WY",

This information is crucial, because the proposed high-level nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain will be located approximately 200-400 m above the modern water table. Water tables will rise in response to a future return to glacial climates, but the magnitude of the change-and the consequences for radionuclide travel times and overall repository integrity-are key uncertainties. Increased recharge during past pluvial periods in the Spring Mountains and Sheep Range caused water tables to rise and ground water to discharge over broad expanses of the Las Vegas Valley system, and in nearby Pahrump, Sandy, and Coyote Springs Valleys. In contrast, other valleys in the region contain only small areas of Pleistocene discharge resulting from local damming of ground water by faults that cut valley alluvium. In these instances, which include the Valley Wells area, and Piute and northern Coyote Springs Valleys, smaller ranges such as the Clark and New York Mountains supplied the moisture. The change in water-table levels since the last full glacial period varies between and within valleys, from as little as 10 m in several areas to 95 m in the Coyote Springs Valley. At Yucca Mountain, the water table has probably changed by less-than-or-equal-to 115 m in response to climate change. The spring deposits and the mollusk faunas found with them, often misinterpreted as lacustrine in origin, share many essential features with active spring systems in northeast Nevada. Deposits associated with discharge mainly consist of pale brown silt and sand that is entrapped by dense stands of phreatophytes covering valley bottoms when water tables are high. Pale green mud, containing a mix of aquatic, semiaquatic, and moist terrestrial mollusks, accumulates in wet meadows and marshes associated directly with spring discharge. The record in subbasins of the Las Vegas Valley system is dominated by late Wisconsin-age sediments, although pond sediments and alluvium belonging to at least one older (pre-Wisconsin?) pluvial period are also locally exposed. Deposits from two even earlier episodes of spring discharge, both of which also occurred during Rancholabrean time (10 to <450 ka), are exposed in the Pahrump, Chicago, Piute, and Coyote Springs Valleys, and in the Valley Wells. The records from the Pahrump and Coyote Springs Valleys are especially well exposed and likely extend back to at least early Pleistocene time.",1995,10.1130/0016-7606(1995)107<0213:FSDITS>2.3.CO;2,Geology,WOS:A1995QF59700007,Shana,No,,No,,Great Basin,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Paris,,,No,Yucca Mtn.

We use geologic and thermochronometric data to reconstruct the erosion history of southwestern North America. We infer that erosion events occurred mostly in response to surface uplift by contemporaneous tectonism, and were not long-delayed responses to surface uplift caused by later climate change or drainage reorganization. Rock uplift in response to isostatic compensation of exhumation occurred during each erosion event, but has been quantified only for parts of the late Miocene-Holocene erosion episode. We recognize four episodes of erosion and associated tectonic uplift: (1) the Laramide orogeny (ca. 75-45 Ma), during which individual uplifts were deeply eroded as a result of uplift by thrust faults, but Laramide basins and the Great Plains region remained near sea level, as shown by the lack of significant Laramide exhumation in these areas; (2) late middle Eocene erosion (ca. 42-37 Ma) in Wyoming, Montana, and Colorado, which probably occurred in response to epeirogenic uplift from lithospheric rebound that followed the cessation of Laramide dynamic subsidence; (3) late Oligocene-early Miocene deep erosion (ca. 27-15 Ma) in a broad region of the southern Cordillera (including the southern Colorado Plateau, southern Great Plains, trans-Pecos Texas, and northeastern Mexico), which was uplifted in response to increased mantle buoyancy associated with major concurrent volcanism in the Sierra Madre Occidental of Mexico and in the Southern Rocky Moun-tains; (4) Late Miocene-Holocene erosion (ca. 6-0 Ma) in a broad area of southwestern North America, with loci of deep erosion in the western Colorado-eastern Utah region and in the western Sierra Madre Occidental. Erosion in western Colorado-eastern Utah reflects mantle-related rock uplift as well as an important isostatic component caused by compensation of deep fluvial erosion in the upper Colorado River drainage following its integration to the Gulf of California. Erosion in the western Sierra Madre Occidental occurred in response to rift-shoulder uplift and the proximity of oceanic base level following the late Miocene opening of the Gulf of California. We cannot estimate the amount of rock or surface uplift associated with each erosion episode, but the maximum depths of exhumation for each were broadly similar (typically similar to 1-3 km). Only the most recent erosion episode is temporally correlated with climate change. Paleoaltimetric studies, except for those based on leaf physiognomy, are generally compatible with the uplift chronology we propose here. Physiognomy-based paleoelevation data suggest that near-modern elevations were attained during the Paleogene, but are the only data that uniquely support such interpretations. High Paleogene elevations require a complex late Paleogene-Neogene uplift and subsidence history for the Front Range and western Great Plains of Colorado that is not compatible with the regional sedimentation and erosion events we describe here. Our results suggest that near-modern surface elevations in southwestern North America were generally not attained until the Neogene, and that these high elevations are the cumulative result of four major episodes of Cenozoic rock uplift of diverse origin, geographic distribution, and timing.",2012,10.1130/GES00801.1,Geology,WOS:000312929900002,Becky,No,No,No,,"Mt/CO/WY, geologic time",NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Paris,Yes,No,Paleo,,

Of these samples, 51 were also analyzed for hydrogen isotope ratios. These smectites were formed as a result of the weathering of volcanic air-fall deposits that blanketed much of western North America during the Tertiary. Smectite-bearing ashfall samples were collected from Eocene, Oligocene, and Miocene deposits along a transect that extends from the western Great Plains to Yellowstone National Park at modern elevations from similar to 900 to similar to 2800 m. In general, oxygen and hydrogen delta values of smectite lie along a line parallel to the meteoric water line, which suggests that the isotopic composition of these ash-derived smectites records the meteoric water composition during its formation. There is little evidence for postdepositional exchange with basinal brine fluids, evaporative effects, or diagenesis of these smectites. The delta O-18 values of Oligocene and Miocene samples increase similar to 6% linearly from sample sites located at the crest of the Rocky Mountains to sites in western Nebraska and South Dakota. These results mimic the distribution and values of calculated oxygen isotope ratios of theoretical modern smectite over this same geographic traverse of decreasing elevation. This result suggests modern atmospheric circulation patterns and that the resulting distribution of delta O-18(precipitation) has persisted since the Oligocene. The delta O-18 values of Eocene samples increase similar to 8% between the Yellowstone region and central Wyoming, a result that does not correlate with modern delta O-18(precipitation) trends. Our Eocene results may be explained by climate conditions extant at that time, but tectonic modification in the region between 50 Ma and 37 Ma cannot be excluded as the cause of our results.

Paleofire reconstructions are commonly based on stratigraphic analysis of macroscopic charcoal in a single core from the central basin of a lake. We investigated the influence of core location on paleofire interpretations. Our approach was to: (1) examine the spatial distribution of recent charcoal deposition in a lake, (2) evaluate the effects of different subsample volumes on charcoal counts, and (3) explore the influence of sediment water content on charcoal concentration values. We retrieved short sediment cores from eight locations, including central, profundal and sublittoral depths, across a small montane lake located in southeastern British Columbia, Canada, to examine the effect of core location on macroscopic charcoal-based reconstructions of fire history. A long sediment core was also collected from the centre of the lake. The pattern of charcoal accumulation in the short cores was compared to the record collected from the lake's centre, which spans the Holocene. Each short core was stratigraphically matched with the long core using a discrete tephra marker to form a continuous record and examine the influence of core location on the interpretation of long-term fire regimes. We also examined how sample volume (1 vs. 5 cm(3)) from a single core affected macroscopic charcoal analysis and paleofire interpretation. Finally, we compared paleofire reconstructions generated from charcoal accumulation rates from wet sediment volume (CHAR) and dry sediment weight. Results were generally similar, but differed slightly in uppermost unconsolidated sediments. Even in small lakes with simple bathymetry, bulk sedimentation rates and charcoal accumulation rates may vary throughout the basin. The best record of past fires is preserved in sediment cores from the flattest and deepest area of the basin. These findings suggest that lake-bottom topography is an important consideration when targeting coring locations and interpreting charcoal data. Understanding how coring location, core sampling strategies and data processing affect paleofire inferences is important for generating robust quantitative paleoecological interpretations.",2015,10.1007/s10933-015-9838-2,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,WOS:000355218100004,Micah,No,No,No,,PNW,Shana,Maybe,Maybe,No,,"SE BC, paleoclimate--lake sediment",NA,,,,,Paris,Yes,Yes,Paleo,"SE BC, winter precip is snow",

This paper explores these regime shifts by building upon a hydroclimatic classification system that partitions the United States into clusters of similarly behaved catchments using four simple hydroclimatic indicators. Hydroclimate data from over four hundred catchments over a 55 year period (belonging to the MOPEX data set) are analyzed to reveal how the indicators have shifted before and after 1970, before and after 1975, and before and after 1980. Statistically significant hydroclimatic changes in these indicators are explored qualitatively, suggesting which catchments today might resemble other catchments tomorrow. Thus, a preview of current locations in one class under future conditions is provided by observing existing locations of another class. The classification system structure enables organization of these data, allowing patterns of regime change to emerge without highly specified models at each individual site. Regional analyses explore changes in mean seasonal precipitation/runoff regimes, including shifts in the daily variability of precipitation and runoff. Additionally, changes in regime curves of minimum and maximum precipitation/runoff observations are analyzed and discussed. Results indicate that after 1980, classifications typically found in the southeastern quarter of the United States have expanded northward and westward. Regionally, the Midwest and Rocky Mountains seem to demonstrate more frequent, but less intense storms after 1980, while southeastern catchments receive much less water in the form of precipitation and runoff than in previous years.

American pikas (Ochotona princeps) are typically limited to high elevations in western North America; however, they persist near sea level in the Columbia River Gorge, well outside their previously assumed climatic niche. We hypothesized that utilizing unusual food resources contributes to pika persistence in this unusual climate. Moss comprised more than 60% of the diet at 2 sites, more than observed for any mammalian herbivore in the wild. Moss is available year-round in this habitat; thus, by specializing on moss, pikas do not have to construct large food caches to survive winter.

Submesic whitebark pine stands developed a dense canopy dominated by T. mertensiana, and although their understories did not become compositionally similar to mesic ecosystems, there was minimal P. albicaulis regeneration.

We developed a decision support process for adapting salmon recovery plans that incorporates (1) local habitat factors limiting salmon recovery, (2) scenarios of climate change effects on stream flow and temperature, (3) the ability of restoration actions to ameliorate climate change effects, and (4) the ability of restoration actions to increase habitat diversity and salmon population resilience. To facilitate the use of this decision support framework, we mapped scenarios of future stream flow and temperature in the Pacific Northwest region and reviewed literature on habitat restoration actions to determine whether they ameliorate a climate change effect or increase life history diversity and salmon resilience. Under the climate change scenarios considered here, summer low flows decrease by 35-75% west of the Cascade Mountains, maximum monthly flows increase by 10-60% across most of the region, and stream temperatures increase between 2 and 6 degrees C by 2070-2099. On the basis of our literature review, we found that restoring floodplain connectivity, restoring stream flow regimes, and re-aggrading incised channels are most likely to ameliorate stream flow and temperature changes and increase habitat diversity and population resilience. By contrast, most restoration actions focused on in-stream rehabilitation are unlikely to ameliorate climate change effects. Finally, we illustrate how the decision support process can be used to evaluate whether climate change should alter the types or priority of restoration actions in a salmon habitat restoration plan.

A high-spatial-resolution multidimensional hydrodynamics model was used to assess the degree of scour risk in low-gradient unconfined gravel bed channels that are the favored environment for autumn-spawning salmon in mountain watersheds such as the Middle Fork Salmon River (MFSR), Idaho. In one of the most important MFSR spawning tributaries, near-bed shear stresses were relatively low at all discharges from base flows to 300% of bankfull. The highest stresses were found only in small areas of the central flow core and not at spawning sites. Median shear stresses did not increase in overbank flow conditions because poor channel confinement released the excess water into adjacent floodplains. Channel and floodplain topography, rather than discharge, control the maximum near-bed shear stresses. Over the modeled range of discharges, similar to 2% of the total surface area of the main stem channel bed was predicted to be mobile. Even in known spawning areas, where shear stresses are higher, 20% of the spawning surface area was mobile during overbank flows with a 2year recurrence interval. Field measurements of little gravel transport during flows that were 93% of bankfull support the numerical model predictions.

With rapid climate change expected in the coming decades, ecologists have predicted that species ranges will shift large distances in elevation and latitude. However, most range shift assessments are based on coarse-scale climate models that ignore fine-scale heterogeneity and could fail to capture important range shift dynamics. Moreover, if climate varies dramatically over short distances, some populations of certain species may only need to migrate tens of meters between microhabitats to track their climate as opposed to hundreds of meters upward or hundreds of kilometers poleward. To address these issues, we measured climate variables that are likely important determinants of plant species distributions and abundances (snow disappearance date and soil temperature) at coarse and fine scales at Mount Rainier National Park in Washington State, USA. Coarse-scale differences across the landscape such as large changes in elevation had expected effects on climatic variables, with later snow disappearance dates and lower temperatures at higher elevations. However, locations separated by small distances (similar to 20 m), but differing by vegetation structure or topographic position, often experienced differences in snow disappearance date and soil temperature as great as locations separated by large distances (>1 km). Tree canopy gaps and topographic depressions experienced later snow disappearance dates than corresponding locations under intact canopy and on ridges.

The context involves decisions about managing forest lands that have been severely affected by mountain pine beetles in British Columbia, a pest infestation that is climate-exacerbated. A forest management decision was developed as the basis for the context, objectives, and alternatives for land management actions, to frame and condition the judgments. A wide range of climate forecasts, taken to represent the 1090% levels on cumulative distributions for future climate, were developed to condition judgments. An elicitation instrument was developed, tested, and revised to serve as the basis for eliciting probabilistic three-point distributions regarding the performance of selected alternatives, over a set of relevant objectives, in the short and long term. The elicitations were conducted in a workshop comprising 14 regional forest management specialists. We employed the concept of stochastic dominance to help identify robust alternatives. We used extensive sensitivity analysis to explore the patterns in the judgments, and also considered the preferred alternatives for each individual expert. The results show that two alternatives that are more flexible than the current policies are judged more likely to perform better than the current alternatives on average in terms of stochastic dominance. The results suggest judgmental approaches to robust decision making deserve greater attention and testing.",2012,10.1111/j.1539-6924.2012.01822.x,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences",WOS:000312526500010,Becky,Yes,Yes,Yes,Global/International,"Pine Beetle, not really about CC, but changing temps may influence their habitat",NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Paris,Maybe,Yes,Yes,non-specific BC,

To assess the possibility that the declines have arisen from climate-related factors, several experiments were conducted to determine the upper thermal tolerances of embryos and fry and the effects of temperature on growth. Hatching of eggs was measured at 5.7, 6.4, 8.4, and 10.4 degrees C (three replicates each). Survival and growth of fry were measured for 33 d at 5.7, 8.2, 11.8, 16.5, 19.1, 22.2, and 25.2 degrees C (three replicates each). Mean hatching success was 96.7% (SD, 2.9) at 5.7 degrees C, 98.3% (2.9) at 6.4 degrees C, 90.0% (8.7) at 8.4 degrees C and 38.3% (10.4) at 10.4 degrees C. The ultimate upper incipient lethal temperature for fry was 23.6 degrees C (95% CI, 23.5-23.7 degrees C) after 7 d, which decreased with time to 22.6 degrees C (22.1-23.0 degrees C) after 33 d. The critical thermal maximum was 26.7 degrees C (SD, 0.8) for fry acclimated to 13.4 degrees C. The temperature for maximum growth was 13.8 degrees C (95% CI, 10.8-16.8 degrees C). Growth rates above and below the temperature for maximum growth decreased sharply to about 40% of the maximum at 5.7 degrees C and 22.2 degrees C. Based on these experimental data, the criteria for the protection of Mountain Whitefish fry are 21.6 degrees C for acute water temperature and 16.8 degrees C for chronic water temperature. The acute criterion for reproductionbased on the maximum temperature for successful incubationis 8.4 degrees C. The low upper thermal tolerance of Mountain Whitefish relative to those of other salmonids suggests that they will be very vulnerable to the increasing stream temperatures resulting from climate change.

The temperature signal within the chronologies is complex and strongly influenced by diverging trends in the summer temperature and ring-width records from across the region. A first differences transformation of the tree-ring and temperature records illustrates a loss of frequency coherence in growth response to summer temperatures following reduced radial growth in the 1950s. Prior to reduced growth, we note a positive association with summer temperatures for both first differenced (r(d) = 0.60) and traditional (r = 0.50) records. Following reduced growth, the association at first differences is maintained (r(d) = 0.49) whereas there is a change in the lower frequency component of tree growth response to summer temperatures (r = -0.34). We suggest the cause of this reduced temperature sensitivity is related to the interaction between diurnal temperature and cloud cover patterns, the hydrological regime of snowpack, and site conditions which have been amenable to the initiation of moisture stress during the latter half of the 20th century. Reduced radial growth is coincident with the arrival of white pine blister rust (Cronatium ribicola J.C. Fisch. ex Raben) into the study region which suggests this infestation may be related to the observed reduction in radial growth. Whitebark pine has considerable potential for the field of dendroclimatology. Unfortunately, the decline of the species due to the combined effects of climate change, white pine blister rust, mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopk.), and forest fire exclusion practices indicate this potential may remain unfulfilled.

Seven years (six winters) from 2000 to 2006 are simulated at 4 km resolution to assess the similarities and differences between the two models as well as the implications for hydrologic modeling. Inherent biases in both approaches are apparent, highlighting the difficulty in climate model validation. Results show general agreement between the two models in the spatial distribution of winter precipitation. A principal component analysis shows similar spatial patterns between models in the leading six components suggesting that the main processes that drive the spatial distribution of precipitation were properly captured. The first component explains almost 70% of total variance, and the first three components explain more than 85% in both data sets. The largest differences between the two data sets exist in areas at high elevation and upstream of the continental divide where observations are sparse. In these areas, WRF consistently predicts higher amounts of precipitation and larger interannual variability than PRISM. We suggest that these results are realistic for impingement of moist air masses on topography and, if correct, could have significant implications in flood forecasting, water resource management, and climate change studies.

This study analyzes mean August discharge at 153 streams throughout the Central Rocky Mountains of North America (CRMs) for changes in discharge from 1950-2008. The purpose of this study was to determine if: (1) Mean August stream discharge values have decreased over the last half-century; (2) Low discharge values are occurring more frequently; (3) Climatic variables are influencing August discharge trends. Here we use a strict selection process to characterize gauging stations based on amount of anthropogenic impact in order to identify heavily impacted rivers and understand the relationship between climatic variables and discharge trends. Using historic United States Geologic Survey discharge data, we analyzed data for trends of 40-59 years. Combining of these records along with aerial photos and water rights records we selected gauging stations based on the length and continuity of discharge records and categorized each based on the amount of diversion. Variables that could potentially influence discharge such as change in vegetation and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) were examined, but we found that that both did not significantly influence August discharge patterns. Our analyses indicate that non-regulated watersheds are experiencing substantial declines in stream discharge and we have found that 89% of all non-regulated stations exhibit a declining slope. Additionally our results here indicate a significant (alpha a parts per thousand currency signaEuro parts per thousand 0.10) decline in discharge from 1951-2008 for the CRMs. Correlations results at our pristine sites show a negative relationship between air temperatures and discharge and these results coupled with increasing air temperature trends pose serious concern for aquatic ecosystems in CRMs.",2012,10.1007/s10584-011-0235-1,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,WOS:000304105600023,Becky,Yes,Yes,Yes,Landscape/State-Province,,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Paris,Yes,Yes,Yes,Central Rockies,

Sound bioenergy policies must be informed by accurate estimates of potential feedstock production, rights to the production, social values and economics. Two of the main sources of bioenergy feedstock from forests are (i) harvesting residue and (ii) dead wood resulting from natural disturbances (i.e. standing dead timber). We modeled the production of bioenergy feedstock from these two sources from 2005 to 2020 for Canada's managed forest south of 60 degrees N so that this information can be used in provincial and national strategic planning. Published estimates of harvesting residue vary widely, and our objective was to provide more precise estimates based on new forest inventory data and regional modeling. Natural disturbances result in very large quantities of dead wood on the landscape, but estimates of future stocks and annual production have not previously been made. Our estimates included a 50% discount factor to net-down theoretically available quantities to a more realistic estimate of potential ecologically sustainable bioenergy feedstock The total future annual production averaged 51 +/- 17 Tg year(-1) from natural disturbances and 20 +/- 0.6 Tg year(-1) from clearcut harvesting residues. Harvesting residue for the area logged varied spatially from a low of 1.0 +/- 0.77 kg m(-2) year(-1) to a high of 6.7 +/- 0.1 kg m(-2) year(-1). Dead wood production due to insects was forecast to peak in the Montane Cordillera of British Columbia (BC) at 16.7 Tg year(-1) due to the current mountain pine beetle outbreak. Total dead wood production due to fire was highest in the western portion of the boreal forest (3.6 Tg year(-1) in the Boreal Shield of Saskatchewan), in part due to the high frequency of fires in these ecosystems and the large area of western boreal forest, but the highest density production was in BC: >9 kg m(-2) year(-1) in the burned area. Our results showed that the dead wood stocks of 331 Tg oven-dry matter potentially available for bioenergy in 2020 are much smaller than the 3100 +/- 84 Tg of dead wood stocks estimated based on ecosystem dynamics. While bioenergy use will accelerate the release of greenhouse gases compared to on-site decay, the energy is renewable and can be used as a substitute for fossil fuels. The net benefit to the atmosphere of forest bioenergy use is affected by many factors, and future research should further assess which sustainable wood-based bioenergy strategies yield the greatest net greenhouse gas benefits over the different time scales needed for post-disturbance forest recovery.

We regress observed area burned onto observed meteorological fields and fire indices from the Canadian Fire Weather Index system and find that May-October mean temperature and fuel moisture explain 24-57% of the variance in annual area burned in this region. Applying meteorological fields calculated by a general circulation model (GCM) to our regression model, we show that increases in temperature cause annual mean area burned in the western United States to increase by 54% by the 2050s relative to the present day. Changes in area burned are ecosystem dependent, with the forests of the Pacific Northwest and Rocky Mountains experiencing the greatest increases of 78 and 175%, respectively. Increased area burned results in near doubling of wildfire carbonaceous aerosol emissions by midcentury. Using a chemical transport model driven by meteorology from the same GCM, we calculate that climate change will increase summertime organic carbon (OC) aerosol concentrations over the western United States by 40% and elemental carbon (EC) concentrations by 20% from 2000 to 2050. Most of this increase (75% for OC and 95% for EC) is caused by larger wildfire emissions with the rest caused by changes in meteorology and for OC by increased monoterpene emissions in a warmer climate.

Additionally, elevated surface concentrations suggest that they are likely added throughout the year via dry deposition. In a 1-h stream sampling, ratios of dissolved (<0.45 mu m) V : Cl(-), Sr : Cl(-), and Cu : Cl(-) are enriched in the Eliot Stream with respect to their environmentally available trace element to Cl(-) ratios in Eliot Glacier snow, suggesting chemical weathering additions in the stream waters. Dissolved Ph : Cl(-) is depleted in the Eliot Stream with respect to the ratio of environmentally available Pb to Cl(-) in snow, corresponding to greater adsorption onto particles at greater pH values.

Geographical regions, latitude bands, and elevation classes where these trends are statistically significantly different from trends associated with natural climate variations are identified. Variables analyzed include late-winter and spring temperature, winter-total snowy days as a fraction of winter-total wet days, 1 April snow water equivalent (SWE) as a fraction of October-March (ONDJFM) precipitation total [precip(ONDJFM)], and seasonal [JFM] accumulated runoff as a fraction of water-year accumulated runoff. Observed changes were compared to natural internal climate variability simulated by an 850-yr control run of the finite volume version of the Community Climate System Model, version 3 (CCSM3-FV), statistically downscaled to a (1)/(8)degrees grid using the method of constructed analogs. Both observed and downscaled model temperature and precipitation data were then used to drive the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrological model to obtain the hydrological variables analyzed in this study. Large trends (magnitudes found less than 5% of the time in the long control run) are common in the observations and occupy a substantial part (37%-42%) of the mountainous western United States. These trends are strongly related to the large-scale warming that appears over 89% of the domain. The strongest changes in the hydrologic variables, unlikely to be associated with natural variability alone, have occurred at medium elevations [750-2500 m for JFM runoff fractions and 500-3000 m for SWE/Precip(ONDJFM)] where warming has pushed temperatures from slightly below to slightly above freezing.

In this paper, we develop a simple conceptual model that links the timing of peak snowmelt with geologically mediated differences in rate of streamflow recession. This model demonstrates that within the western United States, spatial differences in subsurface drainage rates can exacerbate summer streamflow losses associated with diminishing snowpacks. Application of a process-based hydrologic model to four watersheds in the Western Cordillera further reveals that contingent on timing of snowmelt, slower draining watersheds are likely to have more water in summer but paradoxically are subject to the greatest summer water losses under a 1.5 degrees C warming scenario. A slow draining watershed located in the young volcanic arc of the High Cascades in Oregon shows 4 times the summer streamflow reduction when compared with faster draining watersheds with similar timing of peak snowmelt. On the other hand, watersheds where snowmelt occurs late in the season but have little groundwater influence show high relative sensitivities to snowpack changes due to warming, as shown by a high-elevation granitic Sierran watershed.

Nothing comparable to this extant biome existed during the global ""greenhouse"" interval of the Late Mesozoic and Paleogene. Latitudinal temperature gradients should have confined boreal taxa to extremely high latitudes, but evergreen taxa do not appear to have been competitive in the lowlands of the high arctic, where the vegetation consisted of a unique circumpolar forest dominated by deciduous conifers and broad-leaved taxa. Probable sources for the pinaceous taxa that now characterize boreal latitudes were the Paleogene evergreen montane coniferous forests of the western North American Cordillera. Taphonomic factors limit the fossil record for such forests, but assemblages such as the Eocene Thunder Mountain (Idaho) and Bull Run (Nevada) floras were dominated by evergreen and deciduous Pinaceae that dominate extant montane, subalpine, and Boreal Forest associations. In response to post-Eocene global cooling, such forests presumably would have migrated to lower elevations, eventually spreading across high-latitude North America, subsequently reaching Eurasia via the Beringian corridor. This high-diversity coniferous forest was differentially winnowed and modified during subsequent migration southward in both the New and Old World. Despite its extensive geographic distribution, the Boreal Forest may be the youngest of the major forest biomes. If global warming ultimately results in a significant redistribution of terrestrial vegetation, the history of the Boreal Forest may well be reversed. Northward migration of the Boreal Forest may be characterized by loss of taxa and extensive community reorganization as individual taxa are pushed to their limits with respect to rates of migration and biotic stress takes its toll in the form of insect predation and disease. If evergreen taxa are unable to survive at low elevations at high polar latitudes, such conifers might once again become restricted to montane refugia and the lowlands of the high arctic would be populated by a larch-dominated deciduous conifer forest of low diversity and limited geographic extent. Given the biogeographic significance of the Boreal Forest biome, such a consequence would represent a profound ecological transformation. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The pollen data suggest little change in vegetation in the last 2 millennia, aside from a long-term trend toward more forest at the expense of steppe. One site showed an expansion of mesophytic taxa in the last 350 years as a result of local changes in hydrology, and another site was dry prior to AD 1000 and showed fluctuations in steppe composition thereafter. The longest record suggests that fire frequency was higher before AD 1200 than after.

Changes in the vegetation and fire history of the last 2000 years show a response to effectively drier conditions prior to AD 1200 and wetter conditions during the Little lee Age. Evidence of human influences was muted at best. Native Americans apparently did not alter the vegetation and fire regimes significantly during their occupation of jackson Hole.

Water samples were collected from the inflow and outflow of lakes with varying amounts of upstream lakes and forested area during spring runoff and summer base flow. During base flow, mean total nitrogen concentrations at the inflow of final lakes were significantly related to relative upstream lake area, increasing from 34 to 103 mu g N L-1 as upstream lake cover in the watersheds increased from 0% to 4%. Forest cover was not significantly correlated with total nitrogen concentrations exported from the watersheds.

At the scale of individual lakes, dissolved organic carbon and dissolved organic nitrogen increased, and nitrate was significantly reduced from inflows to outflows.

In particular, glaciers can only be responsible for peak uplift if they are capable of generating significant relief in formerly nonglaciated landscapes. Previous work has suggested that relief in glaciated landscapes should scale with the thickness of the ice. Here we summarise a field-based test of this hypothesis in two mountain ranges in the western United States, the Sierra Nevada, California, and the Sangre de Cristo Range, Colorado. These areas exhibit a range of degrees of glacial occupation during the Quaternary, including some drainage basins essentially unoccupied by ice, allowing a detailed exploration of how relief in different parts of a drainage basin evolves in response to glacial modification. We mapped last glacial maximum (LGM) trimlines to estimate the ice thickness at the equilibrium line altitude during the LGM, and determined several metrics of relief for drainage basins across the full spectrum of LGM ice extents. Comparison between measures of relief and ice thickness estimates indicates that relief production in glaciated mountain belts scales with ice thickness and consequently also drainage area. We extended our study to the Bitterroot Range in Idaho/Montana, and the Teton Range in Wyoming, for a more comprehensive understanding of sub-ridgeline relief, or 'missing mass'. This measure of rnean relief is surprisingly little affected by either the degree of glacial modification or the total material removed by glaciers, but appears to be influenced by the more active tectonics of the Teton Range. While the effects of glacial modification on the landscape are clear (valley widening, hanging valley formation), the overall change in the relief structure of the mountain ranges studied here is surprisingly modest.

Location: The forested region of the Pacific Northwest, United States and Canada. Methods: We first mapped monthly climatic data, averaged for the period 1950 to 1975 at 1 km resolution across the region. The recorded presence and absence of 15 native tree species were next mapped at 1 km resolution from data acquired on 22 771 field survey plots. To establish seasonal limits on photosynthesis and water use, a process-based growth model (3-PG, Physiological Processes to Predict Growth) was parameterized for Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), one of the most widely distributed species in the region. Automated decision tree analyses were used to predict the distribution of different species by creating a suite of rules associated with the relative constraints that soil drought, atmospheric humidity deficits, suboptimal and subfreezing temperatures would impose on the growth of Douglas-fir. Results: The 3-PG process-based modeling approach, combined with automated decision tree analyses, predicted presence and absence of 15 conifers on field survey plots with an average accuracy of 82 +/- 12%. Predictive models of current distribution for each species differed in the number of, order in, and physiological thresholds selected. A deficit in the soil water balance, followed by departures from optimum temperatures in the summer were the two most important variables selected in predicting species distributions. Conclusions: Although empirical models using different sampling techniques and statistical analyses may be more accurate in predicting current distribution of species, the hybrid approach presented in this paper provides a greater mechanistic understanding of the limits to growth and tree distributions.

The magnitude of current white pine blister rust (WPBR) infection caused by the pathogen Cronartium ribicola and mountain pine beetle (MPB; Dendroctonus ponderosae) impacts, combined with the effect of climate change on beetle population dynamics, are placing this foundation species in a precarious state. We collected stand- and tree-level data in three whitebark pine systems in the southern Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem to evaluate current conditions and to determine how characteristics of individual whitebark pine trees, including the presence and severity of white pine blister rust, influence host selection by the MPB. Data revealed that 45% of all whitebark pine trees sampled were dead. In addition, 67% of all trees sampled were attacked by MPB, 83% were infected with WPBR, and 62% were affected by both. Whitebark pine trees that were selected as hosts by MPB exhibited significantly greater blister rust severity than trees that were not selected. Multiple logistic regression analyses identified a complex set of tree characteristics related to host selection by MPB; in addition to rust severity, stand type (mixed species or pure whitebark pine) and tree diameter were also significant predictors of selection. The interaction among MPB selection patterns, blister rust severity, tree diameter, and stand type quantified in this study will likely continue to influence the disturbance pattern and severity in whitebark pine ecosystems in the Greater Yellowstone Area.

A relation between rock slope instabilities in cold high mountain areas and climate change is currently becoming more evident and questions about possible consequences and hazard scenarios in densely populated high mountain regions leading beyond historical precedence are rising. To improve hazard assessment of potential rock-ice avalanches, their mobility is a critical factor. This contribution is an attempt to unravel driving factors for the mobility of large rock-ice avalanches by synthesizing results from physical laboratory experiments and empirical data from 64 rock-ice avalanches with volumes > 1x10(6) m(3) from glacierized high mountain regions around the world. The influence of avalanche volume, water and ice content, low-friction surfaces, and topography on the apparent coefficient of friction (as a measure of mobility) is assessed. In laboratory experiments granular ice in the moving mass was found to reduce bulk friction up to 20% while water led to a reduction around 50% for completely saturated material compared with dry flows. Evidence for the effects of water as a key driving factor to enhance mobility was also found in the empirical data, while the influence of the ice content could not be confirmed to be of much relevance in nature. Besides liquefaction, it was confirmed that mobility increases with volumes and that frictional surface characteristics such as flow paths over glaciers are also dominant variables determining mass movement mobility. Effects of the topography along the flow path as well as channeling are assumed to be other critical factors. The results provide an empirical basis to roughly account for different path and flow characteristics of large rock-ice avalanches and to find appropriate ranges for friction parameters for scenario modeling and hazard assessments.

The use of treeline as a proxy for climate change has been assessed in parks throughout the west but often at the expense of geology or geomorphology as controls of treeline variation. The dissimilar geology and geomorphic processes of the western national parks suggest that treeline may respond differently between national parks when subjected to disturbance. Therefore, predicted vegetation response to disturbance across the western USA may provide a limited assessment of change beyond fine-scale analysis due to data collection from a limited number of national parks containing alpine treeline. We performed a content analysis on previous research that examined alpine treeline in national parks and classified each treeline study as anthropogenic, orographic/edaphic, or climatic according to the primary factor attributed to treeline control. Results indicated that the three types of treeline are not uniformly studied. Climatic treeline is most commonly studied whereas anthropogenic and orographic/edaphic studies are often lacking. Furthermore, several western national parks are entirely devoid of anthropogenic and orographic treeline research. Similar findings exist for treeline studies in protected places worldwide.

Individual populations evolved distinct life history characteristics in response to the diverse environments in which they were isolated after the last glaciation. Anthropogenic activities have resulted in a substantial decline (42% of the historical range is currently occupied; 28% is occupied by core [genetically unaltered] populations), but the number of extant populations, especially in headwater streams, has precluded listing of this taxon under the Endangered Species Act. Primary threats to persistence of Yellowstone cutthroat trout include (1) invasive species, resulting in hybridization, predation, disease, and interspecific competition; (2) habitat degradation from human activities such as agricultural practices, water diversions, grazing, dam construction, mineral extraction, grazing, timber harvest, and road construction; and (3) climate change, including an escalating risk of drought, wildfire, winter flooding, and rising temperatures. Extirpation of individual populations or assemblages has led to increasing isolation and fragmentation of remaining groups, which in turn raises susceptibility to the demographic influences of disturbance (both human and stochastic) and genetic factors. Primary conservation strategies include (1) preventing risks associated with invasive species by isolating populations of Yellowstone cutthroat trout and (2) connecting occupied habitats (where possible) to preserve metapopulation function and the expression of multiple life histories. Because persistence of isolated populations may be greater in the short term, current management is focused on isolating individual populations and restoring habitats; however, this approach implies that humans will act as dispersal agents if a population is extirpated because of stochastic events.",2011,10.1080/02755947.2011.608980,Fisheries,WOS:000296983500002,Danny,Yes,No,No,Ecosystem/Municipal,Upper Snake!,Danny,Yes,Yes,Yes,Ecosystem/Municipal,Snake Drainage,NA,,,,,Paris,Yes,Yes,Yes,Upper Snake!,

Climate change could substantially alter species abundance and composition, but the relative weight of the legacy of historical factors and projected future conditions in informing management objectives remains unresolved. We integrated land use histories with broad scale climatic factors to better understand how inland Pacific Northwest ecosystems may develop under projected climates. We measured vegetation structure and age distributions in five vegetation types (shrub steppe to subalpine forest) along an elevation gradient in the eastern Cascades of Washington. We quantitatively assessed compositional changes, and qualitatively summarized the environmental history (climate, fire and fire suppression, grazing, and logging) of each site. Little change was evident in woody species composition at the shrub steppe site. At the shrub steppe/forest ecotone, densities of drought-tolerant Artemisia tripartita and Pinus ponderosa increased. In the dry conifer, montane, and subalpine forest sites, increases in Pseudotsuga menziesii, Abies grandis, and Abies lasiocarpa, respectively, and decreases in Pinus ponderosa, Larix occidentalis, and Pinus contorta, respectively, have shifted species composition from fire and drought-tolerant species to shade-tolerant species. Fire suppression, grazing, and logging explain changes in species composition more clearly than climate variation does, although the relative influence of these factors varies with elevation. Furthermore, some of the observed changes in composition are opposite what we expect would be most suited to projected future climates. Natural resource managers need to recognize that the current state of an ecosystem reflects historical land uses, and that contemporary management actions can have long-term effects on ecosystem structure. Understanding the processes that generated an ecosystem's current structure will lead to more informed management decisions to effectively respond to projected climate changes. (C) 2010 Elsevier By.

The results show that trends in ET in spring and summer are determined primarily by trends in precipitation and snowmelt that determine water availability. From April to June, ET trends are mostly positive due primarily to earlier snowmelt and earlier emergence of snow-free ground, and secondarily to increasing trends in spring precipitation. From July to September trends in ET are more strongly influenced by precipitation trends, with the exception of areas ( most notably California) that receive little summer precipitation and have experienced large changes in snowmelt timing. Trends in the seasonal timing of ET are modest, but during the period 1947 - 2003 when temperature trends are large, they reflect a shift of ET from midsummer to early summer and late spring. As in other studies, it is found that runoff is occurring earlier in spring, a trend that is related primarily to increasing temperature, and is most apparent during 1947 - 2003. Trends in the annual runoff ratio, a variable critical to western water management, are determined primarily by trends in cool season precipitation, rather than changes in the timing of runoff or ET. It was found that the signature of temperature- related trends in runoff and SM is strongly keyed to mean midwinter [ December - February ( DJF)] temperatures. Areas with warmer winter temperatures show increasing trends in the runoff fraction as early as February, and colder areas as late as June.

Outbreaks of mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) require life cycles of one year with synchronous emergence of adults from host trees at an appropriate time of year (termed ""adaptive seasonality'') to overwhelm tree defenses. The annual course of temperature plays a major role in governing life stage development and imposing synchrony on mountain pine beetle populations. Here we apply a process-based model of adaptive seasonality across the western United States using gridded daily temperatures from the Vegetation/Ecosystem Modeling and Analysis Project (VEMAP) over the period 1895-2100. Historical locations of modeled adaptive seasonality overlay much of the distribution of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Douglas), a favored host, indicating that suitable temperatures for outbreak occurred in areas of host availability. A range of suitable temperatures, both in the mean and over an annual cycle, resulted in adaptive seasonality. Adaptive seasonality typically occurred when mean annual temperatures were 3 degrees-6 degrees C, but also included locations where mean temperatures were as low as 1 degrees C or as high as 11 degrees C, primarily as a result of variability in winter temperatures. For most locations, years of adaptive seasonality were uncommon during 1895-1993. We analyzed historical temperatures and adaptive seasonality in more detail in three northern forest ecoprovinces. In the Northern and Middle Rockies, areas of adaptive seasonality decreased at lower elevations and increased at higher elevations during warmer periods, resulting in a movement upward in elevation of adaptive seasonality. In contrast, the Cascade Mountains exhibited overall declines in adaptive seasonality with higher temperatures regardless of elevation. Projections of future warming (5 degrees C in the western United States) resulted in substantial reductions in the overall area of adaptive seasonality. At the highest elevations, predicted warmer conditions will result in increases in the area of adaptive seasonality. Our findings suggest that future climate change may alter forest ecosystems indirectly through alteration of these important disturbances.",2006,10.1029/2005JG000101,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology,WOS:000240991400001,Meghan,Yes,Yes,Yes,Landscape/State-Province,Pine beetle in western US,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Paris,Yes,Yes,Yes,cascades,

Importantly, striking changes in diatom communities (e.g., during the mid-Holocene (approx. 5500 to approx. 3500 cal. years BP) and Medieval Warm Period (approx. AD 800 to approx. AD 1250)) occurred without evidence of vegetation shifts. During these times, diverse periphytic diatoms dominated suggesting improved benthic habitat availability with longer growing seasons and probably reduced alkalinity and turbidity with warmer- and wetter-than-present climates. Diatom analysis from this alpine lake provides a sensitive record of climate-related limnological responses, but also refines our previous understanding of Holocene climate changes in the northern Rocky Mountains inferred from terrestrial-based paleoecological records.",2005,10.1139/B05-045,Plant Sciences,WOS:000232856200003,Meghan,No,Yes,No,,,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Paris,Yes,Yes,Yes,,

The area contains numerous national parks and protected areas with relatively pristine watersheds that permit analyses of historic streamflow patterns with minimal human impacts that would alter hydraulic linkages between precipitation and river discharge. Consequently, we analyzed patterns of mean annual discharge (Q(a)) from 31 river reaches that were generally free-flowing with hydrologic records typically commencing in the 1910s and extending to about 2002. To maximize the records of six rivers we undertook regression analyses to extrapolate Q(a) from sequential hydrometric gauges or from early, summer-only Q data. Spearman rho and Kendall tau b non-parametric correlations and a parametric approach involving linear regressions combined with analyses of variance were highly consistent in detecting significant historic trends in Q(a) and the regression analyses estimated the trend magnitudes. These analyses revealed flow declines (exceeding 0.1%/year over the historic record) for 21 reaches (5 with p<0.1, 10 with p<0.05), while 10 rivers displayed little change (<0.1%/year and not significant). Flow declines were prominent for the Alberta rivers, which flow to Hudson Bay and the Arctic Ocean, and also observed for some Pacific and Atlantic drainages. Overall, the rivers displayed a mean Q(a) reduction of 0.22%/year (median = -0.17%/year) and four rivers had recent decline rates exceeding 0.5%/year. The progressive decline was superimposed on an approximately half-century oscillation in streamflow that was strongly associated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. Following from the observed river flow decline over the past century, it is likely that there will be continuing decline in future decades; this prediction contrasts with many current climate change forecasts. Historic and continuing reductions in these streamflows will impact aquatic and riparian ecosystems and diminish water supplies for irrigation. industrial and domestic use, and hydroelectric power generation, with effects extending from these mountain headwaters downstream through other ecoregions.

There are many mechanisms for synchronizing developmental milestones, such as egg laying (oviposition), egg hatching, cocoon opening, and the emergence of adults. These are often irreversible, specific to particular life stages, and include diapause, an altered physiological state which can be reversed by some synchronizing environmental cue (e.g. photoperiod). However, many successful organisms display none of these mechanisms for maintaining adaptive seasonality. In this paper, we briefly review the mathematical relationship between environmental temperatures and developmental timing and discuss the consequences of viewing these models as circle maps from the cycle of yearly oviposition dates and temperatures to oviposition dates for subsequent generations. Of particular interest biologically are life cycles which are timed to complete in exactly 1 year, or univoltine cycles. Univoltinism, associated with reproductive success for many temperate species, is related to stable fixed points of the developmental circle map. Univoltine fixed points are stable and robust in broad temperature bands, but lose stability suddenly to maladaptive cycles at the edges of these bands. Adaptive seasonality may therefore break down with little warning with constantly increasing or decreasing temperature change, as in scenarios for global warming. These ideas are illustrated and explored in the context of Mountain Pine Beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) occurring in the marginal thermal habitat of central Idaho's Rocky Mountains. Applications of these techniques have not been widely explored by the applied math community, but are likely to provide great insight into the response of biological systems to climate change.

Streamflow timing changes for the 1995 - 2099 period are projected using regression relations between observed streamflow-timing responses in each river, measured by the temporal centroid of streamflow (CT) each year, and local temperature (TI) and precipitation ( PI) indices. Under 21st century warming trends predicted by the Parallel Climate Model (PCM) under business-as-usual greenhouse-gas emissions, streamflow timing trends across much of western North America suggest even earlier springtime snowmelt than observed to date. Projected CT changes are consistent with observed rates and directions of change during the past five decades, and are strongest in the Pacific Northwest, Sierra Nevada, and Rocky Mountains, where many rivers eventually run 30 - 40 days earlier.

Persistent changes in the rate of chronic or background mortality can dramatically alter the structure and composition of forests stands. Tree recruitment is the complement to tree mortality, combining with mortality to determine changes in tree density and species composition. The purpose of this study is to ascertain trends of mortality and recruitment in mature and old-growth forests in western Washington state, U.S.A. We used a set of permanent plots established in units of the National Park System spanning the environmental gradient of forests in these parks (from near sea-level to 1800 m elevation). Duration of observation was five years for most plots and two or three years for a small number of plots. Principal tree species on the plots were Picea sitchensis, Tsuga heterophylla, Pseudotsuga menziesii, Thuja plicata, Abies lasiocarpa, and Abies amabilis. Tree mortality was evaluated annually; recruitment was recorded at the end of the study. For small (dbh 12.7-76.1 cm) and large (dbh >76.1 cm) trees, annual mortality pooled across all elevations, parks, plots, and years was <1% (mean and upper 95% confidence intervals). For saplings (dbh 2.5-12.6 cm), mean mortality was <1% though the upper limit of the confidence interval was slightly greater than 1%. Recruitment outweighed mortality (and growth into the small-tree class) for saplings. Recruitment and losses of stems balanced one another for small trees; both processes were negligible for large trees. Recruitment of saplings increased representation of shade-tolerant species (e.g., T. heterophylla, and A. amabilis). Biotic factors predominated as the proximate cause of death for all size-classes of trees (i.e., trees died standing), though particular agents of mortality were not identified in most cases. Our results contrasted with a recent report of annual tree mortality >1% for unmanipulated, old-growth forests in the Pacific Northwest.

For example, range shifts may be slow if seed availability is low at range edges due to low parent-tree abundance or reduced fecundity. Even when seeds are available, climatic and biotic factors may further limit the availability of suitable microsites for recruitment. Unfortunately, the importance of seed and microsite limitation during range shifts remains unknown, since few studies have examined both factors simultaneously, particularly across species' ranges. To address this issue, we assessed seed availability and the factors influencing germination for six conifer species across a large environmental gradient encompassing their elevational ranges. Specifically, we assessed (1) how parent-tree abundance influences annual seed availability; (2) how seed limitation varies across species' ranges; (3) how climatic and biotic factors affect germination; and (4) how seed and suitable microsite availability covary annually within and among species. We found that seed availability declined toward species' upper range edges for most species, primarily due to low parent-tree abundance rather than declining fecundity. Range expansions are thus likely to be lagged with respect to climate change, as long generation times preclude rapid increases in tree density. Negative impacts of canopy cover on germination rates suggest range shifts will further be slowed by competition with existing vegetation. Moreover, years of high seed production were generally correlated among species, but not correlated with the availability of suitable microsites, implying that seedling competition and the interaction between seed and microsite limitation will further constrain recruitment. However, the nature of microsite limitation varied strongly between treeline and low-elevation species due to differing responses to snowpack duration and competition, suggesting that treeline species may be quicker to shift their ranges in response to warming than low-elevation species. In all, our results demonstrate that seed and microsite limitation will likely result in lagged responses to climate change but with differences among species leading to complex range shift dynamics.",2015,10.1890/14-0595.1,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WOS:000354119300013,Micah,No,Yes,No,,Mt Ranier,Becky,Yes,Yes,Yes,plot/family/group,Mt Ranier,NA,,,,,Paris,Yes,Yes,Yes,"Mt.

Large differences in microclimate occur with small changes in elevation, and this complex interaction is an important determinant of mountain plant distributions. In spite of this, elevation is not often considered as a relevant predictor in species distribution models (SDMs) for mountain plants. Here, we evaluated the importance of including elevation as a predictor in SDMs for mountain plant species. We generated two sets of SDMs for each of 73 plant species that occur in the Pacific Northwest of North America; one set of models included elevation as a predictor variable and the other set did not. AUC scores indicated that omitting elevation as a predictor resulted in a negligible reduction of model performance. However, further analysis revealed that the omission of elevation resulted in large over-predictions of species' niche breadths this effect was most pronounced for species that occupy the highest elevations. In addition, the inclusion of elevation as a predictor constrained the effects of other predictors that superficially affected the outcome of the models generated without elevation. Our results demonstrate that the inclusion of elevation as a predictor variable improves the quality of SDMs for high-elevation plant species. Because of the negligible AUC score penalty for over-predicting niche breadth, our results support the notion that AUC scores alone should not be used as a measure of model quality. More generally, our results illustrate the importance of selecting biologically relevant predictor variables when constructing SDMs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Declines in annual SFE and number of snowfall days were projected for all stations. Changes in the magnitude of snowfall event quantiles were sensitive to historical winter temperature. At climatologically cooler locations, such as in the Rocky Mountains, changes in the magnitude of snowfall events mirrored changes in the distribution of precipitation events, with increases in extremes and less change in more moderate events. By contrast, declines in snowfall event magnitudes were found for all quantiles in warmer locations. Common to both warmer and colder sites was a relative increase in the magnitude of snowfall extremes compared to annual SFE and a larger fraction of annual SFE from snowfall extremes. The coefficient of variation of annual SFE increased up to 80% in warmer montane regions due to projected declines in snowfall days and the increased contribution of snowfall extremes to annual SFE.

This species occupies an extremely wide ecological niche ranging from the semi-arid basins to the subalpine. Within this large niche, three widespread subspecies are recognized. Montane ecoregions are occupied by subspecies vaseyana, while subspecies wyomingensis and tridentata occupy basin ecoregions. In cases of wide-ranging species with multiple subspecies, it can be more practical from the scientific and management perspective to assess the climate profiles at the subspecies level. We focus bioclimatic model efforts on subspecies wyomingensis, which is the most widespread and abundant of the subspecies and critical habitat to wildlife including sage-grouse and pygmy rabbits. Using absence points from species with allopatric ranges to Wyoming big sagebrush (i.e.. targeted groups absences) and randomly sampled points from specific ecoregions, we modeled the climatic envelope for subspecies wyomingensis using Random Forests multiple-regression tree for contemporary and future climates (decade 2050). Overall model error was low, at 4.5%, with the vast majority accounted for by errors in commission (>99.9%). Comparison of the contemporary and decade 2050 models shows a predicted 39% loss of suitable climate. Much of this loss will occur in the Great Basin where impacts from increasing tire frequency and encroaching weeds have been eroding the A. tridentata landscape dominance and ecological functions. Our goal of the A. tridentata subsp. wyomingensis bioclimatic model is to provide a management tool to promote successful restoration by predicting the geographic areas where climate is suitable for this subspecies.

The global studies lack the specificity to inform decision making, while the local studies do little to clarify potential changes over large regions (major river basins, states, or groups of states), a scale often important in the development of water policy. An analysis of the potential impact of climate change on groundwater recharge across the western United States (west of 100 longitude) is presented synthesizing existing studies and applying current knowledge of recharge processes and amounts. Eight representative aquifers located across the region were evaluated. For each aquifer published recharge budget components were converted into four standard recharge mechanisms: diffuse, focused, irrigation, and mountain-systems recharge. Future changes in individual recharge mechanisms and total recharge were then estimated for each aquifer. Model-based studies of projected climate-change effects on recharge were available and utilized for half of the aquifers. For the remainder, forecasted changes in temperature and precipitation were logically propagated through each recharge mechanism producing qualitative estimates of direction of changes in recharge only (not magnitude). Several key patterns emerge from the analysis. First, the available estimates indicate average declines of 10-20% in total recharge across the southern aquifers, but with a wide range of uncertainty that includes no change. Second, the northern set of aquifers will likely incur little change to slight increases in total recharge. Third, mountain system recharge is expected to decline across much of the region due to decreased snow pack, with that impact lessening with higher elevation and latitude. Factors contributing the greatest uncertainty in the estimates include: (1) limited studies quantitatively coupling climate projections to recharge estimation methods using detailed, process-based numerical models; (2) a generally poor understanding of hydrologic flowpaths and processes in mountain systems; (3) difficulty predicting the response of focused recharge to potential changes in the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events; and (4) unconstrained feedbacks between climate, irrigation practices, and recharge in highly developed aquifer systems.

These forests include novel populations of the principal host species, lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), the novel species jack pine (Pinus banksiana), and their hybrids (P. contorta x P. banksiana). These novel forests are chemically and physically different than native forests, and recent studies have shown beetle reproductive performance is enhanced in these novel habitats. We conducted a field experiment to determine the effect of differing host chemistry, specifically alpha-pinene content, on secondary attraction by foraging mountain pine beetles. Alpha-pinene is the precursor molecule for the production of trans-verbenol, the main aggregation pheromone for this beetle species. We found that elevated relative concentrations of a-pinene in bolts significantly increased their attractiveness to in situ mountain pine beetles. Seventy-five percent of attacks were found on infested bolts with the most a-pinene relative to other monoterpenes. Other measures of terpene chemistry between bolt types could not explain the pattern of attacks. This result suggests that elevated concentrations of a-pinene could increase the rate of aggregation and attack success by the mountain pine beetle in novel pine forests. Newly invaded hybrid and jack pine in the western boreal forest are reported to contain 3-4 times the relative concentration of a-pinene than lodgepole pines in forests in which the beetle has coevolved. These elevated concentrations may help the mountain pine beetle overcome some of the potential restraints for establishment and spread in the boreal forest, such as low pine volume and connectivity, and continue expanding its range.

The avalanche data were observed along the section of the Trans Canada Highway within the park. Meteorological data were analyzed by winter season, i.e. early, mid and late winter, represented by three-month periods between September and May. Increasing trend's were found for the mean seasonal air temperature at both stations during the mid season. Trends for the solid precipitation rate were not significant, indicating no trend towards more rain events. Decreasing trends of the maximum snow depth were only found for the lower elevation station at Rogers Pass for the mid and late season, which is consistent with decreasing trends for all seasons of the mean 24-hour new snow amounts at the lower elevation and for the mid season at the higher elevation station at Mt.

Method sWe used 160,589 occurrence records for 1541 species of seed plants in Alberta (nearly 90% of the province's seed flora) and ensemble niche models to project current and future suitable habitats. We then examined climate change vulnerability of individual species and the potential impacts of climate change on species richness, PD and both taxonomic and phylogenetic endemism (PE). We also assessed whether predicted losses of PD were distributed randomly across the plant tree of life. Results We found that 368 species (24%) may lose on average >80% of their current suitable climates (habitats), while 539 species (35%) were projected to more than double their current suitable range.

Beginning about 1200 cal yr B.P., the fauna becomes more representative of xeric conditions with maxima in xeric-indicator taxa and minima in mesic-indicator taxa, concordant with the Medieval Warm Period (circa 1000 Co 650 yr B.P.). Cooler, wetter conditions which prevailed for most of the Little Ice Age (700 to 100 yr B.P.) in general correspond to a return to a more mesic mammalian fauna. A warm period within the Little Ice Age is documented by a xeric fauna. These data show that mammalian ecological sensitivity to climatic change over this intermediate time scale holds promise for predictions about the impacts of future global Warming.

Mountain meadows are areas of intensive fertilization and irrigation which may impact regional CH4 and N2O fluxes. Nitrogen fertilization typically increases yields, but N-use efficiency is generally low. Neither the amount of fertilizer-N recovered by the forage nor the effect on N2O and CH4 emissions were known. These trace gases are long-lived in the atmosphere and contribute to global warming potential and stratospheric ozone depletion. From 1991 through 1993 studies were conducted to determine the effect of N source, and timing of N-fertilization on forage yield, N-uptake, and trace gas fluxes at the CSU Beef Improvement Center near Saratoga, Wyoming. Plots were fertilized with 168 kg N ha(-1). Microplots labeled with N-15-fertilizer were established to trace the fate of the added N. Weekly fluxes of N2O and CH4 were measured during the snow-free periods of the year. Although CH4 was consumed when soils were drying, flood irrigation converted the meadow into a net source of CH4. Nitrogen fertilization did not affect CH4 flux but increased N2O emissions. About 5% of the applied N was lost as N2O from spring applied NH4NO3, far greater than the amount lost as N2O from urea or fall applied NH4NO3. Fertilizer N additions increased forage biomass to a maximum of 14.6 Mg ha(-1) with spring applied NH4NO3. Plant uptake of N-fertilizer was greater with spring applications (42%), than with fall applications (22%).",1996,10.1007/BF00704312,Agriculture,WOS:A1996WH50700005,Shana,Maybe,Yes,Maybe,,Mtn Meadows WY-Generally,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Paris,,,Yes,cant get full text,

This paper reports on the probable effects of a temperature increase and changes in transpiration on basin discharge in two different mountain snowmelt regions of the western United States. The hydrological effects of the climate changes are modeled with a relatively simple conceptual, semi-distributed snowmelt runoff model. Based on the model results, it may be concluded that increased air temperatures will result in a shift of snowmelt runoff to earlier in the snowmelt season. Furthermore, it is shown that it is very important to include the expected change in climate-related basin conditions resulting from the modeled temperature increase in the runoff simulation. The effect of adapting the model parameters to reflect the changed basin conditions resulted in a further shift of streamflow to April and an even more significant decrease of snowmelt runoff in June and July. If the air temperatures increase by approximately 5-degrees-C and precipitation and accumulated snow amounts remain about the same, runoff in April and May, averaged for the two basins, is expected to increase by 185 percent and 25 percent, respectively. The runoff in June and July will decrease by about 60 percent each month. Overall, the total seasonal runoff decreases by about 6 percent. If increased CO2 concentrations further change basin conditions by reducing transpiration by the maximum amounts reported in the literature, then, combined with the 5-degrees-C temperature increase, the April, May, June, and July changes would average +230 percent, +40 percent, -55 percent, and -45 percent, respectively.

Generally, there is some consistency among computer models of global climate that surface temperatures will increase and that, in many areas, precipitation and evaporation also may increase. However, determining the effects of such changes on the distribution and circulation of water at the land surface, and on water management systems, remains problematic. The American River, Washington, a mountainous tributary of the Yakima River, is typical of rivers in the Columbia Basin states of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and western Montana, as well as southern British Columbia. Using the American River as a case study, this investigation developed computer models to simulate and identify water management conflicts that might arise in this region under a general climate warming of both 2-degrees-C and 4-degrees-C. For warmer climates, it was found that snow accumulation would be substantially reduced, and the river's high flow season would shift from the spring to the winter. Potential evaporation would increase throughout the year (mostly in the summer), but peak actual evaporation would shift to the late spring and early summer, due to reduced summer soil moisture. The effect of the streamflow pattern that would accompany a warmer climate was tested on small and moderate sized hypothetical multi-purpose reservoirs. The results showed that water supply reliability would be significantly degraded by the earlier spring runoff pattern that would accompany a warmer climate, especially for small reservoirs. The result was that hydroelectric revenues might increase due to larger reservoir releases needed during the winter peak demand season. An investigation of alternative operating policies for the reservoir system showed that more efficient reservoir operation alone would not mitigate the degraded reliability of water supply that would accompany a warmer climate.",1992,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,WOS:A1992KM46100002,Shana,Yes,Yes,Yes,Biome/National,Cool early article modeling climate change in Columbia Basin,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Paris,,,Yes,"USGS pub, can't get full text",

Precipitation anomalies during ENSO often show opposite and spatially coherent dry and wet patterns in the Northwest and California or vice versa. The role of orography in establishing mesoscale ENSO anomalies in the western United States is examined based on observed precipitation and temperature data at 1/8degrees spatial resolution and a regional climate simulation at 40-km spatial resolution. Results show that during El Nino or La Nina winters, strong precipitation anomalies are found in northern California, along the southern California coast, and in the northwest mountains such as the Olympic Mountains, the Cascades, and the northern Rockies. These spatial features, which are strongly affected by topography, are surprisingly well reproduced by the regional climate simulation. A spatial feature investigated further is the positive - negative - positive precipitation anomaly found during El Nino years in the Olympic Mountains, and on the west side and east side of the Cascades in both observations and regional simulation. Observed streamflows of river basins located in those areas are found to be consistent with the precipitation anomalies. The spatial distribution of the precipitation anomalies is investigated by relating flow direction and moisture to the orientation of mountains and orographic precipitation. On the west side of the north - south-oriented Cascade Range, the increase in atmospheric moisture is not enough to compensate for the loss of orographic precipitation associated with a change in flow direction toward the southwest during El Nino years. In California, both the increase in atmospheric moisture and shift in wind direction toward the southwest enhance precipitation along the Sierra, which is oriented northwest to southeast. The spatial signature of the interactions between large-scale circulation and topography may provide useful information for seasonal predictions or climate change detection.",2003,10.1175/1520-0442(2003)016<1912:HOTWUS>2.0.CO;2,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,WOS:000183460100003,Shana,Yes,Yes,Yes,Biome/National,western US,NA,,,,,,Danny,Yes,Yes,Yes,West Wide,Paris,Yes,Yes,Yes,western US,

In order to allow for a detailed comparison of the estimated precipitation with observations, the simulated precipitation is taken from the NCEP-NCAR reanalysis, which nearly perfectly represents the historic pressure, temperature, and humidity, but calculates precipitation according to the model physics and parameterizations. Three statistical downscaling methods are investigated: (i) local rescaling of the simulated precipitation, and two newly developed methods, namely, (ii) downscaling using singular value decomposition (SVD) with simulated precipitation as the predictor, and (iii) local rescaling with a dynamical correction. Both local scaling methods are straightforward to apply to GCMs that are used for climate change experiments and seasonal forecasts, since they only need control runs for model fitting. The SVD method requires for model fitting special reanalysis-type GCM runs nudged toward observations from a historical period (selection of analogs from the GCM chosen to optimally match the historical weather states might achieve similar results). The precipitation-based methods are compared with conventional statistical downscaling using SVD with various large-scale predictors such as geopotential height, temperature, and humidity. The skill of the different methods for reconstructing historical wintertime precipitation (1958-94) over Oregon and Washington is tested on various spatial scales as small as 50 km and on temporal scales from months to decades. All methods using precipitation as a predictor perform considerably better than the conventional downscaling. The best results using conventional methods are obtained with geopotential height at 1000 hPa or humidity at 850 hPa as predictors. In these cases correlations of monthly observed and reconstructed precipitation on the 50-km scale range from 0.43 to 0.65. The inclusion of several predictor fields does not improve the reconstructions, since they are all highly correlated. Local rescaling of simulated precipitation yields much higher correlations between 0.7 and 0.9, with the exception of the rain shadow of the Cascade Mountains in the Columbia Basin (eastern Washington). When the simulated precipitation is used as a predictor in SVD-based downscaling correlations also reach 0.7 in eastern Washington. Dynamical correction improves the local scaling considerably in the rain shadow and yields correlations almost as high as with the SVD method. Its combination of high skill and ease to use make it particularly attractive for GCM precipitation downscaling.",2003,10.1175/1520-0442(2003)016<0799:SPDOTN>2.0.CO;2,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,WOS:000180965300002,Shana,Yes,Yes,Yes,Biome/National,regional precip,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Paris,Yes,Yes,Yes,regional precip,

The WB model includes the concepts of climatic water supply and climatic water demand, seasonality in climatic water supply and demand, and soil-moisture storage. Exhaustive search techniques were employed to determine the optimal set of precipitation and temperature stations, and the optimal set of WB model parameters to use for each basin. It was found that the WB model worked best for basins with: (1) a mean elevation less than 450 meters or greater than 2000 meters, and/or (2) monthly runoff that is greater than 5 millimeters (mm) more than 80 percent of the time. In a separate analysis, a multiple linear regression (MLR) was computed using the adjusted R-square values obtained by comparing measured and estimated monthly runoff of the original 44 river basins as the dependent variable, and combinations of various independent variables [streamflow gauge latitude, longitude, and elevation; basin area, the long-term mean and standard deviation of annual precipitation; temperature and runoff, and low-flow statistics (i.e., the percentage of months with monthly runoff that is less than 5 mm)]. Results from the MLR study showed that the reliability of a WB model for application in a specific region can be estimated from mean basin elevation and the percentage of months with gauged runoff less than 5 mm. The MLR equations were subsequently used to estimate adjusted R-square values for 1,646 gauging stations across the conterminous U.S. Results of this study indicate that WB models can be used reliably to estimate monthly runoff in the eastern U.S., mountainous areas of the western U.S., and the Pacific Northwest, Applications of monthly WB models in the central U.S. can lead to uncertain estimates of runoff.",2002,10.1111/j.1752-1688.2002.tb01001.x,Engineering; Geology; Water Resources,WOS:000176769300019,Shana,Yes,Yes,Yes,Biome/National,US Mtn West,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Paris,Yes,Yes,Yes,"climate focus, no explicit mention of climate change",

The delta change method uses differences between simulated current and future climate conditions from the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research (HadCM2) General Circulation Model (GCM) added to observed time series of climate variables. A statistical downscaling (SDS) model was developed for each basin using station data and output from the National Center for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) reanalysis regridded to the scale of HadCM2. The SDS model was then used to simulate local climate variables using HadCM2 output for current and future conditions. Surface climate variables from each scenario were used in a precipitation-runoff model. Results from this study show that, in the basins tested, a precipitation-runoff model can simulate realistic runoff series for current conditions using statistically downscaled NCEP output. But, use of downscaled HadCM2 output for current or future climate assessments are questionable because the GCM does not produce accurate estimates of the surface variables needed for runoff in these regions.

Climate scenarios produced by general circulation models (GCMs) do not provide enough spatial specificity for studying water resources in mountain watersheds. This study uses dynamical downscaling with a regional climate model (RCM) driven by a GCM to simulate climate change scenarios. The RCM uses a subgrid parameterization of orographic precipitation and land surface cover to simulate surface climate at the spatial scale suitable for the representation of topographic effects over mountainous regions. Numerical experiments have been performed to simulate the present-day climatology and the climate conditions corresponding to a doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentration. The RCM results indicate an average warming of about 2.5 degrees C, and precipitation generally increases over the Pacific Northwest and decreases over California. These simulations were used to drive a distributed hydrology model of two snow dominated watersheds, the American River and Middle Fork Flathead, in the Pacific Northwest to obtain more detailed estimates of the sensitivity of water resources to climate change. Results show that as more precipitation falls as rain rather than snow in the warmer climate, there is a 60 percent reduction in snowpack and a significant shift in the seasonal pattern of streamflow in the American River. Much less drastic changes are found in the Middle Fork Flathead where snowpack is only reduced by 18 percent and the seasonal pattern of streamflow remains intact. This study shows that the impacts of climate change on water resources are highly region specific.

A 'toy' model is used to demonstrate some of these effects, and these effects are also shown for streamflow data from Canada's Reference Hydrologic Basin Network.

Here, we study the simple Quaternary catchment-alluvial fan system of the Kuitun River, in northern Tian Shan, to discuss some ideas about sediment storage, release, and bypass in relatively short (100 km long) sediment routing systems. This study shows that the Kuitun catchment and piedmont areas clearly present evidence of a significant and temporary storage of sediments during the Pleistocene. These sediments were then excavated and delivered farther into the foreland basin during the Holocene. The difference between the volumes of materials released from the catchment and piedmont areas (5.5 +/- 1.7 km(3)) and the volume stored in a contemporaneous fan downstream (2.6 +/- 0.6 km(3)) indicates that the latter did not trap the whole sediment load transported by the river. The alluvial fan was bypassed by 27 to 78% of this load toward its distal alluvial plain. If this value is well estimated, it implies a major volumetric partitioning of the deposits between the fan and the alluvial plain, with a very high sedimentation rate in the fan (1.97 +/- 0.52 mm.y(-1)) and a much lower one downstream (0.11 +/- 0.11 mm.y(-1)). However, this volumetric partitioning might only occur during periods with a very specific hydrological regime such as the Holocene deglaciation. Eventually, the peculiar sediment storage and release pattern within the Kuitun catchment and piedmont areas during the Pleistocene and Holocene complicates the calculation of mean paleodenudation rates using either sediment budgets or in situ produced cosmogenic nuclides.

Here, we investigate changes in the elevational distribution of dung beetle species (Coleoptera: Scarabaeoidea) in two separate mountain regions in Europe. Location South-western Alps (France) and Sierra Nevada (Spain). Methods We compared historical and current data on dung beetle distributions along elevation gradients for 30 species in the SW Alps and 19 species in the Sierra Nevada. We tested for significant changes between survey periods in three parameters: mean elevation and upper and lower range limits. Results We found up-slope range shifts for 63% and 90% of the species in the SW Alps and Sierra Nevada, respectively. Up-slope range shifts resulted mainly from expansion of upper range limits in the SW Alps and from changes of both range limits in the Sierra Nevada. The magnitudes of range shifts were consistent with the level of warming experienced in each region, but they also reflected the asymmetrical warming observed along the elevation gradients. Smaller changes were observed for species reaching their historical range limits at the higher elevations, associated with a non-significant increase in temperature between periods. Main conclusions The differences observed between regions are related to the geographical position of each mountain range, which determines the characteristics (including thermal tolerance) of the regional species pool, and the level of warming, which determines whether maximum thermal tolerance has been exceeded for the majority of species in the region.

In this study, a water resources management model was developed for the upper west slope Sierra Nevada to understand the potential effects of regional climate warming on hydropower at the watershed scale, a scale that has been largely neglected but is important for hydroregional planning. The model is developed with the Water Evaluation and Planning system (WEAP) and includes most water management infrastructure in the study region. Hydropower is simulated assuming historical long-term electricity demand and a spill minimization rule. The method is suitable for simulating generation for most of the main watersheds in the region. To assess the potential effect of climate warming, uniform air temperature increases of 0 degrees C, 2 degrees C, 4 degrees C, and 6 degrees C were considered, with no change in precipitation, to approximate regional warming through 2100.

The Catchment land surface model (CLSM), a distributed land surface model (LSM) with a multilayer, physically based snow model, has been applied in the upstream part of this watershed, where snowfall accounts for 50% of the precipitation. The CLSM subdivides the upper Durance watershed, where elevations range from 800 to 4000 m within 3580 km(2), into elementary catchments with an average area of 500 km(2). The authors first show the difference between the dynamics of the accumulation and ablation of the snow cover using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images and snow-depth measurements. The extent of snow cover increases faster during accumulation than during ablation because melting occurs at preferential locations. This difference corresponds to the presence of a hysteresis in the snow-cover depletion curve of these catchments, and the CLSM was adapted by implementing such a hysteresis in the snow-cover depletion curve of the model. Different simulations were performed to assess the influence of the parameterizations on the water budget and the evolution of the extent of the snow cover. Using six gauging stations, the authors demonstrate that introducing a hysteresis in the snow-cover depletion curve improves melting dynamics. They conclude that their adaptation of the CLSM contributes to a better representation of snowpack dynamics in an LSM that enables mountainous catchments to be modeled for impact studies such as those of climate change.",2014,10.1175/JHM-D-13-091.1,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,WOS:000334179500007,Adrienne,No,Yes,No,,,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Shana,No,,International,France,

The generation of this 'Boundary Sandstone' was previously ascribed to a period of reduced subsidence; however, a new carbon isotope record presented herein shows it to be intimately correlated to the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), an extreme global warming event ca. 56 Ma. This study evaluates the impacts of the PETM on fluvial deposition in the basin by integrating sedimentological data with geochemical, palaeoichnological, and palaeobotanical proxy records. Compared to pre- and post-PETM fluvial sand bodies, the Boundary Sandstone is more highly amalgamated, both vertically and laterally, but shows no changes in lithofacies associations, palaeodispersal directions, palaeoflow depths, or palaeochannel widths. At its thickest, the Boundary Sandstone resides entirely within the main body of the PETM, an ca. 113kyr time interval when global pCO(2) levels and temperatures were at their highest, and local mean annual rainfall low, floodplains well drained and vegetation comparatively sparse. The totality of data sets imply that the Boundary Sandstone is related to the preferential removal of fine-grained floodplain deposits by either: (i) rapid readjustments in river gradients related to documented short-term precipitation oscillations or (ii) reductions in the cohesiveness of overbank sediments related to decreased rooting density and water table fluctuations. Hence, short-term climate perturbations may manifest within large-scale depositional patterns in ways ostensibly like tectonics.",2014,10.1111/bre.12027,Geology,WOS:000332857800001,Adrienne,No,Maybe,No,,,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Shana,No,,No,,

Our analysis showed that several factors and processes explain the standing biomass of lichens (during 2005-2008) and the recent changes in this biomass (after 1995-1996) on lichen pastures located in the 20 northernmost herding districts in Finland. The higher the long-term reindeer densities on the lichen pastures the lower was the lichen biomass. The lichen biomass was also strongly affected by the grazing system; the lowest biomass values of lichens were measured in all grazing areas that were used in the snow-free seasons. The lichen biomass in pine forests less than 80 years old and in all mountain type lichen pastures was lower than that in mature and old pine forests. The lichen biomass also decreased as the proportion of arboreal lichen pastures within a district decreased and the proportion of human infrastructure increased. The aerial drift of heavy metals from the Kola Peninsula appeared to reduce lichens in a small north-eastern part of the study area. Increases in summer precipitation and winter temperatures increased the amount of lichens, but increases in summer temperatures and winter precipitation had the opposite effect. Reindeer densities, grazing system, pasture type and the previous abiotic factors were also associated with the reduction in lichen biomass between the inventories. We conclude that several local, regional and even global factors and processes affect the state of reindeer pastures in large and complex grazing ecosystems. Therefore, more comprehensive research and management strategies for the entire reindeer herding environment are needed.",2014,10.1007/s10113-013-0508-5,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WOS:000333267700010,Adrienne,No,Maybe,No,,,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Shana,No,,International,Finland,

Wildfires can release a substantial amount of GHGs and other compounds to the atmosphere, so recent increases in fire activity may be increasing GHG emissions. Quantifying wildfire emissions however can be difficult due to inherent variability in fuel loads and consumption and a lack of field data of fuel consumption by wildfire. We compare a unique set of fuel data collected immediately before and after six wildfires in coniferous forests of California to fuel consumption predictions of the first-order fire effects model (FOFEM), based on two different available fuel characterizations. We found strong regional differences in the performance of different fuel characterizations, with FOFEM overestimating the fuel consumption to a greater extent in the Klamath Mountains than in the Sierra Nevada. Inaccurate fuel load inputs caused the largest differences between predicted and observed fuel consumption. Fuel classifications tended to overestimate duff load and underestimate litter load, leading to differences in predicted emissions for some pollutants. When considering total ground and surface fuels, modeled consumption was fairly accurate on average, although the range of error in estimates of plot level consumption was very large. These results highlight the importance of fuel load input to the accuracy of modeled fuel consumption and GHG emissions from wildfires in coniferous forests.

A good example of a program that seeks to mitigate mega-fires is located in Western Australia, where prescribed burning reduces wildfire intensity while conserving ecosystems. Crown-fire-adapted ecosystems are likely at higher risk of frequent mega-fires as a result of climate change, as compared with other ecosystems once subject to frequent less severe fires.

Large parts of the Jettan rockslide are located right below the discontinuous permafrost limit in the arctic part of the alpine landscape of northern Norway. Combining four years of meteorological and rockslide deformation data with temperature measurements from different parts of open fractures, shallow bedrock boreholes and air, as well as daily snow cover observations, allows a detailed identification of the key processes involved. These field data are the basis for the development of a permafrost controlled rockslide model. Seasonally, the deformation has a very distinctive pattern with high deformation starting abruptly right after snowmelt in May, and lasting until snow isolation in winter. Then there is a gradual transition to medium deformation as the ground is cooled further for another 1-2 months. Finally, the winter period, when maximum snow occurs in the fractures, is characterized by limited or almost no deformation. The primary controlling deformation process is meltwater percolation into fractures in summer with significant refreezing, ice formation and temperature increase in the lower part of the fractures from -1 degrees C to 0 degrees C. Sporadic permafrost exists below the discontinuous permafrost limit, and may extend into open fractures and sliding planes. Another primary process is the significant cold air accumulation in fractures in early winter, due to the Balch effect, which significantly cools the fracture and surrounding rock promoting permafrost development. Finally, the cold air effect is stopped by snow isolation once enough snow has accumulated in the fracture by late winter. The deformation itself is thought to be controlled by changing shear strength of the brecciated sliding planes due to either changing ice temperatures and/or variations in water infiltration to the unsaturated sliding zones. The overall system is very locally controlled driving itself, and the effect of a future climate change can thus be of minor importance. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This project led to the development of parallel, long (10(3) - 10(4) year) ice-core records of climate and atmospheric change over an altitudinal range of more than 2 km, from the Eclipse Icefield (3017 m) to the ice-covered plateau of Mt. Logan (5340 m). These efforts built on earlier work recovering single ice cores in this region. Comparison of these records has allowed for variations in climate and atmospheric composition to be linked with changes in the vertical structure and dynamics of the North Pacific atmosphere, providing a unique perspective on these changes over the Holocene. Owing to their privileged location, cores from the St. Elias Icefields also contain a remarkably detailed record of aerosols from various sources around or across the North Pacific.

Based on these principles, we provide general recommendations for managing and protecting freshwater ecosystems and the fisheries they support, with examples of successful implementation for each strategy. Key management strategies include engage and consult with stakeholders; ensure that agencies have sufficient capacity, legislation, and authority to implement policies and management plans; define metrics by which fisheries resources and management success or failure will be measured; identify and account for threats to ecosystem productivity; adopt the precautionary approach to management; embrace adaptive management; implement ecosystem-based management; account for all ecosystem services provided by aquatic ecosystems; protect and restore habitat as the foundation for fisheries; and protect biodiversity.

Significant variations in natural headwater contributions have been observed due to warming climate. Projecting future natural headwater flows under climate change effects, however, has large uncertainty. First, there are difficulties in climate modeling and downscaling in alpine regions. Second, streamflow modeling in mountainous areas is extremely challenging. There is therefore a need to understand the effects of uncertainty in the natural inflow regime, and in particular how this translates into uncertainty in representing the state and the outflow of water resource systems. Considering the Oldman River basin in Alberta, Canada, we synthesized different inflow regimes based on site/inter-site properties of the historical inflow regime. The water resources system was then conditioned on the synthesized inflow regimes to identify the mechanisms of error propagation from the headwater streamflows to the water allocations. The results show that the response of the water resource system to the uncertainty in the generated inflow regime depends on the system state, flow condition and the component of interest. Generally, the response of the reservoirs to the uncertainty in the estimated inflow regime is more significant in dry years, in particular during low flow conditions. The response at the system outlet is rather different, as the propagation of the headwater uncertainty is more significant during high flow conditions. Also, similar inflow estimates in terms of error and uncertainty may result in different error and uncertainty estimates in the simulated outflows; therefore, lower bias and uncertainty in estimating the regional inflow regime does not necessarily mean lower bias and uncertainty in simulating the streamflow at the outlet of the system. Our results provide improved understanding of uncertainty propagation through complex water resource systems, but also portray the need for better climate and hydrological modeling in the Rocky Mountains for improved water management in the Canadian Prairies, particularly in the face of uncertain climate futures. This will be crucial if the natural headwater inflows decline and/or the system faces drought conditions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Human suppression of fire in the western United States over the last century has caused notable changes to many ecosystems, especially in lower elevation, semiarid forest types dominated historically by fire tolerant taxa like Pinus and Quercus. Recent increases in fire activity in western US forests have highlighted the need for restoration of ecological structure and function, but management targets for restoration in different forest types remain uncertain. Working in the forests of eastern California, we evaluated the direction and magnitude of change in burned area and fire severity between the period prior to Euro-American settlement (similar to 1500-1850) and the ""modern'' period (1984-2009). We compared total annual area burned; proportional area burned at low-moderate severity and high severity; and annual area burned at low-moderate severity and high severity between the two time periods in seven forest types. We also examined modern trends in fire area and severity. We found that modern rates of burning are far below presettlement levels for all forest types. However, there were major differences between low to middle elevation forests and high elevation forests regarding the components of this departure. Low and middle elevation forests are currently burning at much higher severities than during the presettlement period, and the departure in fire area is overwhelmingly expressed in the low to moderate severity categories; in these forest types, mean annual area of high severity fire is not notably different between the modern and presettlement periods. In higher elevation forests on the other hand, the modern departure in fire area is expressed equally across fire severity categories. Our results underline the critical need for forest and fire restoration in the study area, especially in low and middle elevation forests adapted to frequent, low severity fire.

These blowdowns resulted in substantial redistribution of forest carbon by snapping and uprooting trees, thereby increasing instream wood recruitment, recruitment of dead wood to the forest floor, and exposure of organic soil on uprooted tree plates. Estimates of carbon redistribution at five sites in Rocky Mountain National Park range as high as 308Mg C/ha in high-severity patches to 106Mg C/ha in low-severity patches, of which typically 10-30% is soil C and the remainder is downed wood. Masses of carbon redistributed from living to dead biomass at high-severity sites represent a substantial portion of average total biomass in old-growth subalpine forests in the region. Consequently, the potential for increasing frequency and/or severity of blowdowns under a warming climate represents a significant potential source of terrestrial carbon to the atmosphere. The majority of this carbon is in the form of downed wood that becomes a carbon source to the atmosphere, although interactions between downed wood and river processes can locally increase carbon storage in floodplain soil. Predictions of changes in precipitation and wind patterns, and associated changes in wildfire and insect infestation, suggest that blowdowns may become more common in future in the Southern Rockies, but the consequences for carbon dynamics depend on site-specific interactions between blowdowns and other processes such as floodplain storage of organic matter.",2013,10.1002/2013GB004633,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,WOS:000329686900020,Adrienne,No,Maybe,No,,,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Shana,No,,No,,

These are characteristics typical of many species that occupy small, cold streams. Habitat use, vulnerabilities and mechanisms for coping with local conditions can differ among populations and ontogenetically within populations, potentially affecting species-level responses to climate change. However, we still have little knowledge of mean thermal performance for many vertebrates, let alone variation in performance among populations. Assessment of these sources of variation in thermal performance is critical for projecting the effects of climate change on species and for identifying management strategies to ameliorate its effects. To gauge how populations of the Rocky Mountain tailed frog (Ascaphus montanus) might respond to long-term effects of climate change, we measured the ability of tadpoles from six populations in Glacier National Park (Montana, U.S.A.) to acclimate to a range of temperatures. We compared survival among populations according to tadpole age (1year or 2years) and according to the mean and variance of late-summer temperatures in natal streams. The ability of tadpoles to acclimate to warm temperatures increased with age and with variance in late-summer temperature of natal streams. Moreover, performance differed among populations from the same catchment. Our experiments with a cold-water species show that population-level performance varies across small geographic scales and is linked to local environmental heterogeneity. This variation could influence the rate and mode of species-level responses to climate change, both by facilitating local persistence in the face of changes in thermal conditions and by providing thermally tolerant colonists to neighbouring populations.",2013,10.1111/fwb.12202,Marine & Freshwater Biology,WOS:000325156400001,Adrienne,Yes,Yes,Yes,,west side streams are in CRB,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Shana,No,,No,,

These changes may be more pronounced in mineralized watersheds due to the sensitivity of sulfide weathering to changes in subsurface oxygen transport. Specific causal mechanisms linking climate change and accelerated weathering rates have been proposed, but in general remain entirely hypothetical. For mineralized watersheds, a favored hypothesis is that falling water tables caused by declining recharge rates allow an increasing volume of sulfide-bearing rock to become exposed to air, thus oxygen. Here, we test the hypothesis that falling water tables are the primary cause of an increase in metals and SO4 (100-400%) observed since 1980 in the Upper Snake River (USR), Colorado. The USR drains an alpine watershed geologically and climatologically representative of many others in mineralized areas of the western U. S. Hydrologic and chemical data collected from 2005 to 2011 in a deep monitoring well (WP1) at the top of the USR watershed are utilized. During this period, both water table depths and groundwater SO4 concentrations have generally increased in the well. A numerical model was constructed using TOUGHREACT that simulates pyrite oxidation near WP1, including groundwater flow and oxygen transport in both saturated and unsaturated zones. The modeling suggests that a falling water table could produce an increase in metals and SO4 of a magnitude similar to that observed in the USR (up to 300%). Future water table declines may produce limited increases in sulfide weathering high in the watershed because of the water table dropping below the depth of oxygen penetration, but may continue to enhance sulfide weathering lower in the watershed where water tables are shallower. Advective air (oxygen) transport in the unsaturated zone caused by seasonally variable recharge and associated water table fluctuations was found to have little influence on pyrite oxidation rates near WP1. However, this mechanism could be important in the case of a shallow dynamic water table and more abundant/reactive sulfides in the shallow subsurface. Data from WP1 and numerical modeling results are thus consistent with the falling water table hypothesis, and illustrate fundamental processes linking climate and sulfide weathering in mineralized watersheds.

The Colorado River (western United States) is well suited for such an analysis because the eroding source (Colorado Plateau) and sediment sinks in transtensional basins of the Salton Trough and northern Gulf of California are intact and well preserved. Using the distribution of Late Miocene basalt flows and new thermochronologic data, we calculate that similar to 3.4 +/- 1.2 x 10(5) km(3) of rock has been eroded from the Colorado Plateau since 10 Ma. Most of this erosion probably started ca. 5.5-6 Ma, when the river system became integrated and incision rates increased dramatically. We generate two estimates for the volume of Colorado River sediment that has accumulated in basinal sinks since ca. 5.3 Ma: (1) 2.8 +/- 0.6 x 10(5) km(3), assuming that crust between 5 and 10-12 km depth in the plate-boundary basins is young metasedimentary rock mixed with intrusions; and (2) 1.55 +/- 0.35 x 10(5) km(3), assuming that crust below 4-5 km is thinned pre-Cenozoic crystalline rock. The broad overlap of the first estimate with the calculated volume of rock eroded from the plateau provides new support for a model of lithospheric rupture and rapid sedimentation in the Salton Trough. Assuming an average density of 2.3-2.5 g/cm(3), and using the range of preferred volume estimates calculated here, the total mass transferred is similar to 5.1-11.5 x 10(14) t representing an average flux of similar to 156 +/- 60 Mt/yr since 5.3 Ma, the time when the Colorado River first arrived in the Salton Trough, or 172 +/- 66 Mt/yr if we assume that all sediment flux took place after 4.8 Ma. The calculated long-term flux is strikingly similar to historical pre-dam sediment discharge measured at Yuma (Arizona) in the early 1900s (172 +/- 64 Mt/yr). The similarity of flux estimates suggests that rates of erosion and sediment discharge in this system have been consistent, on average, over modern to geologic time scales. We suggest that ongoing positive feedback between late Cenozoic erosion and flexural uplift on the Colorado Plateau provides a mechanism that could sustain steady rates of regional erosion and sediment production for millions of years after integration of the Colorado River ca. 5.5-6 Ma.",2013,10.1130/GES00784.1,Geology,WOS:000324679200004,Adrienne,No,Maybe,No,,,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Shana,No,,No,,

The objectives are to quantify for 23 cities in seven climatic regions (1) water supply provided from rainwater harvested at a residential parcel and (2) stormwater runoff reduction from a residential drainage catchment. Water-saving efficiency is determined using a water-balance approach applied at a daily time step for a range of rainwater cistern sizes. The results show that performance is a function of cistern size and climatic pattern. A single rain barrel (190 l [50 gal]) installed at a residential parcel is able to provide approximately 50% water-saving efficiency for the nonpotable indoor water demand scenario in cities of the East Coast, Southeast, Midwest, and Pacific Northwest, but <30% water-saving efficiency in cities of the Mountain West, Southwest, and most of California. Stormwater management benefits are quantified using the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency Storm Water Management Model. The results indicate that rainwater harvesting can reduce stormwater runoff volume up to 20% in semiarid regions, and less in regions receiving greater rainfall amounts for a long-term simulation. Overall, the results suggest that U.S. cities and individual residents can benefit from implementing rainwater harvesting as a stormwater control measure and as an alternative source of water.",2013,10.1111/jawr.12038,Engineering; Geology; Water Resources,WOS:000322580500006,Adrienne,Maybe,No,No,Ecosystem/Municipal,,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Shana,No,,No,,

In general, we observed brown trout spawning activity between the end of October and the beginning of January. The spawning duration differed significantly, however, between rivers, ranging from 28 to 72days. Analysis of environmental parameters for their influence on spawning activity revealed mean water temperature and altitude as the most explanatory variables. Detailed investigation of redd characteristics based on water velocity, water depth and substrate size clearly showed differences between positions on the redd. Brown trout in Alpine rivers preferred to use velocities of 30-40cms-1, water depths of 10-20cm and substrates of 16-32mm for spawning. It has to be noted, however, that recorded values cover almost the whole range of data on spawning habitats that has been reported in literature so far. A special focus of this study was on egg burial depths, which were surprisingly not found to differ significantly between the rivers despite their different flow regimes. Recorded egg burial depths were, however, found to be distinctly lower (mean burial depth: 3.8cm) than reported by almost any study so far. We see this observation of low burial depths in Alpine rivers as useful in the context of scouring effects, especially when evaluating the influence of scouring on fish populations.",2013,10.1111/eff.12033,Fisheries; Marine & Freshwater Biology,WOS:000319872900005,Adrienne,No,Yes,No,,,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Shana,No,,No,,

Here, we apply a bioclimate envelope model that tracks habitat of individual populations to estimate adaptational lags for 15 wide-ranging forest tree species in western North America. An ensemble classifier modeling approach (RandomForest) was used to spatially project the climate space of tree populations under observed climate trends (1970s to 2000s) and multi-model projections for the 2020s, 2050s and 2080s. We find that, on average, populations already lag behind their optimal climate niche by approximately 130 km in latitude, or 60 m in elevation. For the 2020s we expect an average lag of approximately 310 km in latitude or 140 m in elevation, with the most pronounced geographic lags in the Rocky Mountains and the boreal forest.

We used cluster analysis to identify thermally distinct groups among sampled sites within the lake and then developed and independently validated a set of linked regression models designed to estimate daily water temperatures for each spatially distinct thermal group using daily air temperature data. When daily air temperatures projections, generated for 2080-2099 by a regional climate model, were used as input to these group models, projected increases in summer surface water temperatures of as much as 3 A degrees C were projected.

Two-dimensional modelling of habitat has focused primarily on fishes, but fish-based assessments may not model benthic macroinvertebrate habitat effectively. We extend two-dimensional techniques to a macroinvertebrate assemblage in a high-elevation stream in the Sierra Nevada (Dana Fork of the Tuolumne River, Yosemite National Park, CA, USA). This stream frequently flows at less than 0.03m3s1 in late summer and is representative of a common water abstraction scenario: maximum water abstraction coinciding with seasonally low flows. We used two-dimensional modelling to predict invertebrate responses to reduced flows that might result from increased abstraction. We collected site-specific field data on the macroinvertebrate assemblage, bed topography and flow conditions and then coupled a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model with macroinvertebrate indices to evaluate habitat across a range of low flows. Macroinvertebrate indices were calculated for the wetted area at each flow. A surrogate flow record based on an adjacent watershed was used to evaluate frequency and duration of low flow events. Using surrogate historical records, we estimated that flow should fall below 0.071m3s1 at least 1day in 82 of 95years and below 0.028m3s1 in 48 of 95years. Invertebrate metric means indicated minor losses in response to modelled discharge reductions, but wetted area decreased substantially. Responses of invertebrates to water abstraction will likely be a function of changing habitat quantity rather than quality.

The elevation history of this region is tightly linked to the tectonic, climatic and landscape evolution of western North America but is not well constrained. Here we use an atmospheric general circulation model with integrated oxygen isotope tracers (isoCAM3) to predict how isotope ratios of precipitation would change along the North American Cordillera as the mean elevation of orogenic highlands increased from 1200 m to 3975 m. With increases in mean elevation, highland temperatures fall, monsoonal circulation along the eastern front of the Cordillera is enhanced, and wet season (generally spring and summer) precipitation increases. Simulated oxygen isotopic ratios in that precipitation are compared to those obtained from geologic materials (e.g. fossil bivalves, authigenic minerals). Quantification of match between model and data-derived delta O-18 values suggests that during the Late Cretaceous, the best approximation of regional paleoelevation in western North America is a large orogen on the scale of the modern Andes Mountains with a mean elevation approaching 4000 m and a north-south extent of at least 15 of latitude.

Changes in likelihood of forest disturbance (wildfire, insects, logging, etc.) may also have impacts that are compounded by climate change. This study evaluates the impacts of climate and forest changes on streamflow in the upper parts of the Oldman River in Southern Alberta using a conceptual hydrological model, HBV-EC (Hydrologiska Byrans attenbalansavdelning, Environment Canada), in combination with a stochastic weather generator (LARS-WG) driven by GCM (global climate model) output climate data. Three climate change scenarios (A1B, A2 and B1) are selected to cover the range of possible future climate conditions (2020s, 2050s, and 2080s). The GCM projected less than a 10% increase in precipitation in winter and a similar amount of precipitation decrease in summer. These changes in projected precipitation resulted in up to a 200% (9.3 mm) increase in winter streamflow in February and up to a 63% (31.2 mm) decrease in summer flow in June. Flow also decreased in July and August, when irrigation is important; these reduced river flows during this season could impact agriculture production. The amplification in the streamflow is mostly driven by the projected increase in temperature that is predicted to melt winter snow earlier, resulting in lower water availability during the summer. Uncertainty analysis was completed using a guided GLUE (generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation) approach to obtain the best 100 parameter sets and associated ranges of streamflows. The impacts of uncertainty in streamflows were higher in spring and summer than in winter and fall. Forest change compounded the climate change impact by increasing the winter flow; however, it did not reduce the summer flow.",2013,10.5194/hess-17-4941-2013,Geology; Water Resources,WOS:000329061400016,Becky,Yes,Yes,Yes,Landscape/State-Province,"Southwestern Alberta Rocky Mountains, impacts of CC on streamflow ....",NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Shana,No,,No,"Southwestern Alberta Rocky Mountains, impacts of CC on streamflow ....",

The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, applied at a 30 km grid resolution, is used in conjunction with a 3-D radiative transfer parameterization covering a time period from 1 November 2007 to 31 May 2008, during which abundant snowfall occurred. A comparison of the 3-D WRF simulation with the observed snow water equivalent (SWE) and precipitation from Snowpack Telemetry (SNOTEL) sites shows reasonable agreement in terms of spatial patterns and daily and seasonal variability, although the simulation generally has a positive precipitation bias. We show that 3-D mountain features have a profound impact on the diurnal and monthly variation of surface radiative and heat fluxes, and on the consequent elevation-dependence of snowmelt and precipitation distributions. In particular, during the winter months, large deviations (3-DPP, in which PP denotes the plane-parallel approach) of the monthly mean surface solar flux are found in the morning and afternoon hours due to shading effects for elevations below 2.5 km. During spring, positive deviations shift to the earlier morning. Over mountaintops higher than 3 km, positive deviations are found throughout the day, with the largest values of 40-60 W m(-2) occurring at noon during the snowmelt season of April to May. The monthly SWE deviations averaged over the entire domain show an increase in lower elevations due to reduced snowmelt, which leads to a reduction in cumulative runoff. Over higher elevation areas, positive SWE deviations are found because of increased solar radiation available at the surface. Overall, this study shows that deviations of SWE due to 3-D radiation effects range from an increase of 18% at the lowest elevation range (1.5-2 km) to a decrease of 8% at the highest elevation range (above 3 km). Since lower elevation areas occupy larger fractions of the land surface, the net effect of 3-D radiative transfer is to extend snowmelt and snowmelt-driven runoff into the warm season. Because 60-90% of water resources originate from mountains worldwide, the aforementioned differences in simulated hydrology due solely to 3-D interactions between solar radiation and mountains/snow merit further investigation in order to understand the implications of modeling mountain water resources, and these resources' vulnerability to climate change and air pollution.",2013,10.5194/acp-13-11709-2013,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,WOS:000328616800007,Becky,Yes,Yes,Yes,Landscape/State-Province,"Rocky Mountains and Sierra Nevada, WRF model",NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Shana,No,,No,"Rocky Mountains and Sierra Nevada, WRF model",

Simulations were evaluated using point-based measurements of SWE, precipitation, and temperature that showed Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency coefficients of 0.83, 0.97, and 0.80, respectively. Spatial accuracy was shown to be 82% using snow cover extent from the Landsat Thematic Mapper. The validated model then evaluated the inter-and intra-year sensitivity of basin wide snowpack to projected temperature increases (2 degrees C) and variability in precipitation (+/- 10 %). Results show that a 2 degrees C increase in temperature would shift the average date of peak snowpack 12 days earlier and decrease basin-wide volumetric snow water storage by 56 %. Snowpack between the elevations of 1000 and 2000m is the most sensitive to increases in temperature. Upper elevations were also affected, but to a lesser degree. Temperature increases are the primary driver of diminished snowpack accumulation, however variability in precipitation produce discernible changes in the timing and volumetric storage of snowpack. The results of this study are regionally relevant as melt water from the MRB's snowpack provides critical water supply for agriculture, ecosystems, and municipalities throughout the region especially in summer when water demand is high.

We use the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrologic model at daily time scale, forced by climate projections from 16 global climate models under greenhouse gas emissions scenarios B1 and A2, to evaluate likely hydrologic responses in these watersheds for 1950-2099. Comparing climate in the latter half of the 20th Century to projections for 2070-2099, we find that all projections indicate continued temperature increases, by 2-5 A degrees C, but differ on precipitation changes, ranging from -24 % to +56 %. As a result, the fraction of precipitation falling as rain is projected to increase, from a historical 0.19 to a range of 0.26-0.52 (depending on the GCM and emission scenario), leading to earlier timing of the annual hydrograph's center, by a range of 9-37 days. Snowpack accumulation depends on temperature and even more strongly on precipitation due to the high elevation of these watersheds (reaching 4,000 m), and projected changes for April 1 snow water equivalent range from -67 % to +9 %. We characterize the watershed's hydrologic response using variables integrated in space over the entire simulated area and aggregated in time over 30-year periods. We show that from the complex dynamics acting at fine time scales (seasonal and sub-seasonal) simple dynamics emerge at this multi-year time scale. Of particular interest are the dynamic effects of temperature. Warming anticipates hydrograph timing, by raising the fraction of precipitation falling as rain, reducing the volume of snowmelt, and initiating snowmelt earlier. This timing shift results in the depletion of soil moisture in summer, when potential evapotranspiration is highest. Summer evapotranspiration losses are limited by soil moisture availability, and as a result the watershed's water balance at the annual and longer scales is insensitive to warming. Mean annual runoff changes at base-of-mountain stations are thus strongly determined by precipitation changes.",2013,10.1007/s10584-012-0529-y,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,WOS:000312632700006,Becky,No,Yes,No,,Sierra Nevada,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Shana,No,,No,Sierra Nevada,

For instance, warming in spring and summer and shifts towards earlier snowmelt are associated with an increase in wildfire activity and tree mortality in mountain forests in the western United States(1,2). Temperature increases are expected to continue during the twenty-first century in mountain ecosystems across the globe(3,4), with uncertain consequences. Here, we examine the influence of interannual variations in snowpack accumulation on forest greenness in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, California, between 1982 and 2006. Using observational records of snow accumulation and satellite data on vegetation greenness we show that vegetation greenness increases with snow accumulation. Indeed, we show that variations in maximum snow accumulation explain over 50% of the interannual variability in peak forest greenness across the Sierra Nevada region.

The National Park Service (NPS) transplanted mountain goats from the Olympic Mountains to other ranges between 1981 and 1989 as a means to manage overabundant populations, and began monitoring population trends of mountain goats in 1983. We estimated population abundance of mountain goats during 18-25 July 2011, the sixth survey of the time series, to assess current population status and responses of the population to past management.

Most existing knowledge about the sequence and timing of distinct structural stages following stand origin in unmanaged (not actively managed in > 50 years) forests has been derived from forests in North America, which are characterized by particular topographic, climatic, biotic and other environmental factors. Thus, the effects on structural development remain poorly understood for many other forest systems, such as the dense, unmanaged, subalpine Norway spruce forests of the Swiss Alps. Over the past century, land abandonment and reductions in active forest management have led to a substantial increase in the density of these forests types. Consequently, many stands are entering the stem exclusion stage and are currently characterized by associated self-thinning mortality. However, the environmental influences on the rate of this structural development as well as this structural stage itself have not yet been examined. We studied stem exclusion processes based on forest inventory data (National Swiss Forest Inventory; NFI) over three survey periods (1983-1985, 1993-1995 and 2004-2006) using repeated measures statistics. To complement these analyses, we also collected and analysed 3,700 increment cores from 20 field plots within dense subalpine Norway spruce forests dispersed across the Swiss Alps. Over the past decades, basal area (BA) has generally increased, particularly on N-facing and steeper slopes, and within 300 m of potential treeline. The number of dead trees was higher on N-facing compared with S-facing slopes, but the BA of dead wood was higher on S-facing slopes. Tree ring analysis confirmed important differences in growth patterns between N- and S-facing slopes and verified the results of the NFI analysis.

In addition, the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis data are also downscaled for the same period to display the performance of the regional climate model for the same region, which constitutes a relatively complex terrain and rich variety of climates. The gridded observational dataset of CRU is primarily used in the evaluation of the models, however, a regional dataset, which is based on a relatively dense gauging network, is also used to see how it affects the performance measures of the models. The reanalysis simulation indicates that RegCM3 is able to simulate the precipitation and surface temperature as well as the upper level fields reasonably well. However, it tends to overestimate the precipitation over the mountainous areas. All three GCM models are found to be highly skilled in simulating the winter precipitation and temperature in the region. The two models, ECHAM5 and HadCM3, are also good at simulating the summer precipitation and temperature, but the CCSM3 simulation generates dryer and warmer conditions than the observations for the whole region, which are most likely a result of the dryness in the upper levels of the original outputs. The use of the regional observational dataset does not necessarily improve the pattern correlations, but it yields better match between the modeled and observed precipitation in terms of variability and root-mean-square difference. It could be said that the outputs of these GCMs can be used in the climate change downscaling and impact assessment studies for the region, given that their strengths and weaknesses that are displayed in the present study are considered.",2012,10.1007/s00382-011-1187-x,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,WOS:000305745100012,Becky,No,Yes,No,,eastern Mediterranean-Black Sea,Paris,No,Yes,No,,Black Sea/ Med.,NA,,,,,Shana,No,,No,eastern Mediterranean-Black Sea,

The goal of our study was to examine temporal trends and spatial patterns in ecologically relevant hydrological variables within the Athabasca River watershed and the downstream PeaceAthabasca Delta (PAD), located in northwestern Canada. Temporal trends for a suite of indicators of hydrologic alteration, appropriate for cold regions environments, were explored using non-parametric MannKendall trend analysis. Results in the Lower Athabasca River (LAR) watershed were placed in a watershed-scale context. Across the two study periods (A 1958-2009 and B 1974-2009), results indicated decreasing trends in several key drivers of deltaic system hydrology, including short-term and long-term maximum and minimum runoff. In addition, an increasing trend in hydrograph variability was observed within the watershed. A spatially discrete pattern was apparent from the data, with a greater number of significant trends noted within the headwater region as compared with other areas of the watershed. Although earlier dates of annual freeze-up were observed across the watershed, there were few observable patterns in ice-on/ice-off conditions on the river. If these historical trends in freeze-up continue on the LAR, water levels in the PAD channels and inland wetlands could be affected, leading to reduced habitat diversity and altered ecosystem productivity. The study illustrates significant natural variability in the hydrological regime within the LAR that should be considered in future water management frameworks to ensure the preservation and maintenance of this Ramsar wetland site, particularly in the context of projected climate change and the increased water demands arising from upstream development associated with the Alberta Oil Sands.

Using sequence data from the trnH-psbA and trnT-trnL chloroplast DNA spacer regions, we investigated the phylogeography of the widespread, ancient (>3 million years) arctic-alpine plant Oxyria digyna (Polygonaceae). We identified 45 haplotypes and six highly divergent major lineages; estimated ages of these lineages (time to most recent common ancestor, T-MRCA) ranged from similar to 0.5 to 2.5 million years. One lineage is widespread in the arctic, a second is restricted to the southern Rocky Mountains of the western United States, and a third was found only in the Himalayan and Altai regions of Asia. Three other lineages are widespread in western North America, where they overlap extensively. The high genetic diversity and the presence of divergent major cpDNA lineages within Oxyria digyna reflect its age and suggest that it was widespread during much of its history. The distributions of individual lineages indicate repeated spread of Oxyria digyna through North America over multiple glacial cycles. During the Last Glacial Maximum it persisted in multiple refugia in western North America, including Beringia, south of the continental ice, and within the northern limits of the Cordilleran ice sheet.

This study investigates the potential hydrologic effects of such warming when combined with the full range of precipitation variability experienced over the past millennium. Using the upper Yellowstone drainage as a test case, a water balance model is constructed to estimate river discharge from precipitation and temperature inputs (r = 0.85 versus observed). The model then was run using tree ring precipitation estimates for 1177-1910 and 1911-1995 A. D. combined with (1) average observed temperatures 1896-1995; (2) reconstructed Northern Hemisphere temperatures since 1177; or (3) Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change temperature projections for 2025, 2050, and 2100. Discharge estimates generated by driving the model with tree ring precipitation for 1911-1995 and observed temperatures served as a baseline for comparisons with other climate runoff scenarios. All combinations of the various temperature scenarios and pre-1911 precipitation resulted in mean discharge below the gauge period baseline. Projected temperatures for 2050 and 2100 produced the lowest mean discharge at 85% and 76% of baseline, respectively. Combining observed temperatures with the paleoprecipitation scenarios created numerous multidecadal periods with discharge <85% of baseline. Discharge during these same multidecadal droughts declined an additional 16-34% under the 2025-2100 temperature regimes. Likewise inherent multidecadal precipitation variability adds a large degree of nonstationarity to the climate change responses seen in discharge estimates. While this combined tree ring and water balance scenario exercise does not provide precise forecasts for future conditions, these results suggest that a 1 degrees-3 degrees C warming could have major negative effects on water availability in the upper Yellowstone. These results also indicate that twentieth-century observations paint an incomplete and potentially overly optimistic picture of regional water supplies.",2010,10.1029/2008WR007650,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Water Resources,WOS:000280746800001,Courtney,No,Yes,Yes,Landscape/State-Province,"upper Yellowstone, climate model",NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Shana,Maybe,Yes,No,"upper Yellowstone, climate model",

Agriculture, urbanization or forestry in river catchments can influence river organisms through diffuse effects on hydrology and hydrochemistry, or local effects on habitat character, bank erosion and sediment delivery. Riparian buffer zones are sometimes established to mitigate undesirable effects on salmonids, but consequences for organisms such as macroinvertebrates are less well known. 2. Riparian fencing and tree coppicing were carried out on upland tributaries of the Welsh River Wye (UK) from 1997 onwards with the aim of enhancing conditions for salmonid fish. The present study used routine, agency monitoring data to compare assemblages in three recently managed streams and five adjacent control streams. Data between 1995 and 2004 were used to assess treatment effects through time. 3. Post-treatment (2000-2004) assemblages were richer in recently managed streams than in controls, mostly due to apparent gains of taxa typical of channel margins and lowland, warmer conditions. However, results were equivocal because invertebrate families typical of lowland, more eutrophic conditions increased in occurrence in all reaches irrespective of treatment, while overall richness declined. 4. This study illustrates how routine monitoring data can reveal some effects of riparian land-use and management on stream biota. However, improved experimental design, ideally using a before after control intervention approach, would have allowed more effective assessment in this case study where confounding trends were so marked. We advocate using such approaches in future restoration studies to allow stronger inference and greater statistical power. The recent general decline in the richness of typical headwater organisms in the Wye system requires investigation.

We describe climate warming models for 15 west-slope Sierra Nevada watersheds in California under unimpaired conditions using WEAP21, a weekly one-dimensional rainfall-runoff model. Incremental climate warming alternatives increase air temperature uniformly by 2 degrees, 4 degrees, and 6 degrees C, but leave other climatic variables unchanged from observed values. Results are analyzed for changes in mean annual flow, peak runoff timing, and duration of low flow conditions to highlight which watersheds are most resilient to climate warming within a region, and how individual watersheds may be affected by changes to runoff quantity and timing. Results are compared with current water resources development and ecosystem services in each watershed to gain insight into how regional climate warming may affect water supply, hydropower generation, and montane ecosystems. Overall, watersheds in the northern Sierra Nevada are most vulnerable to decreased mean annual flow, southern-central watersheds are most susceptible to runoff timing changes, and the central portion of the range is most affected by longer periods with low flow conditions. Modeling results suggest the American and Mokelumne Rivers are most vulnerable to all three metrics, and the Kern River is the most resilient, in part from the high elevations of the watershed.

These watersheds are situated at the headwaters of streams and rivers that supply much of the water to downstream users in the western United States. Responses of streamflow to vegetation manipulations have been, and are, one of the research foci in this water-deficient part of the country. The watershed-scale research, led by the U.S. Forest Service and its cooperators, has spanned nearly a century and included an array of vegetation types along a wide range of precipitation gradients. Results from this research have shown that vegetation can be managed to enhance annual water yields while still providing the other natural resource benefits. Analyses of the research results suggest that the effect of vegetation manipulation on streamflow is associated with precipitation-elevational gradient and, therefore, vegetation type. An annual water yield increase between 25 and 100 mm could be achieved by implementing vegetation manipulations in the high elevation subalpine and mixed conifer forests, the ponderosa pine forests (in the Lower Basin), and portions of the low elevation chaparral shrublands. Negligible effects or small increases in water yield were observed for treating sagebrush, pinyon-juniper woodland and desert scrubs.

We compared the chemical composition of snowfall and snowpack collected during and after the dust deposition event with pre-event snow at 17 sites extending from central Colorado into southern Wyoming. The chemistry of dust-event snowfall and the post-event snowpack were compared to long-term wetfall precipitation and snowpack chemistry at the Fraser Experimental Forest (FEF). The pH of the snowpack formed during the dust event was 1.5 units higher, calcium was 10-fold higher, and acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) was 100-fold higher than levels measured in either early or late-season snow. Elevated ANC was attributable to dust-derived increase in carbonate/bicarbonate ions, likely from soluble calcium carbonate inclusions in dust material. The single dust event contributed carbonate/bicarbonate-derived ANC equivalent to the sum of strong acids deposited during the entire winter at FEF. Effects appeared more pronounced at upper elevations and in the sparse forest near treeline, compared to densely forested lower elevation sites. Monthly snowpack solute analysis at FEF has not documented an event of similar magnitude during its 17-year period of record. The solute composition of post-event snow is similar to average Fraser streamwater, however.

Fish in this Study selected foraging positions that enabled them to maximize NEI, and most fish were capable of sustaining high growth rates from July to September.

In alpine regions, reduced snow accumulation and earlier melt of seasonal snowpacks are expected hydrologic consequences of warming. For forests, this leads to earlier soil moisture recharge, and may increase summer drought stress. At the same time, increased air temperature alters plant net primary productivity. Most models of climate change impacts focus either on hydrologic behaviour or ecosystem structure or function. In this Study we address the interactions between them. We use a Coupled model of eco-hydrologic processes to estimate changes in evapotranspiration and vegetation productivity under temperature warming scenarios. Results from Yosemite National Park, in the California Sierra Nevada, suggest that for most snow-dominated elevations, the shift in the timing of recharge is likely to lead to declines in productivity and vegetation water use, even with increased water-use efficiency associated with elevated atmospheric CO(2) concentrations. The strength of this effect, however, depends upon interactions between several factors that vary substantially across elevation gradients, including the initial timing of melt relative to the Summer growing season, vegetation growth, and the extent to which initial vegetation is water-limited or temperature-limited. These climate-driven changes in vegetation water use also have important implications for summer streamflow. Results from this analysis provide a framework that can be used to develop strategic measurement campaigns and to extrapolate from local measurements of vegetation responses to watershed scale patterns.

The growth surge has occurred only in a limited elevational band within approximate to 150 m of upper treeline, regardless of treeline elevation. Both an independent proxy record of temperature and high-elevation meteorological temperature data are positively and significantly correlated with upper-treeline ring width both before and during the high-growth interval. Increasing temperature at high elevations is likely a prominent factor in the modern unprecedented level of growth for Pinus longaeva at these sites.",2009,10.1073/pnas.0903029106,Science & Technology - Other Topics,WOS:000272254400040,Courtney,No,,No,,Great Basin,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Shana,No,,No,Great Basin,

In this article we report on the landscape level extent of grassland loss to shrub encroachment in a portion of the Rocky Mountain Forest Reserve in southwestern Alberta, Canada, and review the associated implications for simultaneously supporting livestock and wildlife populations while maintaining range health on this diminishing vegetation type. Digitized aerial photographs of 12 km of valley bottom from 1958 and 1974 were co-registered to ortho-rectified digital imagery taken in 1998, and an un-supervised classification used to determine areas associated with grassland and shrubland in each year. Field data from 2002 were over-layed using GPS coordinates to refine the classification using a calibration-validation procedure. Over the 40-year study period, open grasslands declined from 1,111 ha in 1958 to 465 ha in 1998, representing a 58% decrease. Using mean production data for grass and shrub dominated areas we then quantified aggregate changes in grazing capacity of both primary (grassland) and secondary (shrubland) habitats for livestock and wildlife. Total declines in grazing capacity from 1958 to 1998 totaled 2,744 Animal Unit Months (AUMs) of forage (-39%), including a 58% decrease in primary (i.e., open grassland) range, which was only partly offset by the availability of 1,357 AUMs within less productive and less accessible shrubland habitats. Our results indicate shrub encroachment has been extensive and significantly reduced forage availability to domestic livestock and wildlife, and will increase the difficulty of conserving remaining grasslands. Although current grazing capacities remain marginally above those specified by regulated grazing policies, it is clear that continued habitat change and decreases in forage availability are likely to threaten the condition of remaining grasslands. Unless shrub encroachment is arrested or grassland restoration initiated, reductions in aggregate ungulate numbers may be necessary.",2009,10.1007/s00267-009-9328-2,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WOS:000268901300009,Courtney,No,,No,,Alberta Canada Rangelands,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Shana,No,,No,Alberta Canada Rangelands,

Wastage is the ice melt volume that exceeds the volume of snow accumulation into the glacier system in a hydrological year, causing an annual net loss of glacier volume. Melt is the ice melt volume that is equal to, or less than, the volume of snow that accumulates into the glacier system in a hydrological year. By our definition then, glacier Melt is a storage term and does not contribute to increased total annual streamflow. Water is stored as snow on accumulation into the glacier system, and the water equivalent runoff is delayed until ice melts in the late summer months of the otherwise low streamflow. Wastage varied between basins with similar glacierized areas reflecting the individual response of glaciers to climate, contributing over 10% to July-to-September streamflow in some headwater basins, but under 3% annually to the regulated flow at Edmonton and Calgary. Melt was positively correlated with basin glacierized area and contributed over 27% to July-to-September flow from basins with greater than 1% glacierized area, and over double the wastage volume at Edmonton and Calgary. Future glacier decline is therefore expected to result mainly in an advancement of peak flow towards a non-glacierized snowmelt regime hydrogaph, resulting in significantly reduced late summer flows further reduced by decreasing wastage contributions.

Integrated environmental models, combining climatic and hydrologic models, are often used for this purpose. This paper examines the impact of uncertainties related to GCMs in hydrological impact studies in the tropical Andes. A conceptual hydrological model is calibrated on data from four mesoscale, mountainous catchments in south Ecuador. The model inputs are then perturbed with anomalies projected by 20 GCMs available from the IPCC Data Distribution Centre. The results show that on average, the average monthly discharge is not expected to change dramatically. However, the simulated discharges driven by different global climate model forcing data can diverge widely, with prediction ranges often surpassing current discharge. Citation: Buytaert, W., R.

Remote sensing offers unique opportunities for detection of forest disturbance at multiple scales: however, spatially and temporally continuous mapping of non-stand replacing disturbance remains challenging. First, most high spatial resolution satellite sensors have relatively broad spectral ranges with bandwidths unsuitable for detection of subtle, stress induced, features in canopy reflectance. Second, directional and background reflectance effects, induced by the interactions between the sun-sensor geometry and the observed canopy surface, make up-scaling of empirically derived relationships between changes in spectral reflectance and vegetation conditions difficult. Using an automated tower based spectroradiometer, we analyse the interactions between canopy level reflectance and different stages of disturbance occurring in a mountain pine beetle infested lodgepole pine stand in northern interior British Columbia, Canada, during the 2007 growing season. Directional reflectance effects were modelled using a bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) acquired from high frequency multi-angular spectral observations. Key wavebands for observing changes in directionally corrected canopy spectra were identified using discriminant analysis and highly significant correlations between canopy reflectance and field measured disturbance levels were found for several broad and narrow waveband vegetation indices (for instance, r(NDVI)(2)=0-90: r(CHL3)(2)=0.85; p < 0.05). Results indicate that multi-angular observations are useful for extraction of disturbance related changes in canopy reflectance, in particular the temporally and spectrally dense data detected changes in chlorophyll content well. This study will help guide and inform future efforts to map forest health conditions at landscape and over increasingly coarse scales. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

The lake occupies a closed basin system whose chemistry reflects solute inputs from the weathering of a diverse suite of rocks in its drainage basin. GSL is the remnant of a much larger lacustrine body, Lake Bonneville, and it has a long history of carbonate deposition. Inflow to the lake is from three major rivers that drain mountain ranges to the east and empty into the southern arm of the lake, from precipitation directly on the lake, and from minor groundwater inflow. Outflow is by evaporation. The greatest solute inputs are from calcium bicarbonate river waters mixed with sodium chloride-type springs and groundwaters. Prior to 1930 the lake concentration inversely tracked lake volume, which reflected climatic variation in the drainage, but since then salt precipitation and re-solution, primarily halite and mirabilite, have periodically modified lake-brine chemistry through density stratification and compositional differentiation. In addition, construction of a railway causeway has restricted circulation, nearly isolating the northern from the southern part of the lake, leading to halite precipitation in the north. These and other conditions have created brine differentiation, mixing, and fractional precipitation of salts as major factors in solute evolution.

The spatially explicit snowpack model was coupled to the Alpine Hydrochemical Model (AHM), and estimates of hydrochemistry at the basin outlflow were compared with the baseline AHM approach, which implicitly prescribes snowmelt. The proportions of total meltwater production from soil, talus, and rock subunits were 46, 25, and 29%, respectively, for the baseline simulation without our advanced snowmelt representation. Conversely, simulations in which the AHM was coupled to our distributed snowmelt model ascribed the largest meltwater production to talus (47%) subunits, with 37% ascribed to soil and 16% ascribed to rock. Accounting for these differences in AHM reduced model overestimates of cation concentration during snowmelt; modeled Ca(2+) estimates explained 82 and 70% (P values < 0.01) of observations with and without the coupled model, respectively. Similarly, the coupled model explained more variability in nitrate concentrations, with 83 versus 70% (P values < 0.01) explained by the coupled and baseline models, respectively. Early snowmelt over talus subunits was not detected at the basin outflow, confirming earlier reports that deeper flow paths are needed in biogeochemical models of alpine systems.

We argue that FFTL, backed up by data from high-precision distributed temperature sensors, can be a useful tool in locating flowing fractures and in estimating the transport properties of unsaturated fractured rocks. We have developed the theoretical background needed to analyze data from FFTL. In this article, we present a simplified conceptualization of FFTL in unsaturated fractured rock and develop a semi-analytical solution for spatial and temporal variations of pressure and temperature inside a borehole in response to an applied perturbation (pumping of air from the borehole). We compare the semi-analytical solution with predictions from the TOUGH2 numerical simulator. On the basis of the semi-analytical solution, we propose a method to estimate the permeability of the fracture continuum surrounding the borehole. Using this proposed method, we estimated the effective fracture continuum permeability of the unsaturated rock hosting the Drift Scale Test (DST) at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. Our estimate compares well with previous independent estimates for fracture permeability of the DST host rock. The conceptual model of FFTL presented in this article is based on the assumptions of single-phase flow, convection-only heat transfer, and negligible change in system state of the rock formation. In a sequel article, we extend the conceptual model to evaluate some of these assumptions. In that paper, we also perform inverse modeling of FFTL data to estimate, in addition to permeability, other transport parameters (such as porosity and thermal conductivity) of unsaturated fractured rocks.",2008,10.1029/2008WR006860,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Water Resources,WOS:000260604900001,Courtney,No,Yes,No,,Yucca Mountain,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Shana,No,,No,Yucca Mountain,

These palaeoclimate indicators provide the primary evidence for palaeoclimate change during the Late Palaeozoic, and have been used to infer a long-term climatic transition from humid to and conditions on equatorial Pangaea from Late Pennsylvanian through Early Permian time. The cause(s) of Late Pennsylvanian-Early Permian climate trends are unknown but must have resulted from climate factors operating on timescales of tectonic change (10(6)-10(7) yr), such as tectonic drift, assembly of Pangaea, orogenesis, and long-term carbon cycling. Although higher-resolution, local-to regional-scale palaeoclimate reconstructions for the Late Pennsylvanian-Early Permian exist, they generally lack the time control necessary for accurate correlation among sites. Nevertheless, these high-resolution palaeoclimate reconstructions provide details about Permo-Pennsylvanian palaeoclimate that are not perceptible in lower-resolution global datasets. These studies indicate that (1) although the Late Pennsylvanian equatorial latitudes were more humid than the Early Permian tropics, there was also considerable variability in the amount and seasonality of rainfall, and (2) there were several short (<< 1-3 Ma) excursions toward relatively more humid climate during the long-term Early Permian transition to aridity in western and central equatorial Pangaea. These higher-resolution climate changes were controlled by climate factors which operated on relatively short timescales (10(4)-10(6) yr) such as continental ice-sheet dynamics, sea-level change and associated changes in land-sea distribution, and variations in palaeoatmospheric PCO(2). Although lithological indicators and geochemical proxies provide the basis for reconstructing past climate, they seldom provide diagnostic evidence to determine which of the possible climate factors were important. To narrow the possible causes of Late Pennsylvanian-Early Permian climate change, we review and evaluate both conceptual and numerical models that have been previously used to explain Late Palaeozoic climate change in light of the detailed spatial and temporal proxy records from across near-equatorial Pangaea. Our ability to test these models is currently limited by our inability to make accurate correlations among proxy sites due to uncertain dating. Nonetheless, we suggest that on tectonic timescales continental drift, increasing atmospheric PCO(2), and deglaciation could explain much of the low-latitude climate record, while changing atmospheric PCO(2) and orbitally-driven glacial-interglacial cycles could account for higher-resolution climate variability on Pangaea.

To evaluate how past climate variability has influenced the composition, structure and fire regime of the Siskiyou forests, pollen, charcoal, and lithological evidence was examined from two lakes along a moisture gradient to reconstruct the vegetation, fire and climate history. The late-glacial/Early Holocene transition period, subalpine parkland was replaced by a closed forest of Pinus, Cupressaceae, Abies and Pseudotsuga and more frequent fires a 1000 years earlier at the wetter site, and it is likely that reduced Pacific Ocean upwelling created warmer drier conditions at the coast. In the Early Holocene, Pinus, Cupressaceae were less abundant and fire less frequent at the coastal site during a period of increased coastal upwelling and fog production. In the Late Holocene, Abies, Pseudotsuga, Pinus, and Quercus vaccinifolia increased in the forest at both sites suggesting a widespread response to cooling. Fewer fires at the wetter site may account for the abundance of Picea breweriana within the last 1000 years. The comparison of the two records implies that large-scale controls in climate during the last 14,000 cal yr BP have resulted in major changes in vegetation and fire regime. Asynchrony in the ecosystem response of wetter and drier sites arises from small-scale spatial variations in effective moisture and temperature resulting from topographically-influenced microclimates and coastal-to-inland climate gradients.

Franco] from the International Tree-Ring Data Bank to study radial growth response to historical climate variability. For the coastal variety of Douglas-fir, we found positive correlations of ring width with summer precipitation and temperature of the preceding winter, indicating that growth of coastal populations was limited by summer dryness and that photosynthesis in winter contributed to growth. For the interior variety, low precipitation and high growing season temperatures limited growth. Based on these relationships, we chose a simple heat moisture index (growing season temperature divided by precipitation of the preceding winter and current growing season) to predict growth response for the interior variety. For 105 tree ring chronologies or 81% of the interior samples, we found significant linear correlations with this heat moisture index, and moving correlation functions showed that the response was stable over time (1901-1980). We proceeded to use those relationships to predict regional growth response under 18 climate change scenarios for the 2020s, 2050s, and 2080s with unexpected results: for comparable changes in heat moisture index, the most southern and outlying populations of Douglas-fir in Mexico showed the least reduction in productivity. Moderate growth reductions were found in the southern United States, and strongly negative response in the central Rocky Mountains. Growth reductions were further more pronounced for high than for low elevation populations. Based on regional differences in the slope of the growth-climate relationship, we propose that southern populations are better adapted to drought conditions and could therefore contain valuable genotypes for reforestation under climate change.

Maximum carbon losses following disturbance (g C m(-2)y(-1)) ranged from 1270 in Florida to 200 in boreal ecosystems. Similarly, for forests less than 100 years old, maximum uptake (g C m(-2)y(-1)) was 1180 in Florida mangroves and 210 in boreal ecosystems. More temperate forests had intermediate fluxes. Boreal ecosystems were relatively time invariant after 20 years, whereas western ecosystems tended to increase in carbon gain over time. This was driven mostly by gross photosynthetic production (GPP) because total ecosystem respiration (ER) and heterotrophic respiration were relatively invariant with age. GPP/ER was as low as 0.2 immediately following stand-replacing disturbance reaching a constant value of 1.2 after 20 years. NEP following insect defoliations and silvicultural thinning showed lesser changes than stand-replacing events, with decreases in the year of disturbance followed by rapid recovery.

Interannual variability of these characteristics is relevant to the effect of climate change on alpine hydrology. Our objective is to characterize the interannual variability in the spatial distribution of snow and energy fluxes of snowmelt in watersheds of a maritime setting, Tokopah Basin (TOK) in California's southern Sierra Nevada, and a continental setting, Green Lake 4 Valley (GLV4) in Colorado's Front Range, using a 12 year database (1996-2007) of hydrometeorological observations and satellite-derived snow cover. Snowpacks observed in GLV4 exhibit substantially greater spatial variability than in TOK (0.75 versus 0.28 spatial coefficient of variation). In addition, modeling results indicate that the net turbulent energy flux contribution to snowmelt in GLV4 is, on average, 3 times greater in magnitude (mean 29% versus 10%) and interannual variability (standard deviation 17% versus 6%) than in TOK. These energy flux values exhibit strong seasonality, increasing as the melt season progresses to times later in the year (R-2 = 0.54-0.77). This seasonality of energy flux appears to be associated with snowmelt rates that generally increase with onset date of melt (0.02 cm d(-2)). This seasonality in snowmelt rate, coupled to differences in hydrogeology, may account for the observed differences in correspondence between the timing of snowmelt and timing of streamflow in these watersheds.",2012,10.1029/2011WR011006,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Water Resources,WOS:000300824300002,Danny,No,Yes,No,Landscape/State-Province,,NA,,,,,,Meghan,No,,No,CO and CA,Shana,No,,No,,

Increasing areas of high-severity fire can occur when greater area is burned at constant proportion of high-severity fire, or when the proportion of high-severity fire within fire perimeters increases, or some combination of both. For the Sierra Nevada Forest Plan Amendment (SNFPA) area, which includes forestlands in eastern California and western Nevada, Miller et al. (2009a) concluded that the proportion of area burning at high severity in mixed-conifer forests had risen over the 1984 to 2004 period. However, no statistical assessment was made of the temporal trend in high-severity fire area because the analyzed dataset was incomplete in the early years of the study period. In this update, we use satellite-derived estimates of fire severity from the three most widely distributed SNFPA forest types to examine the trend in percent high severity and high-severity fire area for all wildfires >= 80 ha that occurred during the 1984 to 2010 period. Time-series regression modeling indicates that the percentage of total high severity per year for a combination of yellow pine (ponderosa pine [Pinus ponderosa Lawson & C. Lawson] or Jeffrey pine [P. jeffreyi Balf.]) and mixed-conifer forests increased significantly over the 27-year period. The annual area of high-severity fire also increased significantly in yellow pine-mixed-conifer forests. The percentage of high severity in fires >= 400 ha burning in yellow pine-mixed-conifer forests was significantly higher than in fires <400 ha. Additionally, the number of fires >= 400 ha significantly increased over the 1950 to 2010 period. There were no significant trends in red fir (Abies magnifica A. Murray bis) forests.

In 2007, a number of rock fall events occurred on the sharp SE-ridge of the mountain Mittlerer Burgstall (2933 m a.s.l., 47 degrees 06' 07? N; 12 degrees 42' 36? E) completely changing the shape of the mountain. Before the events, the SE-ridge was sharp with steep rock faces on both sides. The mountain was a nunatak surrounded by two glacier tongues of Pasterze Glacier during the Little Ice Age. In this paper we use geomorphological mapping, permafrost distribution modelling, glacier reconstruction, surface and near-surface ground temperature data, air temperature data, and airborne laserscanning data to assess these multiple rock fall events. Results show that the entire area of detachment covers 3100 m2. The areas of transportation and deposition cover 85 000 m2 partly contributing to the supraglacial debris cover of Pasterze Glacier. The volume of all rock fall deposits is about 56 000 m3. Permafrost modelling and ground temperature monitoring indicate that the area of detachment is located near the lower limit of discontinuous permafrost. Permafrost is relatively warm and thin at the summit area of Mittlerer Burgstall with a mean temperature of only 1.0 inverted perpendicular C at 1.8 m depth in 2007-2010. Substantial surface lowering of the glacier tongues surrounding the mountain on both sides (by -250 and -70 m since the Little Ice Age) changed the stress and strain field in the bedrock. Furthermore, the generally highly fractured bedrock favoured slope instability. The triggering event for the rock falls were most likely the effects of the warm winter of 2006/07 which was 2.24.8 degrees C warmer compared to the seven winters before.

We explore the use of this controversial technique using a threatened keystone species in western North America, whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis), as a case study. Species distribution models predict that whitebark pine will be extirpated from most of its current range as temperatures rise over the next 70 years. However, the same models indicate that a large area within northwestern British Columbia, Canada, is climatically suitable for the species under current conditions and will remain so throughout the 21st century. To test the capacity of whitebark pine to establish relative to Climatic and habitat features within its predicted climatic range, we planted seeds from seven populations in eight locations spanning from 600 km southeast to 800 km northwest of the northern boundary of the current species range. During the first three growing seasons, germination occurred in all locations. Nearly three times as many treated (induced maturation and broken dormancy) than untreated seeds germinated, and most treated seeds germinated a year earlier than the untreated seeds. Germination, survival, and growth were primarily influenced by seed mass, site climate conditions related to the duration of snow cover, and provenance temperature. Our experiment provides a preliminary test of models predicting the existence of climatically suitable whitebark pine habitat north of the current species ranges. More broadly, our techniques and results inform the development of scientific guidelines for assisting the migration of other species that are highly threatened by climate change.

We established science-management partnerships on the Olympic National Forest (Washington) and Tahoe National Forest (California) in the first effort to develop adaptation options for specific national forests. We employed a focus group process in order to establish the scientific context necessary for understanding climate change and its anticipated effects, and to develop specific options for adapting to a warmer climate. Climate change scientists provided the scientific knowledge base on which adaptations could be based, and resource managers developed adaptation options based on their understanding of ecosystem structure, function, and management. General adaptation strategies developed by national forest managers include: (1) reduce vulnerability to anticipated climate-induced stress by increasing resilience at large spatial scales, (2) consider tradeoffs and conflicts that may affect adaptation success, (3) manage for realistic outcomes and prioritize treatments that facilitate adaptation to a warmer climate, (4) manage dynamically and experimentally, and (5) manage for structure and composition. Specific adaptation options include: (1) increase landscape diversity, (2) maintain biological diversity, (3) implement early detection/rapid response for exotic species and undesirable resource conditions, (4) treat large-scale disturbance as a management opportunity and integrate it in planning, (5) implement treatments that confer resilience at large spatial scales, (6) match engineering of infrastructure to expected future conditions, (7) promote education and awareness about climate change among resource staff and local publics, and (8) collaborate with a variety of partners on adaptation strategies and to promote ecoregional management. The process described here can quickly elicit a large amount of information relevant for adaptation to climate change, and can be emulated for other national forests, groups of national forests with similar resources, and other public lands. As adaptation options are iteratively generated for additional administrative units on public lands, management options can be compared, tested, and integrated into adaptive management.

Passive samplers deployed across the country revealed annually averaged air concentrations of chlorothalonil, endosulfan, and pendimethalin that were higher in areas with intensive agricultural activities than in more remote areas. Atmospheric concentrations were particularly high in the intensively cultivated central valley. Only endosulfan and its degradation products were found in soils sampled along an altitudinal transect on the northern side of Volcano Turrialba, which is facing heavily cultivated coastal plains. Consistent with calculations of cold trapping in tropical mountains, concentrations of endosulfan sulfate increased with altitude. Pesticide levels in lake, creek, fog, and arboreal water samples from high-elevation cloud forests were generally below 10 ng center dot L(-1). Endosulfan sulfate was the most abundant pesticide in water, with concentrations ranging from 0.4 to 9.4 ng center dot L(-1). Its levels were highest in water sampled from bromeliads. Levels of total endosulfan in water are much lower than the reported median lethal concentration (LC50) value for acute toxicity of alpha-endosulfan to tadpoles. Although this suggests that the presence of pesticide might not have a direct impact on amphibian populations, the possibility of effects of chronic exposure to a mixture of substances cannot be excluded. Fog was relatively enriched in some of the analyzed pesticides, such as dacthal and chlorothalonil, and may constitute an important deposition pathway to high-altitude tropical cloud forest. Environ.

Quantitative methods for estimating lichen population density and community composition are essential to effectively assess species and community response to ecological and environmental change. In this study we used two distance methods (point-centered quarter and quartered-neighbor methods), along with a compound estimator (Diggle's) to remove bias from non-random spatial patterns, to estimate Xanthoparmelia population density at a generic level on the summit of a high elevation plateau in southern Utah, USA. The sampling was extended to assess species composition and diversity. Population densities and relative species abundance were evaluated between meadow areas, sites, cardinal directions, and general substrate classes. We found that Xanthoparmelia populations varied widely in density and community composition across a relatively homogeneous landscape. Microhabitat, meadow-wide, and plateau-wide factors significantly influenced density and community structure in Xanthoparmelia. Our data reemphasize the inherent variability found in lichen communities and the importance of effective sampling for accurate ecological and biomonitoring studies. The two distance methods implemented here, moderated by Diggle's population density estimator, provide an efficient alternative to cover methods for estimating density.

An inventory based on 1:24,000 topographic maps revealed 1719 glaciers and perennial snowfields for a total area of 39.15 +/- 0.13 km(2). The number of 'true' glaciers, versus non-moving ice, is estimated to be 122 covering 14.89 +/- 0.08 km(2) or 38% of the ice-covered area. Historic photographs, geologic evidence, and field mapping were used to determine the magnitude of area change over the past century at 14 glaciers. The area change between 1903 and 2004 ranged from -31% to -78%, averaging -55%. Based on these values rough estimates of volume change suggest an ice volume loss from 1903 (1.09 km(3)) to 2004 (0.43 km(3)) of 0.66 km(3) (0.59 km(3) water). Rapid retreat occurred over the first half of the 20th century beginning in the 1920s and continued through the 1960s after which recession ceased by the early 1980s and some glaciers advanced. Since the late 1980s glaciers resumed retreat with a rapid acceleration starting in the early 2000s. The relatively uniform timing of area changes in the study glaciers is a response to regional climate whereas the magnitude of change is influenced by local topographic effects. Area changes correlate significantly with changes in summer and winter air temperatures. Warmer winter temperatures warm the snowpack lengthening the summer melt season. Spring air temperatures and precipitation may also play an important role. The occurrence of spring snowfall can delay the onset of melt due to the increased surface albedo. Examining the influence of topographic variables we only found headwall height at the top of the glacier to show an influence on glacier change. Higher headwalls shadow the glacier from solar radiation reducing melt and enhancing snow accumulation via avalanching.

Productive, mesic riparian forests can accumulate high stem densities and fuel loads, making them susceptible to high-severity fire. Fuels treatments applied to upland forests, however, are often excluded from riparian areas due to concerns about degrading streamside and aquatic habitat and water quality. Objectives of this study were to compare stand structure, fuel loads, and potential fire behavior between adjacent riparian and upland forests under current and reconstructed active-fire regime conditions. Current fuel loads, tree diameters, heights, and height to live crown were measured in 36 paired riparian and upland plots. Historic estimates of these metrics were reconstructed using equations derived from fuel accumulation rates, current tree data, and increment cores. Fire behavior variables were modeled using Forest Vegetation Simulator Fire/Fuels Extension. Riparian forests were significantly more fire prone under current than reconstructed conditions, with greater basal area (BA) (means are 87 vs. 29 m(2)/ha), stand density (635 vs. 208 stems/ha), snag volume (37 vs. 2 m(3)/ha), duff loads (69 vs. 3 Mg/ha), total fuel loads (93 vs. 28 Mg/ha), canopy bulk density (CBD) (0.12 vs. 0.04 kg/m(3)), surface flame length (0.6 vs. 0.4 m), crown flame length (0.9 vs. 0.4 m), probability of torching (0.45 vs. 0.03), predicted mortality (31% vs. 17% BA), and lower torching (20 vs. 176 km/h) and crowning indices (28 vs. 62 km/h). Upland forests were also significantly more fire prone under current than reconstructed conditions, yet changes in fuels and potential fire behavior were not as large. Under current conditions, riparian forests were significantly more fire prone than upland forests, with greater stand density (635 vs. 401 stems/ha), probability of torching (0.45 vs. 0.22), predicted mortality (31% vs. 16% BA), and lower quadratic mean diameter (46 vs. 55 cm), canopy base height (6.7 vs. 9.4 m), and frequency of fire tolerant species (13% vs. 36% BA). Reconstructed riparian and upland forests were not significantly different. Our reconstruction results suggest that historic fuels and forest structure may not have differed significantly between many riparian and upland forests, consistent with earlier research suggesting similar historic fire return intervals.

We measured seasonal changes in PL fluxes to 20 small streams flowing through temperate rain forests in southwestern British Columbia to determine how riparian forest type and riparian management history influence resource availability in these systems. Differences in PL fluxes among the four riparian forest types studied were most pronounced in the summer, when PL fluxes from clearcuts < riparian reserve strips and coniferous forests, and PL fluxes from deciduous-dominated forests < riparian reserve strips. PL fluxes also varied among seasons (spring < summer < autumn). Fluxes were similar in riparian reserve strips and coniferous forests of similar age, indicating that reserve strips maintain this crucial ecosystem process. Clearcutting of riparian forests dramatically increased light availability while reducing leaf litter inputs; these effects, however, lasted only a few years.

Several biogeographical models have been proposed to account for the unique history of alpine populations, with different expectations of genetic divergence and speciation. The expanding alpine archipelago model proposes that alpine populations expand spatially and demographically during glacial events, dispersing between mountain ranges. Under this model, alpine populations are unlikely to diverge in isolation due to substantial interpopulation gene flow. In contrast, the alpine archipelago refuge model proposes that gene flow during glacial phases is limited and populations expand demographically during interglacial phases, increasing genetic isolation and the likelihood of speciation. We assess these models by reconstructing the evolutionary history of Colias behrii, a morphologically and ecologically distinct alpine butterfly restricted to the California Sierra Nevada. C. behrii exhibits very low genetic diversity at mitochondrial and nuclear loci, limited population structure and evidence of population expansion. C. behrii and Rocky Mountain C. meadii share identical mitochondrial haplotypes, while in contrast, nuclear data indicate common ancestry between C. behrii and Cascades Range Colias pelidne. The conflict in gene genealogies may be a result of recent expansion in North American Colias, but an isolation with migration analysis indicates that genetic patterns in C. behrii might result from differential introgression following hybridization. Based on the timing of population expansion and gene flow between mountain ranges, the expanding alpine archipelago model is supported in C. behrii.",NA,,,,Danny,No,No,No,Ecosystem/Municipal,Sierra Mevada,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Shana,No,,No,Sierra Mevada,

Soil genesis and landscape processes were studied in the southern Fry Mountains, Mojave Desert, California. Our aim was to better understand the processes responsible for the distribution of soil properties in this landscape. Measured properties in 65 soil pits across the study site show that dust, soluble salt, NO(3)(-)-N, and carbonate distributions are correlated with the prevailing wind direction. This finding suggests that the mountain range effectively traps eolian sediment. Soils mantling these mountains have accumulated, on average, 41 kg m(-2) silicate dust, 172 g m(-2) soluble salts, 3.3 g m(-2) NO(3)(-)-N, and 79 kg m(-2) carbonate and reached maximum concentrations of 156 kg m(-2), 1800 g m(-2), 43 g m(-2), and 398 kg m(-2), respectively, on windward sides of the range.

In order to test our hypothesis that differential responses of production and respiration to temperature and moisture shape the carbon balance across a range of spatio-temporal scales, we quantified net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 and carbon storage across the New Mexico Elevational Gradient, which consists of six eddy-covariance sites representing biomes ranging from desert to subalpine conifer forest. Within sites, hotter and drier conditions were associated with an increasing advantage of respiration relative to production such that daily carbon uptake peaked at intermediate temperatures - with carbon release often occurring on the hottest days - and increased with soil moisture. Across sites, biotic adaptations modified but did not override the dominant effects of climate. Carbon uptake increased with decreasing temperature and increasing precipitation across the elevational gradient; NEE ranged from a source of similar to 30 g C m-2 yr-1 in the desert grassland to a sink of similar to 350 g C m-2 yr-1 in the subalpine conifer forest. Total aboveground carbon storage increased dramatically with elevation, ranging from 186 g C m-2 in the desert grassland to 26 600 g C m-2 in the subalpine conifer forest. These results make sense in the context of global patterns in NEE and biomass storage, and support that increasing temperature and decreasing moisture shift the carbon balance of ecosystems in favor of respiration, such that the potential for ecosystems to sequester and store carbon is reduced under hot and/or dry conditions. This implies that projected climate change will trigger a substantial net release of carbon in these New Mexico ecosystems (similar to 3 Gt CO2 statewide by the end of the century), thereby acting as a positive feedback to climate change.",2011,10.1111/j.1365-2486.2010.02269.x,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WOS:000284851500034,Danny,No,Yes,No,Ecosystem/Municipal,N.

Results from our study illuminate two important aspects of the hydrological system that will have a direct impact on how this system responds to climate change: (1) recharge to the alluvial aquifer occurs primarily on the lower slopes of the catchment and is therefore sensitive to changes in snowline elevation and (2) deep groundwater in the western part of the aquifer is very young and provides very little buffering capacity. Although apparent groundwater ages indicate residence times range from less than a year to several decades, the water that recharges seasonally dominates the alluvial aquifer. Noble gas recharge temperatures are close to mean annual air temperature, and are 5 degrees-11 degrees higher than would be expected for direct influx of snowmelt. Excess air concentrations, indicating entrapment of air bubbles during recharge, are lower than would be expected for recharge through bedrock fractures.

Now, many ring-width index (RWI) chronologies, each representing a specific site and species, are archived online within the International Tree-Ring Data Bank (ITRDB). Comparing annual tree-ring-width data from 1097 sites in the continental United States to climate data, the authors quantitatively evaluated how trees at each site have historically responded to interannual climate variations. For each site, they developed a climate-driven statistical growth equation that uses regional climate variables to model RWI values. The authors applied these growth models to predict how tree growth will respond to twenty-first-century climate change, considering four climate projections. Although caution should be taken when extrapolating past relationships with climate into the future, the authors observed several clear and interesting patterns in the growth projections that seem likely if warming continues. Most notably, the models project that productivity of dominant tree species in the southwestern United States will decrease substantially during this century, especially in warmer and drier areas. In the northwest, nonlinear growth relationships with temperature may lead to warming-induced declines in growth for many trees that historically responded positively to warmer temperatures. This work takes advantage of the unmatched temporal length and spatial breath of annual growth data available within the ITRDB and exemplifies the potential of this ever-growing archive of tree-ring data to serve in meta-analyses of large-scale forest ecology.",2010,10.1175/2010EI362.1,Geology,WOS:000285545800001,Danny,No,Yes,No,Ecosystem/Municipal,Olympic Mtns,Meghan,,,Yes,,,NA,,,,,Shana,No,,No,Olympic Mtns,

We used long-term, geographically extensive data from the Welsh River Wye, formerly a major salmon river, to examine whether climatically mediated effects on juveniles (> 0+) might contribute to population change. Populations of Atlantic salmon and brown trout fell across the Wye catchment, respectively, by 50% and 67% between 1985 and 2004, but could not be explained by pollution because water quality improved during this time. Stream temperatures, estimated from calibrations against weekly air temperature at eight sites, increased by 0.5-0.7 degrees C in summer and 0.7-1.0 degrees C in winter, with larger tributaries warming more than shaded headwaters. Rates of winter warming were slightly greater after accounting for the effect of the North Atlantic Oscillation (1.1-1.4 degrees C). However, warming through time was smaller than measured variations among tributaries, and alone was insufficient to explain variations in salmonid density. Instead, population variations were best explained in multilevel mixed models by a synoptic variate representing a trend towards hotter, drier summers, implying interactions between climate warming, varying discharge and fluctuations in both brown trout and salmon. Taken alongside recent data showing effects of warming on survival at sea, these data suggest that Atlantic salmon might be jeopardized by future climatic effects in both their marine and freshwater stages. Effects on nondiadromous brown trout also imply climatically mediated processes in freshwaters or their catchments. Climate projections for the United Kingdom suggest that altered summer flow and increasing summer temperatures could exacerbate losses further in these species, and we advocate management actions that combine reduced abstraction with enhanced riparian shading.",2010,10.1111/j.1365-2486.2010.02211.x,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WOS:000283726600010,Danny,No,Yes,No,Ecosystem/Municipal,Welsh River Wye,Micah,No,Yes,Yes,,UK,NA,,,,,Shana,No,,No,Welsh River Wye,

These effects may play an important role in landscape evolution and, in particular, the response of river channels to tectonic or climatic perturbation. We use the channel-hillslope integrated landscape development ( CHILD) numerical model with two different bedrock incision models that include the dual role of the sediment flux to explore the transient behavior of fluvial landscapes. Both models predict that steady state channel slopes increase in landscapes with higher rock uplift rates. However, the incision models predict different transient responses to an increase in uplift rate, and the behavior of each incision model depends on both the magnitude of change in uplift rate and the local drainage area. In some cases, the transient channel behavior is indistinguishable from that predicted for transport-limited alluvial rivers. In other cases, knickpoints form in some or all of the drainage network, as predicted by the detachment-limited stream power model. In all cases the response in the lower parts of the network is highly dependent on the response in the upper parts of the network as well as the hillslopes. As the upper parts of the network send more sediment downstream, channel incision rates may rise or fall, and slopes in the lower parts of the channel may, in fact, decrease at times during the transient adjustment to an increase in rock uplift rate. In some cases, channel incision in the upper parts of the network ceases during the transient while the hillslopes adjust to the new uplift rate; drainage density may also change as a function of uplift rate. Our results suggest that if the sediment flux strongly controls bedrock incision rates, then ( 1) the transient fluvial response will take longer than predicted by the detachment-limited stream power model, ( 2) changes in channel slope may be much more complex than predicted by the detachment-limited stream power model, and ( 3) changes in the fluvial system will be closely tied to sediment delivery from the hillslopes. Importantly, our results outline quantitative differences in system behavior produced by competing models and provide a framework for identifying locations in natural systems where differences in channel morphology can be used to discern between competing fluvial erosion models.",2007,10.1029/2006JF000567,Geology,WOS:000246839700001,Meghan,No,,No,,,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Shana,Maybe,Maybe,No,too general,

An accepted 'correction' to Such changes by deducting the amount of contemporary sea level fall is wrong, since the air displaced by the ice sheets approximately fills the space left by the failing sea level and so there is no overall downward movement of the troposphere. This also causes a reduced cooling at the lowered sea level relative to that at the former inter-glacial sea level, about 1 degrees C at the Las Glacial Maximum, which reduces the discrepancies previously noted by others between terrestrial and marine estimates of sea-level cooling. The change in temperature is indicated by the product of the ELA or VBA lowering and the environmental lapse rate (ELR). Prior estimates of Delta ELA (-900 +/- 135 m) and ELR (-6 degrees +/- 0.1 degrees C km(-1)) would indicate a cooling of -5.4 degrees C at interglacial sea level and -4.4 degrees C at glacial sea level, although glacial-period ELRs are not known reliably.

A fluctuating, increasingly saline, terminal lake survived into the late Holocene until upstream water diversions to the Los Angeles Aqueduct began in 1913. Shoreline fragments and beach stratigraphy indicate that the lake reached its highest late Pleistocene level around 23.5 ka, during the Last Glacial Maximum, when it was fed by meltwaters from Sierra Nevada glaciers and spilled southward to Searles Lake and beyond. The lake then fell to relatively low levels after 16.5 ka before experiencing terminal Pleistocene oscillations related to hydroclimatic forcing, which involved changing regional precipitation regimes rather than major inputs from Sierra Nevada glaciers. Two major transgressions occurred. The first culminated around 14.3 ka and was probably related to a cooler, wetter regional climate. The second culminated around 12.8 ka and was linked to the earlier wetter phase of the Younger Dryas cold event. However, the high late Pleistocene shoreline is deformed, and the highest beach ranges in elevation from 1140 m to 1167 m above sea level. If the terminal Pleistocene lake overflowed, as suggested here, then its outlet has also been raised since 12.8 ka. This deformation appears to have involved uplift of the Coso Range magmatic complex relative to subsidence and faulting within the Owens Lake graben between the Sierra Nevada and Inyo Mountains frontal faults. Such deformation confounds simple hydroclimatic explanations of lake behavior and must be incorporated into models that seek to interpret the changing form and geochemistry of Owens Lake and the frequency of its spillage southward to Searles Lake.",2008,10.1130/2008.2439(09),Geology,WOS:000271219900009,Meghan,No,Yes,No,,,NA,,,,,,Courtney,No,,No,,Shana,No,,No,sierra nevada,

Of the 35 genera of now-extinct North American Pleistocene mammals, 19 are known to have occurred in the Great Basin, a list that is likely to be complete or nearly so. Of these 19, seven can be shown to have survived beyond 12,000 radiocarbon years ago, a proportion similar to that for North America as a whole. Horses, camels, mammoth, and helmeted musk-oxen appear to have been the most abundant of these genera. Pygmy rabbits (Brachylagus idahoensis), yellow-bellied marmots (Marmota flaviventris), and bushy-tailed woodrats (Neotoma cinerea) declined in abundance at the end of the Pleistocene, at about the same time as populations south of their current and western distributional boundary were extirpated. Subsequent declines occurred during the hot/dry middle Holocene. Pygmy rabbits also declined as modern pinyon-juniper woodlands developed across the Great Basin. The Snake Range of eastern Nevada has seen the late Pleistocene or Holocene extinction of both northern pocket gophers (Thomomys talpoides) and pikas (Ochotona princeps). Coupled with the rarity of yellow-bellied marmots here, these histories make the Snake Range a biogeographic oddity.

However, I investigated forest response to an extremely unusual disturbance event. Following heavy rain in June 1995 a catastrophic debris flow from Vimy Peak in the Canadian Rocky Mountains terminated as an alluvial debris fan that plowed through a trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) grove. I analyzed the site over a decade to monitor forest response and determine whether there would be recolonization to the prior forest type. In contrast to my expectation, aspen recolonization did not occur; instead, black cottonwoods (Populus trichocarpa Torr. & Gray) colonized the site. These originated from seedlings and not through clonal propagation, and by 2004, black cottonwoods composed 99% of the saplings and were typically 0.6-1.4 m tall with a density of about 1/m(2). The debris fan dramatically changed the physical environment, which partly resembled a floodplain depositional zone and was colonized by the regionally dominant riparian tree. I propose the concept of foreign disturbance to recognize an unusual disturbance that an organism would very rarely experience and thus to which it is unlikely to be adapted.

The DJM population, a northern outpost of pinyon, was established by long-distance dispersal (similar to 40 km). Growth of this isolate was markedly episodic and tracked multidecadal variability in precipitation. Initial colonization occurred by AD 1246, but expansion was forestalled by catastrophic drought (1250-1288), which we speculate produced extensive mortality of Utah Juniper (Juniperus osteospemia (Torr.)

With the development of airborne light detection and ranging (lidar) technologies with the capability to rapidly map large areas of topography at high resolutions, there is a need to assess the utility of this technology for glacier surface change detection and water resources assessment. The study presented here compares two lidar digital elevation models (DEMs) collected 23 months apart in 2000 and 2002 over Peyto Glacier, Canadian Rocky Mountains, for the purposes of intensity image feature recognition and surface downwasting assessment. The 2002 DEM was subtracted from the 2000 DEM to quantify the total and spatial variability in surface downwasting (or growth) within the glacial and periglacial environments. It was found that there was a reduction in volume totaling 33 x 10(6) m(3) over the Peyto Glacier surface and surrounding ice-cored moraines. This downwasting was estimated to be equivalent to approximately 22 x 106 m3 of water volume and, after extrapolation, 16% of total basin runoff. The water-equivalent contribution from ice-cored moraines was estimated to be 6% of the total glacier runoff contribution, highlighting the importance of monitoring this component of glacial melt.",2006,,Remote Sensing,WOS:000242450100015,Meghan,Maybe,No,No,individual,not enough discussion of climate change (mentions the word once in the abstract),NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Shana,No,,No,Northern Banff NP,

We have studied the evolution of an idealized glaciated valley during the period following retreat of ice using a numerical model. The model incorporates a stochastic process to represent deep-seated landsliding, non-linear diffusion to represent shallow landsliding and an approximation of the Bagnold relation to represent fluvial sediment transport. It was calibrated using field data from several recent surveys within British Columbia, Canada. We present ensemble model results and compare them with results from a deterministic linear-diffusion model to show that explicit representation of large landslides is necessary to reproduce the morphology and channel network structure of a typical postglacial valley. Our model predicts a rapid rate of fluvial sediment transport following deglaciation with a subsequent gradual decline, similar to that inferred for Holocene time.

Likewise, the concentrations of these nuclides in ancient sediments, stored in a depositional basin, carry a record of past erosion rates in the sediment source area. This is important because such a record could be compared to records of climate change or tectonic events to elucidate relationships between climate, tectonics and erosion. If the sediments are shielded from the cosmic-ray flux after deposition, for example in deep water, their nuclide concentrations need only be corrected for radioactive decay since deposition in order to determine past erosion rates. Where sediment is deposited subaerially and buried relatively slowly, on the other hand, the additional nuclide concentration that builds up during sediment accumulation and storage must be reconstructed and subtracted in order to recover the initial nuclide concentrations in the sediment and thence the past erosion rates. We describe an example of this process for an early to middle Pleistocene section of alluvial sediment in Fisher Valley, Utah. We use stratigraphic observations as well as an independently known age model for the sediment section to: (a) subtract post-depositional nuclide concentrations and reconstruct past erosion rates between 0.7 and 0.6 Ma; and (b) estimate the uncertainty in the results that arises from imperfect dating of the section and the natural variability in accumulation rates. The present basin-averaged erosion rate in Fisher Valley is near 125 m Ma(-1), and middle Pleistocene basin-averaged erosion rates varied between 80 and 220 m Ma(-1). Changes in the erosion rate over time do not appear to be connected to glacial-interglacial climate changes, but may be related to episodic subsidence of the basin. Uncertainties are small in the case of low erosion rates and high sediment accumulation rates, and large in the opposite situation. In this example, we could reduce the uncertainties by increasing the sampling density or by better relating our sample locations to the small-scale stratigraphy of the sedimentary section. In general, future attempts to reconstruct past erosion rates from cosmogenic-nuclide concentrations in ancient alluvium will be most successful in situations where post-depositional nuclide accumulation is minimized, for example in lakes or marine basins.

Our lichenometric investigations were preceded by the development of a locally calibrated Rhizocarpon geographicum growth curve (1708-1998 A.D.). Documentation of a 3-4-year ecesis interval for both trees and lichen greatly reduces one of the main uncertainties in using geobotanical methods for dating LIA landforms. The moraine dates provided, therefore, give a good approximation of the shift in climate conditions that lead to the retreat of the glaciers and subsequent moraine stabilization. Geobotanical evidence records three synchronous episodes of LIA moraine deposition at both glaciers: two prominent moraines at each site are dated to the early 1700s and late 1800s, with a third, smaller moraine dated to the mid 1930s. Moraines deposited prior to 1397 A.D. were also recorded at Colonel Foster Glacier; however, precise dating of these moraines was not possible. The moraine records from Strathcona Provincial Park suggest two possible modes of glacier response: (i) synchronous responses to larger-scale climatic forcing, and (ii) asynchronous responses to local factors such as microclimate, topography, and glacier geometry. The Vancouver Island LIA record was evaluated in the context of LIA results from the Pacific North American (PNA) Cordillera.

This paper analyzes the vulnerability of the Pyrenean ski resorts to projected changes in the snowpack under various future climate scenarios. In addition, the study analyzes the sustainability of the snowmaking systems to offset the climate variability of natural snow cover. On average, the study predicts a shorter ski-season length, especially in low-altitude ski resorts in a moderate climate change scenario and for all ski resorts in a more intensive climate change scenario. However, a significant regional variability has been identified for the projected impacts at very short geographical distances within the studied area.

In 2013, the exposed area of 18 small glaciers (from 0.02 to 0.88 km(2)) in the study area was 3.917 +/- 0.064 km(2), and volume similar to 255 x 10(6) m(3). Between the LIA maximum and 2013, the area has been decreased by 61 % with rate of 0.377 % a(-1).

Using regional climatic data we have found that climate conditions obviously stimulated glacier mass loss over the past at least 60 years. The increased variability of absolute and relative changes in 1995-2013 was due to influence of local factors on the overall climate-driven deglaciation trend.

Conversely, the response is asynchronous when the elevation ranges of vegetation types and associated vertebrates change in different directions. The capacity of vertebrate species to respond synchronously with change in the elevation ranges of the vegetation that comprises their habitat is likely a function of their ecological traits. Here we combine measures of elevation range shifts in 23 vertebrate species with those of their associated vegetation types across 80 yr, on a large elevation transect in California's Sierra Nevada mountains that encompasses Yosemite National Park. Half the species' shifts were synchronous with vegetation shifts, 1/4 of the species were asynchronous, and the others showed no relationship. Most species that responded synchronously to changes in vegetation elevation ranges expanded their elevation range, and are inhabitants of low and intermediate elevations. In contrast, those species whose range shifts were asynchronous to associated vegetation shifts inhabit high elevations. These species experienced contraction in elevation range even while their associated vegetation types expanded. However, these species were responding synchronously to a subset of their associated vegetation types. Considering trait-based predictors, omnivores were more synchronous than herbivores. Our results on synchronous and asynchronous elevation shifts with vegetation may permit more accurate modeling of future ranges for vertebrates in California's Sierra Nevada.

Conservation and/or expansion of riparian shade could counter warming and buy time for ecosystems to adapt. However, sensitivity of river reaches to direct solar radiation is highly heterogeneous in space and time, so benefits of shading are also expected to be site specific. We use a network of high-resolution temperature measurements from two upland rivers in the UK, in conjunction with topographic shade modeling, to assess the relative significance of landscape and riparian shade to the thermal behavior of river reaches. Trees occupy 7% of the study catchments (comparable with the UK national average) yet shade covers 52% of the area and is concentrated along river corridors. Riparian shade is most beneficial for managing Tw at distances 5-20 km downstream from the source of the rivers where discharge is modest, flow is dominated by near-surface hydrological pathways, there is a wide floodplain with little landscape shade, and where cumulative solar exposure times are sufficient to affect Tw. For the rivers studied, we find that approximately 0.5 km of complete shade is necessary to off-set Tw by 1 degrees C during July (the month with peak Tw) at a headwater site; whereas 1.1 km of shade is required 25 km downstream.

Resistance and resilience metrics were explicitly defined. Pre-harvest and two post-harvest measurements were used to assess how the different silvicultural treatments influenced the metrics. The shelterwood with reserves was the only treatment to meet both the resistance and resilience criteria. This treatment, while not traditionally used, created a stand structure and composition that will be most resilient to climate induced increases in spruce beetle caused tree mortality. However, there will be a trade-off in composition and structure, especially Engelmann spruce, after a spruce beetle epidemic because the created structure is more uniform with fewer groups and gaps than commonly observed in spruce-fir forests.

Geologically mediated drainage and storage properties, however, may strongly influence these relationships between climate and ET. We use a physically based process model to evaluate how plant accessible water storage capacity (AWC) and rates of drainage influence model estimates of ET-climate relationships for three snow-dominated, mountainous catchments with differing precipitation regimes. Model estimates show that total annual precipitation is a primary control on inter-annual variation in ET across all catchments and that the timing of recharge is a second-order control. Low AWC, however, increases the sensitivity of annual ET to these climate drivers by 3 to 5 times in our two study basins with drier summers. ET-climate relationships in our Colorado basin receiving summer precipitation are more stable across subsurface drainage and storage characteristics. Climate driver-ET relationships are most sensitive to subsurface storage (AWC) and drainage parameters related to lateral redistribution in the relatively dry Sierra site that receives little summer precipitation. Our results demonstrate that uncertainty in geophysically mediated storage and drainage properties can strongly influence model estimates of watershed-scale ET responses to climate variation and climate change. This sensitivity to uncertainty in geophysical properties is particularly true for sites receiving little summer precipitation. A parallel interpretation of this parameter sensitivity is that spatial variation in storage and drainage properties are likely to lead to substantial within-watershed plot-scale differences in forest water use and drought stress.",2015,10.5194/hess-19-4845-2015,Geology; Water Resources,WOS:000367243800008,Micah,No,Yes,No,,CA,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Shana,No,,No,CA,

Complex climatic interactions control hydrological processes in high mountains that in their turn regulate the erosive forces shaping the relief. To unravel the hydrological cycle of a glaciated watershed (Gunt River) considered representative of the Pamir Mountains' hydrologic regime, we developed a remotesensing-based approach. At the boundary between two distinct climatic zones dominated by the Westerlies and Indian summer monsoon, the Pamir Mountains are poorly instrumented and only a few in situ meteorological and hydrological data are available. We adapted a suitable conceptual distributed hydrological model (J2000g). Interpolations of the few available in situ data are inadequate due to strong, relief-induced, spatial heterogeneities. Instead of these we use raster data, preferably from remote sensing sources depending on availability and validation. We evaluate remote-sensing-based precipitation and temperature products. MODIS MOD11 surface temperatures show good agreement with in situ data, perform better than other products, and represent a good proxy for air temperatures. For precipitation we tested remote sensing products as well as the HAR10 climate model data and the interpolation-based APHRODITE data set. All products show substantial differences both in intensity and seasonal distribution with in situ data. Despite low resolutions, the data sets are able to sustain high model efficiencies (NSE >= 0.85). In contrast to neighbouring regions in the Himalayas or the Hindu Kush, discharge is dominantly the product of snow and glacier melt, and thus temperature is the essential controlling factor. Eighty percent of annual precipitation is provided as snow in winter and spring contrasting peak discharges during summer. Hence, precipitation and discharge are negatively correlated and display complex hysteresis effects that allow for the effect of interannual climatic variability on river flow to be inferred. We infer the existence of two subsurface reservoirs. The groundwater reservoir (providing 40% of annual discharge) recharges in spring and summer and releases slowly during autumn and winter, when it provides the only source for river discharge. A not fully constrained shallow reservoir with very rapid retention times buffers meltwaters during spring and summer. The negative glacier mass balance (-0.6 mw.e.yr(-1)) indicates glacier retreat, which will ultimately affect the currently 30% contribution of glacier melt to annual stream flow. The spatiotemporal dependence of water release from snow and ice during the annual cycle likewise implies spatiotemporally restricted surface processes, which are essentially confined to glaciated catchments in late summer, when glacier runoff is the only source of surface runoff. Only this precise constraint of the hydrologic cycle in this complex region allows for unravelling of the surface processes and natural hazards such as floods and landslides as well as water availability in the downstream areas. The proposed conceptual model has a tremendous importance for the understanding of the denudation processes in the region. In the Pamirs, large releases of running water that control erosion intensity are primarily controlled by temperature and the availability of snow and glaciers, thus making the region particularly sensitive to climatic variations.",2015,10.5194/esurf-3-333-2015,Physical Geography; Geology,WOS:000365625800004,Micah,No,No,No,,Pamir Mts.,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Shana,No,,No,Pamir Mts.,

We develop ecoregion-dependent regressions using observed relationships between annual total area burned and a suite of meteorological variables and fire weather indices, and apply these regressions to the simulated meteorology. We find that for Alaska and western Canada, almost all models predict significant (p < 0.05) increases in area burned at the mid-century, with median values ranging from 150 to 390 %, depending on the ecoregion. Such changes are attributed to the higher surface air temperatures and 500 hPa geopotential heights relative to present day, which together lead to favorable conditions for wildfire spread. Elsewhere the model predictions are not as robust. For the central and southern Canadian ecoregions, the models predict increases in area burned of 45-90 %. Except for the Taiga Plain, where area burned decreases by 50 %, no robust trends are found in northern Canada, due to the competing effects of hotter weather and wetter conditions there.

In the northwestern US states, local wildfire emissions at the mid-century enhance surface ozone by an average of 1 ppbv, while transport of boreal fire pollution further degrades ozone air quality by an additional 0.5 ppbv.

In the current study, fifty-four high-elevation lakes (754-2005 m a.s.l.) were studied to investigate the potential influence of climate change on surface water acid-sensitivity. Redundancy analysis indicated that the concentration of nitrate, dissolved organic carbon, and associated metals was significantly influenced by climate parameters. Furthermore, these components differed significantly between biogeoclimatic zones. Modelled soil base cation weathering for a subset of the study lakes (n = 11) was predicted to increase by 9% per 1 degrees C increase in temperature. Changes in temperature and precipitation may potentially decrease the pH of surface waters owing to changes in anthropogenic deposition and organic acid production. In contrast, increased soil base cation weathering may increase the critical load (of acidity) of high-elevation lakes. Ultimately, the determining factor will be whether enhanced base cation weathering is sufficient to buffer changes in natural and anthropogenic acidity.

The loss of rare species as a consequence of climate change could result in substantial reductions in biodiversity, especially in high-elevation systems. We investigated causes of range restriction by using the narrow alpine endemic Abronia alpina (Ramshaw Meadows sand verbena) as a case study. This study examined habitat suitability as a limiting factor for the establishment of Abronia alpina, an endemic native to only 2 meadow systems in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, Inyo National Forest,,California, USA. We tested habitat suitability by (a) using vegetation community composition and diversity as a proxy; (b) measuring key physical environmental characteristics (i.e., soil moisture, pH, soil texture, and surface soil temperature); and (c) establishing experimental field and greenhouse germination tests that exposed seeds to soils from several potentially suitable meadows. These 10 apparently suitable meadow systems were compared to the currently occupied meadow. Our results suggest that though there is some difference in suitable habitat among the 10 meadows studied, most meadows are relatively similar, for the rest of the measured parameters, to the native meadow. Vegetation community composition in the occupied meadow differed significantly from 8 of the surveyed meadows but was similar to 2 meadows. However, species diversity and richness in the native meadow did not generally differ from other surveyed meadows. Seven of 10 meadows were significantly colder than the occupied meadow, but 3 meadows with similar elevation ranges were equivalent. Range restriction does not appear to be a result of physical soil conditions, but cooler minimum temperatures may play a role. Although seeds only germinated in 2 of the tested meadows in field trials, dispersal limitation may be important in the species' restricted range, as seed germination was not significantly different among any meadow soils. Thus, nonhabitat factors, such as seed dispersal or recent speciation, may be the cause for the narrow range of A. alpina. Given stable climatic conditions, we recommend 3 meadow systems for establishment if recent population declines continue and relocation is deemed necessary. We also identify 7 other meadows that may be suitable, given a changing climate.",2014,,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WOS:000344413500004,Micah,No,Maybe,No,,CA,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Shana,No,,No,CA,

Furthermore, we related these changes to an observed increase in air temperature and decrease in river flow over the last 40 years. Overall, caddisfly species richness increased but patterns varied depending on altitude in a non-linear shape. Richness increased in altitude with maximum values at sites of intermediate-high altitude (1800-2000 m). The effects of the observed climate change may be explained by the colonization of headwaters and middle reaches from mid-lowland species or by those from streams and rivers in nearby mountain chains at lower altitude.

Microscopy, spectroscopy, diffraction, and aqueous chemistry measurements were integrated to determine the chemical composition of wood ash and its effect on water chemistry. Climate change has caused dramatic impacts and stresses that have resulted in large-scale increases in wildfire activity in semi-arid areas of the world. Metals and other constituents associated with wildfire ash can be transported by storm event runoff and negatively affect the water quality in streams and rivers. Differences among ash from six tree species based on total concentrations of metals such as Ca, Al, Mg, Fe, and Mn were identified using non-metric multidimensional analysis. Metal-bearing carbonate and oxide phases were quantified by X-ray diffraction analyses and X-ray spectroscopy analyses. These metal-bearing carbonate phases were readily dissolved in the first 30 minutes of reaction with 18 MU water and 10 mM HCO3- in laboratory batch experiments which resulted in the release of metals and carbonates in the ash, causing water alkalinity to increase. However, metal concentrations decreased over the course of the experiment, suggesting that metals re-adsorb to ash. Our results suggest that the dissolution of metal-bearing carbonate and oxide phases in ash and metal re-adsorption to ash are relevant processes affecting water chemistry after wildfire events.

This paper presents the modeling results of meltwater runoff in the Juntanghu River basin, where the river flow is dominated by glacier and snow meltwater from above the mid-altitude of the north central Tian Shan Mountains in Northwest China. The soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) model is used to assess the effects of potential climate change on the Juntanghu River basin. The model uses meteorological data, which include precipitation, temperature, wind, and solar radiation, to depict the impact of climate change on the river discharge in the Juntanghu watershed. The SWAT model is validated and verified against the observed discharge at the Hongshan reservoir at the outlet of the watershed from 1995 to 2010. The SWAT model can well differentiate between meltwater runoff from snow and that from glaciers in the basin. The R2 and Nash-Sutcliffe simulation efficiency values computed for the daily comparisons are 0.92 and 0.85 for the calibration period and 0.83 and 0.81 for the validation period, respectively. Experiments show that the hydrological cycle in the Juntanghu River basin may be altered under changing climatic scenarios. The mean annual stream flow changes in response to climate change projections are simulated using SWAT model. A rising mean temperature (T + 1 degrees C) in early spring results in a 2.14 times increase in the average daily stream flow (on February 27), whereas a higher rising temperature (T + 3 degrees C) results in an earlier snowmelt phenomenon. However, the snowmelt runoff from the preliminary to interim stages has less influence in relation to changes in the precipitation. The average daily flow changes of 1.07 times are predicted for precipitation change scenarios of 10%. The climate change scenarios show a large degree of uncertainty in terms of current climate change forecasts for the Juntanghu basin. The simulated Juntanghu hydrological cycle is also very sensitive to current forecasted climate changes under climate change conditions.",2016,,Engineering; Water Resources,WOS:000386009900003,Paris,No,Yes,No,,China,Adrienne,No,Maybe,No,,,NA,,,,,Shana,No,,International,China,

The long-lived bristlecone pine (Pinus longaeva D. K. Bailey) is a foundation treeline species in the Great Basin of North America reaching stem ages of about 5000 years. We investigated stem cambial phenology and radial size variability to quantify the relative influence of environmental variables on bristlecone pine growth. Repeated cellular measurements and half-hourly dendrometer records were obtained during 2013 and 2014 for two high-elevation stands included in the Nevada Climate-ecohydrological Assessment Network. Daily time series of stem radial variations showed rehydration and expansion starting in late April-early May, prior to the onset of wood formation at breast height. Formation of new xylem started in June and lasted until mid-September. There were no differences in phenological timing between the two stands, or in the air and soil temperature thresholds for the onset of xylogenesis. A multiple logistic regression model highlighted a separate effect of air and soil temperature on xylogenesis, the relevance of which was modulated by the interaction with vapor pressure and soil water content. While air temperature plays a key role in cambial resumption after winter dormancy, soil thermal conditions coupled with snowpack dynamics also influence the onset of wood formation by regulating plant-soil water exchanges. Our results help build a physiological understanding of climate-growth relationships in P. longaeva, the importance of which for dendroclimatic reconstructions can hardly be overstated.

Wetland changes correlate with monsoon intensity changes identified in nearby records, with weak monsoon intervals corresponding to desiccation and erosion of wetlands.

The margins of a species' range might often correspond with anomalous microclimates that confer habitat suitability where the species would otherwise fail to persist. We addressed this hypothesis using data from an interior, climatic range margin of the American pika (Ochotona princeps), an indicator of relatively cool, mesic climates in rocky habitats of western North America. Pikas in Lava Beds National Monument, northeastern California, USA, occur at elevations much lower than predicted by latitude and longitude. We hypothesized that pika occurrence within Lava Beds would be associated primarily with features such as ""ice caves"" in which sub-surface ice persists outside the winter months. We used data loggers to monitor sub-surface temperatures at cave entrances and at non-cave sites, confirming that temperatures were cooler and more stable at cave entrances. We surveyed habitat characteristics and evidence of pika occupancy across a random sample of cave and non-cave sites over a 2-yr period. Pika detection probability was high (similar to 0.97), and the combined occupancy of cave and non-cave sites varied across the 2 yr from 27% to 69%. Contrary to our hypothesis, occupancy was not higher at cave sites. Vegetation metrics were the best predictors of site use by pikas, followed by an edge effect and elevation. The importance of vegetation as a predictor of pika distribution at this interior range margin is congruent with recent studies from other portions of the species' range. However, we caution that vegetation composition depends on microclimate, which might be the proximal driver of pika distribution. The microclimates available in non-cave crevices accessible to small animals have not been characterized adequately for lava landscapes. We advocate innovation in the acquisition and use of microclimatic data for understanding the distributions of many taxa.

The goal of this study is to investigate patterns of and potential mechanisms in post-outbreak forest change in order to better understand the ecological legacy of the recent outbreak in the context of its implications for resilience to future disturbances and adaptation to climate change. To this end, we collected field data on forest structure and species composition in 2012 in lodgepole pine dominant forests in Rocky Mountain National Park. We then used a combination of modeling and statistical methods to identify possible mechanisms in post outbreak forest conditions and evaluate the effect of the MPB outbreak on forest heterogeneity. We found that the outbreak initiated a shift in forest structure from single-cohort lodgepole pine stands to stands with greater diversity in age classes and species composition. This increase in landscape asynchrony may increase resiliency to future disturbances. However, this heterogeneity is a result of more spruce and fir on the landscape, species which are less adapted to projected future climate conditions. Our results indicate that disturbances do not necessarily increase the rate at which vegetation adapts to a changing climate, and that it is essential to consider disturbance type and available seed sources when predicting future forest conditions.

Variation of forest C density is especially pronounced in mountainous terrain, where environmental gradients are compressed and vary at multiple spatial scales. Additionally, the influence of environmental gradients may vary with forest age and developmental stage, an important consideration as forest landscapes often have a diversity of stand ages from past management and other disturbance agents. Quantifying forest C density and its underlying environmental determinants in mountain terrain has remained challenging because many available data sources lack the spatial grain and ecological resolution needed at both stand and landscape scales. The objective of this study was to determine if environmental factors influencing aboveground live carbon (ALC) density differed between young versus old forests. We integrated aerial light detection and ranging (lidar) data with 702 field plots to map forest ALC density at a grain of 25 m across the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest, a 6369 ha watershed in the Cascade Mountains of Oregon, USA. We used linear regressions, random forest ensemble learning (RF) and sequential autoregressive modeling (SAR) to reveal how mapped forest ALC density was related to climate, topography, soils, and past disturbance history (timber harvesting and wildfires). ALC increased with stand age in young managed forests, with much greater variation of ALC in relation to years since wildfire in old unmanaged forests. Timber harvesting was the most important driver of ALC across the entire watershed, despite occurring on only 23% of the landscape. More variation in forest ALC density was explained in models of young managed forests than in models of old unmanaged forests. Besides stand age, ALC density in young managed forests was driven by factors influencing site productivity, whereas variation in ALC density in old unmanaged forests was also affected by finer scale topographic conditions associated with sheltered sites. Past wildfires only had a small influence on current ALC density, which may be a result of long times since fire and/or prevalence of non-stand replacing fire. Our results indicate that forest ALC density depends on a suite of multi-scale environmental drivers mediated by complex mountain topography, and that these relationships are dependent on stand age. The high and context-dependent spatial variability of forest ALC density has implications for quantifying forest carbon stores, establishing upper bounds of potential carbon sequestration, and scaling field data to landscape and regional scales.

When thicker than a few centimeters, surface debris suppresses melt rates. If continuous debris cover is present, ablation rates can be significantly reduced leading to increases in glacier length. In order to quantify feedbacks in the debris-glacier-climate system, we developed a 2-D long-valley numerical glacier model that includes englacial and supraglacial debris advection. We ran 120 simulations on a linear bed profile in which a hypothetical steady state debris-free glacier responds to a step increase of surface debris deposition. Simulated glaciers advance to steady states in which ice accumulation equals ice ablation, and debris input equals debris loss from the glacier terminus. Our model and parameter selections can produce 2-fold increases in glacier length. Debris flux onto the glacier and the relationship between debris thickness and melt rate strongly control glacier length. Debris deposited near the equilibrium-line altitude, where ice discharge is high, results in the greatest glacier extension when other debris-related variables are held constant. Debris deposited near the equilibrium-line altitude re-emerges high in the ablation zone and therefore impacts melt rate over a greater fraction of the glacier surface. Continuous debris cover reduces ice discharge gradients, ice thickness gradients, and velocity gradients relative to initial debris-free glaciers. Debris-forced glacier extension decreases the ratio of accumulation zone to total glacier area (AAR). Our simulations reproduce the 'general trends' between debris cover, AARs, and glacier surface velocity patterns from modern debris-covered glaciers. We provide a quantitative, theoretical foundation to interpret the effect of debris cover on the moraine record, and to assess the effects of climate change on debris-covered glaciers.",2016,10.5194/tc-10-1105-2016,Physical Geography; Geology,WOS:000379415500011,Paris,,,No,,Himalaya,Danny,No,Yes,No,,Model,NA,,,,,Shana,No,,International,Himalaya,

Over longer timescales, climate change may alter fire regimes; thus, we used fire-related alluvial deposits to assess the timing of moderate- to high-severity fires, their geomorphic impact, and relation to climate over the last 4000 yr. Fire-related sedimentation does not clearly follow millennial-scale climatic changes, but probability peaks commonly correspond with severe drought, e.g., within the interval 1700-1400 cal yr BP, and ca. 650 and ca. 410 cal yr BP. The latter episodes were preceded by prolonged wet intervals that could promote dense stands. Estimated recurrence intervals for fire-related sedimentation are 250-400 yr. Climatic differences with aspect influenced Holocene post-fire response: fire-related deposits constitute 77% of fan sediments from north facing basins but only 39% of deposits from drier southerly aspects. With sparser vegetation and exposed bedrock, south aspects can generate runoff and sediment when unburned, whereas soil-mantled north aspects produce minor sediment unless severely burned. Recent channel incision appears unprecedented over the last 2300 yr, suggesting that fuel loading and extreme drought produced an anomalously severe burn in 2002. (C) 2015 University of Washington.

The entire digitized record of USGS instantaneous discharge data is used for all stream gauging stations with over 10 years of data. Using the 1 m(3) s(-1) km(-2) threshold, the flashiest basins in the contiguous United States are located in urban areas along a swath of states from the south-central United States to the mid-Atlantic and in mountainous areas of the West Coast, especially the Pacific Northwest. The authors focus on small watersheds to identify the flashiest cities and states across the country and find Tulsa, Oklahoma; Baltimore, Maryland; and St. Louis, Missouri, to be the flashiest cities in the contiguous United States. Thunderstorms are major agents for peak-over-threshold flood events east of the Rocky Mountains, and tropical cyclones play a secondary role, especially in the Southeast. West Coast flood events are associated with winter storms. Flooding west of and within the Rockies is linked to steeply sloped terrain and compact watersheds. East of the Rockies, urban areas dominate flashy watersheds. The authors find that watersheds northeast (downwind) of city centers are flashier than other urban watersheds, consistent with the downwind maximum in rainfall found in many urban regions. They examine anomalous flood response in the Illinois-Missouri region; St. Louis is among the flashiest cities in the United States, while Chicago is among the least flashy.

We directly and continuously measured precipitation and evapotranspiration (ET) from both subalpine forest and alpine tundra portions of a single catchment, as well as discharge fluxes at the catchment outlet, to quantify the water balance of a mountainous, headwater catchment in Colorado, USA. Between 2008 and 2012, the water balance closure averaged 90% annually, and the catchment ET was the largest water output at 66% of precipitation. Alpine ET was greatest during the winter, in part because of sublimation from blowing snow, which contributed from 27% to 48% of the alpine, and 6% to 9% of the catchment water balance, respectively. The subalpine ET peaked in summer. Alpine areas generated the majority of the catchment discharge, despite covering only 31% of the catchment area. Although the average annual alpine runoff efficiency (discharge/precipitation; 40%) was greater than the subalpine runoff efficiency (19%), the subalpine runoff efficiency was more sensitive to changes in precipitation. Inter-annual analysis of the evaporative and dryness indices revealed persistent moisture limitations at the catchment scale, although the alpine alternated between energy-limited and water-limited states in wet and dry years. Each ecosystem generally over-generated discharge relative to that expected from a Budyko-type model. The alpine and catchment water yields were relatively unaffected by annual meteorological variability, but this interpretation was dependent on the method used to quantify potential ET. Our results indicate that correctly accounting for dissimilar hydrological cycling above and below alpine treeline is critical to quantify the water balance of high-elevation mountain catchments over periods of meteorological variability.

A synchronous pulse at all ecotones occurred between 1963 and 2000 (limber pine) and between 1955 and 1978 (bristlecone pine) when pines expanded 225 m beyond forest borders. Little recruitment occurred before this interval or in the 21st century. No obvious environmental factors distinguished recruitment locations from nonrecruitment locations. Where their ranges overlap, limber pine has leapfrogged above bristlecone pine by 300 m. Limber pine tree-ring chronologies, developed to compare radial-growth responses with recruitment, showed dominant pulses of increased growth during the same interval as recruitment. Significant climate correlations of growth and recruitment indicated lead and lag effects as much as 6 years and complex relationships with climate variables, corroborating the importance of cumulative climate effects relative to any single year. Water relations were the most important drivers of growth and recruitment and interacted with growing-season minimum and maximum temperatures.

Here, the SAF is characterized and quantified over the complex terrain of the Colorado Headwaters region using high-resolution regional climate model simulations. A pair of 7-yr control and pseudo-global warming simulations is used to study the regional climate response to a large-scale thermodynamic climate perturbation. Warming is strongly enhanced in regions of snow loss by as much as 5 degrees C. Linear feedback analysis is used to quantify the strength of the SAF within the Headwaters region. The strength of the SAF reaches a maximum value of 4 W m(-2) K-1 during April when snow loss coincides with strong incoming solar radiation. Simulations using 4- and 12-km horizontal grid spacing show good agreement in the strength and timing of the SAF, whereas a 36-km simulation shows discrepancies that are tied to differences in snow accumulation and ablation caused by smoother terrain. Energy budget analysis shows that transport by atmospheric circulations acts as a negative feedback to regional warming, damping the effects of the SAF. On the mesoscale, the SAF nonlocally enhances warming in locations with no snow, and enhances snowmelt in locations that do not experience snow cover change. The methods presented here can be used generally to quantify the role of the SAF in simulated regional climate change, illuminating the causes of differences in climate warming between models and regions.",2015,10.1175/JCLI-D-15-0166.1,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,WOS:000361891300009,Paris,No,Yes,No,,CO,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Shana,No,,No,CO,

We analyzed the spatial distribution and recent temporal development of high-mountain lakes in a study area of 6139 km(2), covering the central European Alps over most of the province of Tyrol and part of the province of Salzburg in western Austria. We identified 1024 natural lakes. While eight lakes are ice-dammed, one-third of all lakes are located in the immediate vicinity of recent glacier tongues, half of them impounded by moraines, half by bedrock. Two-thirds of all lakes are apparently related to LIA or earlier glaciations. One landslide-dammed lake was identified in the study area. The evolution of nine selected (pro)glacial lakes was analyzed in detail, using multitemporal remotely sensed images and field reconnaissance. Considerable glacier retreat led to significant lake growth at four localities, two lakes experienced stagnant or slightly negative areal trends, one lake experienced a more significant negative areal trend, and two lakes drained completely during the investigation period. We further (i) analyzed the susceptibility of selected lakes to glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs), using two different methods; (ii) identified potential triggers and mechanisms of GLOFs; (iii) calculated possible flood magnitudes for predefined flood scenarios for a subset of the lakes; and (iv) delineated potentially impacted areas. We distinguished three phases of development of bedrock-dammed lakes: (a) a proglacial, (b) a glacier-detached, and (c) a nonglacial phase. The dynamics and also the susceptibility of a lake to GLOFs decrease substantially from (a) to (c). lakes in the stages (a). and (b) are less prominent in our study area, compared to other glacierized high-mountain regions, leading us to the conclusion that (i) the current threat to the population by GLOFs is lower but (ii) the future development of emerging lakes has to be monitored carefully.

Modern sediments in eight comparator lakes from across Wyoming and Colorado facilitate the stratigraphic interpretation by showing that littoral sediments have exponentially higher sand content, lower loss-on-ignition (LOI), and lower net accumulation rates than off-shore sediments. Sand layers in two near-shore cores from UBC share the characteristics of the modern littoral sediments (>80% sand, <5% LOI, and <10 cm/ka accumulation rates), and indicate that UBC was >1.9 m below its outlet from 12,500 to 11,300 and from 7500 to 2100 cal yr BP. Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) profiles consistent with the low-water episodes show correlative sand layers and submerged wave-cut scarps around the lake margin. The stratigraphic features correlate with those formed in the comparator lakes during extensive droughts at >11,300, 6900-6000, and 4800-3400 cal yr BP as well as a series of north-south anti-phased droughts between 5800 and 1200 cal yr BP.

Due to the uncertainty of projections in future climate, a new range of potential climatological future temperature shifts and precipitation ratios is applied to the Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting Model and Anderson Snow Model in order to determine hydrologic sensitivities. Two general circulation models (GCMs) were used in this analysis: one that is warm and wet (HadCM2 run 1) and one that is cool and dry (PCM run B06.06), relative to the GCM projections for California that were part of the Third Assessment Report of the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change. A set of specified incremental temperature shifts from 1.5degreesC to 5.0degreesC and precipitation ratios from 0.70 to 1.30 were also used as input to the snow and soil moisture accounting models, providing for additional scenarios (e.g., warm/dry, cool/wet). Hydrologic calculations were performed for a set of California river basins that extend from the coastal mountains and Sierra Nevada northern region to the southern Sierra Nevada region; these were applied to a water allocation analysis in a companion paper. Results indicate that for all snow-producing cases, a larger proportion of the streamflow volume will occur earlier in the year. The amount and timing is dependent on the characteristics of each basin, particularly the elevation. Increased temperatures lead to a higher freezing line, therefore less snow accumulation and increased melting below the freezing height. The hydrologic response varies for each scenario, and the resulting solution set provides bounds to the range of possible change in streamflow, snowmelt, snow water equivalent, and the change in the magnitude of annual high flows. An important result that appears for all snowmelt driven runoff basins, is that late winter snow accumulation decreases by 50 percent toward the end of this century.",2003,10.1111/j.1752-1688.2003.tb04404.x,Engineering; Geology; Water Resources,WOS:000184971100003,Shana,No,Yes,No,,California,NA,,,,,,Becky,No,No,No,California and Sierra Nevadas,Shana,No,,No,California,

Detrital erosion rates can be increased both by increased relief in the drainage basin and by a change to more seasonal rainfall patterns. The geologic record provides no clear answer to the question whether uplift caused the climatic deterioration of the Neogene or whether the changing climate affected the erosion system in such a way as to create an illusion of uplift.

Analysis of a high-resolution (10-m-grid) DEM transect across the convergent orogen of the Olympic Mountains reveals a non-linear relation between long-term erosion rates and mean slope, similar to a model for hillslope evolution by landsliding in steep terrain. The DEM data also reveal a relation between mean slope and mean local relief. Coarser-scale (1-km-grid) global analysis of the relation between erosion rate and mean local relief reveals different trends for areas with low erosion rates and tectonically active mountain ranges, with the composite relation being well-described by non-linear models. Together these analyses support the emerging view that erosion rates adjust to high rates of tectonically driven rock uplift primarily through changes in the frequency of landsliding rather than hillslope steepness, and imply that changes in local relief play a minor role in controlling landscape-scale erosion rates in tectonically active mountain ranges.

Transfer functions were determined by using data collected from four seasonal snowpacks (1989-1990, 19971998, 1998-1999, and 1999-2000). The timing and amount of each storm was determined from an automated snowpack telemetry (SNOTEL) site, 22 km northeast of UFG, and similar to 1060 m in elevation below UFG. Statistically significant and positive correlations between delta(18)O values in the snow and T(A) were consistently found in three of the four seasonal snowpacks. The snowpack with the poor correlation was deposited in 1997-1998 during the 1997-1998 El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). An ultrasonic snow-depth sensor installed on UFG provided valuable insights into site-specific storms and postdepositional processes that occur on UFG. The timing of storms recorded at the UFG and Cold Springs SNOTEL sites were similar; however, selected storms did not correlate. Snow from storms occurring after mid-October and followed by high winds was most susceptible to redeposition of snow. This removal of lower temperature snowfall could potentially bias the delta(18)O values preserved in ice core records to environmental conditions reflecting higher air temperatures and lower wind speeds. Transfer functions derived from seasonal snow cover on UFG were used to reconstruct T(A) values from delta(18)O values determined from two ice cores collected from UFG. Reconstructed air temperatures from the ice core data indicate an increase in T(A) of similar to3.5degreesC from the mid-1960s to the early 1990s in the alpine areas of northwestern Wyoming. Reconstructed T(A) from the ice core records between the end of the Little Ice Age (LIA), mid-1800s, and the early 1990s indicate a T(A) increase of similar to5degreesC. The historically reconstructed T(A) values from the UFG were significantly higher than the global average observed during the 20th Century but were in agreement with T(A) increases observed at selected, high-altitude and high-latitude sites in other parts of the world. Additional research is required to determine if part of the observed trend toward heavier delta(18)O values in ice from the UFG since the LIA (and increased TA) is due to an increased proportion of snowfall from southerly storm tracks and moisture sources, as seems to have been the situation in 1997-1998.",2002,10.1029/2001JD000621,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,WOS:000178977100014,Shana,No,Yes,No,,"Fremont, WY",NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Shana,No,,No,"Fremont, WY",

In 1996 five sediment cores, between 35 and 45 cm long, were collected from the deepest part of the lake and analysed to reconstruct environmental changes over the last few centuries. The data indicate changes induced by pollution and climate change during the last two centuries similar to those in other European mountain and remote lakes. However, at this site earthquakes have also affected the lake and partly obscure the interpretation of the sediment record. From 1780 to 1890, sediment records show low abundance of diatoms and relatively high abundance of Cladocera. After 1890, the number of diatoms started to increase coinciding with a strong earthquake. From the beginning of the 20th century, concentrations of spheroidal carbonaceous particles (SCP), diatom valves and head capsules of chironomids gradually increased whilst in Cladocera the main difference observed was a change in the proportion of benthic taxa.

We developed two analytical procedures to separate the effects of soil temperature and moisture, based on continuous measurements of the CO2 efflux, temperature and moisture of the soil at a ponderosa pine plantation in the Sierra Nevada Mountains in California, from May 1998 to August 1999. We found that the combined effects of temperature and moisture on the seasonal variation of soil CO2 efflux could be effectively separated and represented with the product of a temperature term and a moisture term. The relationship between soil CO2 efflux and temperature could be well described using a power function. This relationship was modified by soil moisture which affects only the coefficient, but not the exponent, of the power function. We also found that when soil moisture was held constant, the temperature effect explained 82% of the temporal variation in CO2 efflux of the soil. Similarly, when temperature was held constant, the moisture effects explained 84% of the variation. Temperature and moisture together explained 89% of the total temporal variations in soil CO2 efflux. A multiplicative formulation with power functions representing both temperature and moisture dependences was recommended for modeling soil CO2 efflux. This formulation can be used to model the seasonal trend of soil CO2 efflux of the forest based on temperature and moisture, two key variables influenced by climate change and management practices.",2001,10.1023/A:1013368800287,Agriculture; Plant Sciences,WOS:000172861900002,Shana,No,Yes,No,,Sierra Nevada,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Shana,No,,No,Sierra Nevada,

The SSPM represents the last remaining mixed-conifer forest along the Pacific coast still subject to uncontrolled, periodic ground fire. Location The SSPM is a north-south trending fault bound range, centred on 31 degrees N latitude, 100 km SE of Ensenada, Baja California. Methods We surveyed forests for composition, population structure, and historical dynamics both spatially and temporally over the past 65 years using repeat aerial photographs and ground sampling. Fire perimeter history was reconstructed based on time-series aerial photographs dating from 1942 to 1991 and interpretable back to 1925. A total of 256 1-ha sites randomly selected from aerial photographs were examined along a chronosequence for density and cover of canopy trees, density of snags and downed logs, and cover of non-conifer trees and shrubs. Twenty-four stands were sampled on-the-ground by a point-centred quarter method which yielded data on tree density, basal area, frequency, importance value, and shrub and herb cover. Results Forests experience moderately intense understory fires that range in size to 6400 ha, as well as numerous smaller, low intensity burns with low cumulative spatial extent. SSPM forests average 25-45% cover and 65-145 trees per ha. Sapling densities were two to three times that of overstory trees. Size-age distributions of trees greater than or equal to 4 cm dbh indicate multi-age stands with steady-state dynamics. Stands are similar to Californian mixed conifer forests prior to the imposition of fire suppression policy. Livestock grazing does not appear to be suppressing conifer regeneration. Main conclusions Our spatially-based reconstruction shows the open forest structure in SSPM to be a product of infrequent, intense surface fires with fire rotation periods of 52 years, rather than frequent, low intensity fires at intervals of 4-20 years proposed from California fire-scar dendrochronology (FSD) studies. Ground fires in SSPM were intense enough to kill pole-size trees and a significant number of overstory trees. We attribute long fire intervals to the gradual build-up of subcontinuous shrub cover, conifer recruitment and litter accumulation. Differences from photo interpretation and FSD estimates are due to assumptions made with respect to site-based (point) sampling of fire, and nonfractal fire intensities along fire size frequency distributions. Fire return intervals determined by FSD give undue importance to local burns which collectively use up little fuel, cover little area, and have little demographic impact on forests.",2000,10.1046/j.1365-2699.2000.00368.x,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Physical Geography,WOS:000088109600015,Shana,No,Yes,No,,California,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Shana,No,,No,California,

This shift is synchronous with a period of cooling in the North Atlantic that: may have triggered a period of drought in the south-western United States. Coinciding with this vegetation change, geomorphic evidence in Rio Grande, piedmont, and basin floor eolian environments indicates a major period of erosion. Subsequent gradual enrichment of pedogenic carbonate delta(13)C values in younger deposits suggests that C(4) grasses rebounded in the late Holocene (approximately 4 ka), which is consistent with other evidence of increased moisture regionally. A period of less severe aridity at approximately 2.2 ka is indicated by erosion and subsequent deposition along the alluvial fans and within the basin, and correlates with depleted pedogenic carbonate delta(13)C values suggesting a decrease in C(4) grasses.

We found a strong linear elevational component to monthly SWE accumulation trends. Below 2400 m, less snow is accumulating and it is melting earlier.

A subalpine forest was present at Little Lake, central Coast Range, between 15,700 and 14,850 cal yr B.P. A warm period between 14,850 and 14,500 cal yr B.P. is suggested by an increase in Pseudotsuga pollen and charcoal. The recurrence of subalpine forest at 14,500 cal yr B.P. implies a return to cool conditions. Another warming trend is evidenced by the reestablishment of Pseudotsuga forest at 14,250 cal yr B.P. Increased haploxylon Pinus pollen between 12,400 and 11,000 cal yr B.P. indicates cooler winters than before. After 11,000 cal yr B.P. warm dry conditions are implied by the expansion of Pseudotsuga. A subalpine parkland occupied Gordon Lake, western Cascade Range, until 14,500 cal yr B.P., when it was replaced during a warming trend by a montane forest. A rise in Pinus pollen from 12,800 to 11,000 cal yr B.P. suggests increased summer aridity. Pseudotsuga dominated the vegetation after 11,000 cal yr B.P. Other records from the Pacific Northwest show an expansion of Pinus from ca. 13,000 to 11,000 cal yr B.P.

A dendroecological analysis of subalpine fir across a range of elevations (1350-1850 m) and annual precipitation (125-350 cm y(-1)), was used to compare environmental factors affecting growth. Climate-growth relationships were explored using Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients; partial correlation analysis was used to assess relationships among site chronologies and climatic variables. Radial growth is negatively correlated with winter precipitation at high elevation and wet sites, but not at low and middle elevation dry sites. Growth is positively correlated with current growing season temperature at all sites; however, growth is negatively correlated with previous year August temperature, indicating that climate affects growth in subsequent years. Positive correlations between growth and summer precipitation during the growing season at low and middle elevation dry sites suggest that soil moisture is partially limiting to growth on these sites. If the climate of the Pacific Northwest becomes warmer and drier, then subalpine fir growth may increase at high elevation and wet sites, but may decrease at lower elevation dry sites in the Olympic Mountains. However, the growth response of subalpine fir to potentially rapid climate change will not be uniform because subalpine fir grows over a wide range of topographic features, habitats, and local climates at different geographical scales. A comparison of growth response to current growing season temperature suggests that the temperature-related growth response of subalpine fir is not adequately described by the parabolic curve used in JABOWA-based models.",1995,10.1111/j.1365-2486.1995.tb00023.x,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WOS:A1995TF59000007,Shana,No,,No,,Olympic Mtns,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Shana,No,,No,Olympic Mtns,

Analysis of treeline annual growth at a site in the southern Sierra Nevada, California, indicates that much of the past climate variability on timescales of centuries to millennia during the Holocene may be attributed to periodic changes in solar irradiance. Analysis of treeline-altitude variation in the Sierra Nevada and White Mountains of California suggests that this periodic change is superimposed on a generally decreasing temperature trend over the past 5000 years. This has led to a general stepped decrease in treeline altitude in both areas with treeline falling significantly following downturns in reconstructed solar activity levels and stabilizing rather than rising during upturns in solar activity. Treeline-altitude decrease generally lags changes in solar radiation by 400 to 500 years, suggesting that the change in climatic conditions that produces downward movement of treeline is sufficient to terminate most reproduction at the existing treeline but not severe enough to terminate growth. As such, this suggests that recovery of climate-change information from altitude change at slow-growing upper treeline sites may be complicated because of growth inertia.",1994,,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Physical Geography; Geology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,WOS:A1994PQ06400004,Shana,No,,No,,Sierra Nevada,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Shana,No,,No,Sierra Nevada,

Given the dramatic shifts in climate during the Pleistocene, it is not surprising that the Holocene was viewed as a time of benign climate. Holocene climate variability was first recognized around the middle of the century when paleoecologists found evidence that the early part of the epoch was warmer and drier than the later part. In 1970s and 1980s, another generation of geologists, geographers, and botanists began to recognize more complexity in Holocene climate and vegetation in western Canada. Several millennial-scale glacier ""advances"" postdating the early Holocene warm interval were defined, including the Garibaldi Phase (6.9-5.6 ka), the Tiedemann-Peyto Advance (3.5-1.9 ka), and the Little Ice Age (AD 1200-1900). Subsequently, application of dendrochronological techniques and stratigraphic studies in glacier forefields showed that the Little Ice Age was itself more complex than previously thought. During that 700-year period, glaciers repeatedly advanced and retreated in response to climatic variability on time scales ranging from centuries to decades. Recent work shows that the glacier record of the Garibaldi Phase and the Tiedemann and Peyto advances are similar in complexity to the Little Ice Age, with multiple advances of glaciers separated by intervals of more restricted ice cover. Researchers have also identified other times in the Holocene when glaciers expanded from restricted positions - 8.20, 4.90-3.80, and 1.70-1.40 ka. Continued research undoubtedly will reveal additional complexities, but with what is currently known the appropriateness of terms such as ""Tiedemann Advance Peyto Advance,"" and ""Little Ice Age"" can be questioned. Only short periods of time separate these episodes as currently defined, and it seems likely that intervals of restricted glacier cover within each of these millennial-length intervals are just as long as the intervals separating them.

Therefore, the delta(18)O value of phosphate from fossil tooth enamel can be used to infer the delta(18)O value of these reservoirs in the past. In this paper, tooth enamel from a semiaquatic mammal taxon (Coryphodon) collected from five early Eocene localities in North America is used to construct patterns in delta(18)O values of river water for this time period. At all localities, the delta(18)O value of river water (delta(18)O(r)) is estimated to have been higher during the early Eocene relative to present-day North American rivers, although the delta(18)O vs. latitude gradient was shallower during the Eocene. Higher delta(18)O(r) values are consistent with warmer Eocene air masses being able to hold more water vapor and with an increase in the poleward transport of both moisture and latent heat. The regular decrease in delta(18)O(r) with latitude indicates that global atmospheric circulation patterns and hydrological transport were not much different from those of the present, although the shallower delta(18)O vs. latitude gradient during the Eocene may reflect regional differences in precipitation, evaporation, and river recharge. At a more regional scale, the delta(18)O value of river water can provide insight into topographic relief during the early Eocene. In the case of intermontane basins of Wyoming, differences in average delta(18)O(r) values between basins indicate that Laramide mountain relief was on the order of 475 m. It is suggested that anomalously low delta(18)O(r) values reported previously do not provide unambiguous evidence for permanent snow at higher elevations and may instead reflect brief episodes of cooler winters and/or altered atmospheric circulation patterns.",2003,10.1130/B25249.1,Geology,WOS:000185074100005,Shana,Maybe,Maybe,No,Biome/National,Wyoming/NA rivers?

The loss of mature host trees results in reductions of ecosystem carbon productivity. The surviving and recruited stems, however, grow more quickly in response to the reduced competition, and carbon productivity and live basal area recover to preoutbreak levels within a few years or decades. Infestations may result in system carbon storage reductions, relative to storage among undisturbed developmental trajectories, mostly because of the temporary decrease in carbon productivity. Carbon losses in infested stands are slow as a result of recalcitrance of snags and coarse woody debris. Recalcitrant dead pools combined with recovering live pools results in fairly stable total ecosystem carbon storage among infested stands.

We linked a spatially explicit landscape fire and vegetation model (FireBGCv2) to an empirical regression equation that predicted daily stream temperatures to explore how climate change and its impacts on fire might affect stream thermal conditions across a partially forested, mountainous landscape in the western U.S. We used the model to understand the roles that wildfire and management actions such as fuel reduction and fire suppression could play in mitigating stream thermal responses to climate change. Results indicate that air temperature increases associated with future climates could account for a much larger proportion of stream temperature increases (as much as 90 % at a basin scale) than wildfire. Similarly, land management scenarios that limited wildfire prevalence had negligible effects on future stream temperature increases. These patterns emerged at broader spatial scales because wildfires typically affected only a subset of a stream's network. However, at finer spatial and temporal scales stream temperatures were sensitive to wildfire. Although wildfires will continue to cause local, short-term effects on stream temperatures, managers of aquatic systems may need to find other solutions to cope with the larger impact from climate change on future stream warming that involves adapting to the increases while developing broad strategies for riparian vegetation restoration.",2014,10.1007/s10584-014-1092-5,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,WOS:000336365300015,Adrienne,Yes,Yes,Yes,Ecosystem/Municipal,,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Shana,Maybe,Yes,Yes,Western US generally,

However, BC may cause uncertainties in projecting hydrologic and biogeochemical responses to future climate due to the impaired spatiotemporal covariance of climate variables and a breakdown of physical conservation principles. Here we quantify the impact of BC on simulated climate-driven changes in water variables (evapotranspiration (ET), runoff, snow water equivalent (SWE), and water demand for irrigation), crop yield, biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC), nitric oxide (NO) emissions, and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) export over the Pacific Northwest (PNW) region. We also quantify the impacts on net primary production (NPP) over a small watershed in the region (HJ-Andrews). Simulation results from the coupled ECHAM5-MPI-OM model with A1B emission scenario were first dynamically downscaled to 12 km resolution with the WRF model. Then a quantile-mapping-based statistical downscaling model was used to downscale them into 1/16 degrees resolution daily climate data over historical and future periods. Two climate data series were generated, with bias correction (BC) and without bias correction (NBC). Impact models were then applied to estimate hydrologic and biogeochemical responses to both BC and NBC meteorological data sets. These impact models include a macroscale hydrologic model (VIC), a coupled cropping system model (VIC-CropSyst), an ecohydrological model (RHESSys), a biogenic emissions model (MEGAN), and a nutrient export model (Global-NEWS). Results demonstrate that the BC and NBC climate data provide consistent estimates of the climate-driven changes in water fluxes (ET, runoff, and water demand), VOCs (isoprene and monoterpenes) and NO emissions, mean crop yield, and river DIN export over the PNW domain. However, significant differences rise from projected SWE, crop yield from dry lands, and HJ-Andrews's ET between BC and NBC data. Even though BC post-processing has no significant impacts on most of the studied variables when taking PNW as a whole, their effects have large spatial variations and some local areas are substantially influenced. In addition, there are months during which BC and NBC post-processing produces significant differences in projected changes, such as summer runoff. Factor-controlled simulations indicate that BC post-processing of precipitation and temperature both substantially contribute to these differences at regional scales. We conclude that there are trade-offs between using BC climate data for offline CCI studies versus directly modeled climate data. These trade-offs should be considered when designing integrated modeling frameworks for specific applications; for example, BC may be more important when considering impacts on reservoir operations in mountainous watersheds than when investigating impacts on biogenic emissions and air quality, for which VOCs are a primary indicator.",2014,10.5194/bg-11-2601-2014,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology,WOS:000337947500004,Adrienne,Yes,Yes,Yes,Landscape/State-Province,,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Shana,Maybe,Yes,Yes,PNW modelling,

Potential evapotranspiration increases over most of the PNW in summer because of rising temperatures; however, actual evapotranspiration is reduced in all but a few areas of the domain because evapotranspiration is mostly water limited in summer, and summer precipitation decreases in the simulations.

Although forest managers rely heavily on the use of silvicultural treatments that manipulate stand structure and stand dynamics to modify responses to climate change, few studies have directly assessed the effects of stand structure or canopy position on climate-growth relationships - or examined how this relationship may vary among species or across environmental gradients. In this study, we analyzed variability in tree-ring series from 15 low-elevation stands in northeastern Washington (USA) using time series analysis and linear mixed effects models. Our objective was to assess the relative influences of species (Pinus ponderosa vs. Pseudotsuga menziesii), crown class (dominant vs. intermediate), and habitat type (Xeric vs. Dry-Mesic) on the climate responses of mature trees in unmanaged forests. We found that climate-growth relationships varied significantly between canopy classes and across habitat types but that these effects were highly species-specific. For P. menziesii, growth responses to temperature and precipitation did not vary between canopy classes. For P. ponderosa, however, regression coefficients for the relationship between temperature and radial growth were nearly twice as large for dominant trees compared to intermediate trees, and 84% of dominant trees were significantly influenced by precipitation, compared to only 62% of intermediate trees. In contrast, habitat-type did not significantly affect the climate responses of P. ponderosa, but did affect responses of P. menziesii. For example, for P. menziesii only 51% of trees in Dry-Mesic sites, were significantly affected by drought (PDSI), compared to 93% in Xeric sites. A better understanding of the relationship between climate sensitivity, species-specific hydraulic strategies, and stand dynamics is crucial for accurately predicting tree responses to climate change and designing forest treatments that will effectively reduce the climatic vulnerability of key forest species and habitats. Results may assist managers with understanding how altering stand dynamics will differentially affect climate-responses of individual species.

Future projected changes in temperature are for annual increases of approximately +2 degrees C by the 2050s and +3 degrees C by the 2080s. The 2050s and 2080s precipitation projections are for increased winter precipitation in all basins and decreases in summertime precipitation for two of the three basins-with increases projected in the northeastern BC subwatershed.

Coastal headwater systems in British Columbia experience more uncertainty associated with changes during winter and the summer, whereas interior systems experience the greatest uncertainties during the winter and spring.

This study uses a regional fire emissions model to estimate the potential reduction in fire emissions when prescribed burning is applied in dry, temperate forested systems of the western U.S. Daily carbon dioxide (CO2) fire emissions for 2001-2008 were calculated for the western U.S. for two cases: a default wildfire case and one in which prescribed burning was applied.

Tree-ring data were collected from 20 mature stands of white spruce (Picea glauca), lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia), and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa). Linear relationships between annual growth variation and monthly and seasonal climate were quantified with correlation and regression analyses, and variation in climate-growth responses over a climatic gradient were quantified by regressing growth responses against local mean climatic conditions. Temperatures had more consistent and stronger correlations with growth for all three species than precipitation, but growth-climate responses varied among species and among sites. In particular, pine and fir populations showed different responses between BC and Yukon, whereas spruce showed a more consistent response across the study domain.

The purpose of this study was to examine the potential shifts in spatial distribution of three tree-line conifer species in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem under three future climate-change scenarios and to assess their potential sensitivity to changes in both temperature and precipitation. Location This study was performed using data from 275 sites within the boundaries of Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks, primarily located in Wyoming, USA. Methods We used data on tree-line conifer presence from the US Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis Program. Climatic and edaphic variables were derived from spatially interpolated maps and approximated for each of the sites. We used the random-forest prediction method to build a model of predicted current and future distributions of each of the species under various climate-change scenarios. Results We had good success in predicting the distribution of tree-line conifer species currently and under future climate scenarios. Temperature and temperature-related variables appeared to be most influential in the distribution of whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis), whereas precipitation and soil variables dominated the models for subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) and Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii). The model for whitebark pine substantially overpredicted absences (as compared with the other models), which is probably a result of the importance of biological factors in the distribution of this species. Main conclusions These models demonstrate the complex response of conifer distributions to changing climate scenarios. Whitebark pine is considered a 'keystone' species in the subalpine forests of western North America; however, it is believed to be nearly extinct throughout a substantial portion of its range owing to the combined effects of an introduced pathogen, outbreaks of the native mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae), and changing fire regimes. Given predicted changes in climate, it is reasonable to predict an overall decrease in pine-dominated subalpine forests in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. In order to manage these forests effectively with respect to future climate, it may be important to focus attention on monitoring dry mid- and high-elevation forests as harbingers of long-term change.",2008,10.1111/j.1365-2699.2007.01815.x,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Physical Geography,WOS:000253982800013,Courtney,Yes,Yes,Yes,Landscape/State-Province,Greater Yellowstone,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Shana,Maybe,Yes,Yes,Includes Teton,

To better understand the hydrologic regime of this snow resource, a detailed field program was conducted during the 2007 snowmelt season. Specifically, peak annual snow distribution, ablation-season Surface-energy exchange and mass balance were measured in a forested high-elevation catchment of the Okanagan Basin. During the snowmelt period, 1-4% of the peak annual snow-water equivalent (SWE) was lost to sublimation in open sites-averaging 0.4 min d(-1). Melt and sublimation rates increased significantly with elevation, and were observed to be higher and more variable in the open sites than under forest canopies. The largest sublimation events (>0.25 mm d(-1)) were associated with low atmospheric vapour pressure, temperatures below 0 degrees C, and higher than average wind speeds. Condensation occurred under highly stable conditions in the boundary layer when sensible heat fluxes exceeded net radiative inputs to the snow surface. Melt rates were driven almost entirely by sensible heat fluxes and exceeded 30 mm d(-1) during large-scale advection events. The results from this Study will allow water managers to better predict the amount of water available for ecological, agricultural and municipal needs. This work also provides the basis for assessing changes in snow surface energetics due to ongoing salvage cutting in forested areas affected by the current mountain pine-beetle outbreak.

In this paper we discuss connecting a distributional model describing mountain pine beetle phenology with a model of population success measured using annual growth rates derived from aerially detected counts of infested trees. This model bridges the gap between phenology predictions and population viability/growth rates for mountain pine beetle. The model is parameterized and compared with 8 years of data from a recent outbreak in central Idaho, and is driven using measured tree phloem temperatures from north and south bole aspects and cumulative forest area impacted. A model driven by observed south-side phloem temperatures and that includes a correction for forest area previously infested and killed is most predictive and generates realistic parameter values of mountain pine beetle fecundity and population growth. Given that observed phloem temperatures are not always available, we explore a variety of methods for using daily maximum and minimum ambient temperatures in model predictions.",2009,10.1007/s10980-009-9340-1,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Physical Geography; Geology,WOS:000265568500007,Courtney,Yes,Yes,Yes,Landscape/State-Province,"Central Idaho, Pine Beetles",NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Shana,Yes,Yes,Yes,"Central Idaho, Pine Beetles",

Although these temperatures are easily observed in individual stands, extrapolating the net temperature effect to an actively logged terrain is difficult due to the heterogeneous mixture of different forest stand heights and densities. Previous work has related the percentage of tree shade observed in remotely sensed imagery to forest stand structure; we further developed this proxy to derive an estimate of the near-surface daytime air temperature during the summer months. This temperature proxy can be integrated across a region using both actual shade from the modern landscape and an idealized data set representing old-growth forest. In our 10 x 20 km study area on Mt.

Our results demonstrate that differences in regional temperatures caused by industrial-scale logging are large enough to play a significant role in other physical system responses, such as the retreat of alpine glaciers near logged forests.

Although various remote sensing approaches have been developed to monitor insect impacts, most studies have focused on single insect agents or single locations and have not related observed changes to ground-based measurements. This study presents a remote sensing framework to (1) characterize spectral trajectories associated with insect activity of varying duration and severity and (2) relate those trajectories to ground-based measurements of tree mortality and surface fuels in the Cascade Range, Oregon, USA. We leverage a Landsat time series change detection algorithm (LandTrendr), annual forest health aerial detection surveys (ADS), and field measurements to investigate two study landscapes broadly applicable to conifer forests and dominant insect agents of western North America. We distributed 38 plots across multiple forest types (ranging from mesic mixed-conifer to xeric lodgepole pine) and insect agents (defoliator [western spruce budworm] and bark beetle [mountain pine beetle]). Insect effects were evident in the Landsat time series as combinations of both short- and long-duration changes in the Normalized Burn Ratio spectral index. Western spruce budworm trajectories appeared to show a consistent temporal evolution of long-duration spectral decline (loss of vegetation) followed by recovery, whereas mountain pine beetle plots exhibited both short- and long-duration spectral declines and variable recovery rates. Although temporally variable, insect-affected stands generally conformed to four spectral trajectories: short-duration decline then recovery, short- then long-duration decline, long-duration decline, long-duration decline then recovery. When comparing remote sensing data with field measurements of insect impacts, we found that spectral changes were related to cover-based estimates (tree basal area mortality R(adj)(2);= 0.40, F(1.34) = 24.76, P<0.0001] and down coarse woody detritus [R(adj)(2) = 0.29, F(1.32) = 14.72. P = 0.0006]). In contrast, ADS changes were related to count-based estimates (e.g., ADS mortality from mountain pine beetle positively correlated with ground-based counts [R(adj)(2) = 037, F(1.22) = 14.71, P= 0.0009]). Fine woody detritus and forest floor depth were not well correlated with Landsat- or aerial survey-based change metrics. By characterizing several distinct temporal manifestations of insect activity in conifer forests, this study demonstrates the utility of insect mapping methods that capture a wide range of spectral trajectories. This study also confirms the key role that satellite imagery can play in understanding the interactions among insects, fuels, and wildfire. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Observed decreases in snowpack across lower-elevation watersheds are broadly consistent with model predictions of anthropogenic climate change; however, the magnitude of the decreases across much of the Cascades, Northern Rockies and Sierra Nevada has exceeded predictions based solely on late 20th century anthropogenic warming. To resolve the disparity between observations and predictions, the influence of intramonthly variability associated with the Pacific-North American (PNA) pattern on both the percent of precipitation falling as snow and a proxy for snowmelt during late winter is examined. The PNA is shown to have a significant influence on the elevation of the freezing level across the Western United States, with positive values of the PNA generally associated with anomalously high freezing levels. The positive tendency of the PNA during late winter over the last half-century has contributed to regional increases in the elevation of the freezing level, decreases in the percent of precipitation falling as snow, and increases in snowmelt across montane and sub-montane regions. This change in atmospheric circulation accelerated the decline in mountain snowpack predicted by anthropogenic forcing. Copyright.

We adopted a population dynamics approach to determine if the effect of limit or basal area thinning could be observed in the form of differential beetle recruitment using lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud.) and ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex P. & C. Laws.) mortality data from previously published studies as a proxy measure of mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) population size. We found that mountain pine beetle populations exhibit density-dependent population dynamics that are influenced by the silvicultural history of their host's stand. Thinning did not change the epidemic equilibrium but instead caused a shift in dynamics from linear to nonlinear. In a validation test, the models developed for thinned and unthinned stands predicted reproductive rates in independent locations.

Meanwhile, conifer forests in unburned parts of the GYE have continued to increase in extent and density.

We examined changes in conifer cover across biophysical gradients in the GYE based on stratified random samples from aerial photographs. The percent conifer cover for samples in 1971 and 1999 was quantified to determine the frequency and rate of conifer cover change. A slight majority of samples (56%) showed no change, whereas increases (22%) were balanced by decreases (22%). However, among samples that were not recently burned or logged, or already closed-canopy, nearly 40% increased in conifer cover, at an average annual rate of 0.22%. We quantified significant variability in the frequency and rate of conifer cover increase across gradients of elevation, aspect, vegetation type, and proximity to nearby conifer forest. The most dynamic locations were low density conifer woodlands on northerly aspects at lower elevations, with average annual rates of increase up to 0.51%. This study is significant because it demonstrates that rates of conifer cover increase vary across biophysical gradients, an important consideration for management of dynamic forest ecosystems. Improved understanding of this variability helps us to better understand what factors ultimately cause conifer cover increase.

Because cattle (Bos taurus) grazing can impact the abundance, distribution, and ecological function of native plant and animal communities, it is important to understand how cattle might respond to increasingly arid conditions. Here, we evaluate changes in habitat selection by cattle across an 8-yr period as a function of rainfall and other environmental covariates. Using resource selection functions, we evaluated habitat selection based on 2 behaviors, stationary and mobile. Models revealed similarity in cattle habitat selection across years, with only modest changes in selection as a function of precipitation, despite marked seasonal and interannual differences in rainfall. Cattle preferred gentle slopes, forest edges, wet meadows, and areas near water as well as areas far from water on plateaus. Cattle avoided areas at intermediate distances from water, typically associated with steep slopes. As conditions became drier during the late season, cattle did not switch selection patterns but instead contracted their selection around water. Cattle also selected similar habitats whether they were mobile or stationary, possibly making microsite decisions therein. This consistent pattern of selection across years could be particularly problematic for riparian communities as climates become drier; however, it may also simplify cattle management, as range managers can focus vegetation monitoring efforts on riparian areas. Due to the uncertainty surrounding future climatic conditions, it is imperative that both range and wildlife managers develop long-term plans to continue managing these multiuse landscapes in an ecologically sustainable manner based on expected patterns of livestock grazing.",2015,10.2527/jas.2014-8794,Agriculture,WOS:000357104800060,Micah,Yes,Yes,Yes,,E.

Increasing a region's food self-reliance is a strategy to address this concern, but is a challenge in regions with limited arable lands as a result of topographically diverse, mountain-dominated landscapes. Mechanized, large-scale agriculture relies on contiguous areas of arable land, rather than small parcels of dispersed arable soils and suitable climates. The Kootenay region of British Columbia, Canada, serves as an example of the opportunities for mountainous, rural communities to increase their food self-sufficiency by considering the potential for agriculture on small parcels of land. Soil capability survey maps that provide a biophysical assessment of arable lands were used as a basis for determining (a) the potential land base available for small-scale agriculture, and (b) the potential for niche crops that may be grown on poorer capability lands in the Kootenay region. The soil capability criteria, coupled with farm survey data, were used to measure and quantify the distribution of underutilized farmland in the region. Results indicate that up to 90 percent of land capable of agriculture and 69 percent of high quality farm land protected under the Agricultural Land Reserve is not under production for crops or pasture. Global Climate Model scenarios for 2050 indicate that the region will have a longer growing season, hotter summers, and more frost-free days, which could increase the region's capacity to grow food but might require additional water for irrigation.

These outbreaks reduce plant productivity by killing trees and transfer carbon from live to dead pools where carbon is slowly emitted to the atmosphere via heterotrophic respiration which subsequently feeds back to climate change. Recent studies have begun to examine the local impacts of bark beetle outbreaks in individual stands, but the full regional carbon consequences remain undocumented for the western US. In this study, we quantify the regional carbon impacts of the bark beetle outbreaks taking place in western US forests. The work relies on a combination of postdisturbance forest regrowth trajectories derived from forest inventory data and a process-based carbon cycle model tracking decomposition, as well as aerial detection survey (ADS) data documenting the regional extent and severity of recent outbreaks. We find that biomass killed by bark beetle attacks across beetle-affected areas in western US forests from 2000 to 2009 ranges from 5 to 15TgCyr(-1) and caused a reduction of net ecosystem productivity (NEP) of about 6.1-9.3TgCy(-1) by 2009.

This study uses a stochastic conceptual snowmelt-runoff model to generate inflow ensembles for a wide range of potential temperature and precipitation scenarios as a means of testing which types of climate changes could adversely affect hydropower production. The method is applied to a case study of the Dworshak Reservoir on the North Fork of the Clearwater River in central Idaho. Reservoir operations in response to the climate-change ensemble scenarios were simulated using a decision support system operations model according to current operating criteria and guidelines. The magnitude and timing of hydropower generation resulting from each temperature- and precipitation-change scenario were examined, assuming no change from historical reservoir operations. Results showed that lower precipitation and higher temperature created less runoff and therefore less hydropower generation. However, increased precipitation and decreased temperature scenarios showed limited increases in hydropower production due to turbine capacity and other operational constraints. Firm hydropower production from Dworshak steadily decreased with increasing mean annual temperature and steadily increased with increasing mean annual precipitation. Timing of spring hydropower production shifted to earlier spring and winter with increasing temperature. Because these simulations did not adapt reservoir operations from historical procedures, they are not intended to be realistic predictions of changes in hydropower generation in the future. Rather, the results demonstrate how the approach can provide guidance about which types of hydrograph changes, such as shifts in inflow timing, might warrant changes in reservoir operations.

However, current species distribution models rely on coarse scale climate data, whereas fine scale microclimate data may be necessary to assess habitat suitability and generate predictive models. Here, we evaluate disparities between temperature data at the coarse scale from weather stations versus fine-scale data measured in microhabitats required for a climate-sensitive mammal, the American pika (Ochotona princeps). We collected two years of temperature data in occupied talus habitats predicted to be suitable (high elevation) and unsuitable (low elevation) by the bioclimatic envelope approach. At low elevations, talus surface and interstitial microclimates drastically differed from ambient temperatures measured on-site and at a nearby weather station. Interstitial talus temperatures were frequently decoupled from high ambient temperatures, resulting in instantaneous disparities of over 30 degrees C between these two measurements. Microhabitat temperatures were also highly heterogeneous, such that temperature measurements within the same patch of talus were not more correlated than measurements at distant patches. An experimental manipulation revealed that vegetation cover may cool the talus surface by up to 10 degrees C during the summer, which may contribute to this spatial heterogeneity. Finally, low elevation microclimates were milder and less variable than typical alpine habitat, suggesting that, counter to species distribution model predictions, these seemingly unsuitable habitats may actually be better refugia for this species under climate change. These results highlight the importance of fine-scale microhabitat data in habitat assessments and underscore the notion that some critical refugia may be counterintuitive.",NA,,,,Micah,Yes,Yes,Yes,,CR Gorge,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Shana,Yes,Yes,Yes,CR Gorge,

Although bark beetles are indigenous to North American forests, climate change has facilitated the beetle's expansion into previously unsuitable habitats. We used three correlative niche models (maximum entropy [MaxEnt], boosted regression trees, and generalized linear models) to estimate (1) the current potential distribution of the beetle in the U.S. Rocky Mountain region, (2) how this distribution has changed since historical outbreaks in the 1960s and 1970s, and (3) how the distribution may be expected to change under future climate scenarios. Additionally, we evaluated the temporal transferability of the niche models by forecasting historical models and testing the model predictions using temporally independent outbreak data from the current outbreak. Our results indicated that there has been a significant expansion of climatically suitable habitat over the past 50 yr and that much of this expansion corresponds with an upward shift in elevation across the study area. Furthermore, our models indicated that drought was a more prominent driver of current outbreak than temperature, which suggests a change in the climatic signature between historical and current outbreaks. Projections under future conditions suggest that there will be a large reduction in climatically suitable habitat for the beetle and that high-elevation forests will continue to become more susceptible to outbreak. While all three models generated reasonable predictions, the generalized linear model correctly predicted a higher percentage of current outbreak localities when trained on historical data.

Climate change is causing Large-scale forest declines globally, in addition to distributional shifts of many tree species. Because environmental cues dictate insect seasonality and population success, climate change is also influencing tree-killing bark beetles. The mountain pine beetle, Dendroctonus ponderosae, is a major disturbance in Pinus forests of the western US. Using a mechanistic, phenology-based demographic model driven by downscaled daily temperature data, we describe recent and future spatial and temporal thermal suitability for mountain pine beetle population growth in a topographically complex region. Trends in model-predicted growth rates among Global Climate Models were similar and suggest that, relative to future trends, mountain pine beetle population growth within the past 60 years was most optimal at middle elevations and Least optimal at the Lowest and highest elevations. This trend aligns with observed mountain pine beetle-caused tree mortality that was greatest at middle elevations between 1997 and 2013, as estimated from Aerial Detection Surveys. However, thermal suitability for optimal phenological synchrony was predicted to shift in recent years, and by the end of the century, the best thermal habitats for mountain pine beetle will be at the Lowest and highest elevations.

We measured the influence of fire severity, defined as vegetation disturbance (using a satellite-derived vegetation disturbance index, VDI), landscape features that organize hydrologic flow pathways (relief and elongation ratios), and pre-fire vegetation type on the probability of the occurrence of post-fire gully rejuvenation (GR). We combined field surveys across 270 burned low-order catchments (112 occurrences of GR) and geospatial analysis to generate a probabilistic model through logistic regression. VDI alone discriminated well between catchments where GR did and did not occur (area under the curve=0.78, model accuracy=0.72). The strong effect of vegetation disturbance on GR suggests that vegetation exerts a primary influence on the occurrence of infiltration excess run-off and post-fire erosion and that major gully erosion will not occur until fire consumes aboveground biomass. Other topographic and local factors also influenced GR response, including catchment elongation, per cent pre-fire shrub, mid-slope riparian vegetation, armoured headwaters, firehose effects, and concentration of severe burn in source areas. These factors highlight the need to consider vegetation effects in concert with local topography and site conditions to understand the propensity for flow accumulation leading to GR. We present a process-based conceptual hydrologic model where vegetation loss from fire decreases rainfall attenuation and surface roughness, leading to accelerated flow accumulation and erosion; these effects are also influenced by interactions between fire severity and landscape structure. The VDI metric provides a continuous measure of vegetation disturbance and, when placed in a hydrologic context, may improve quantitative analysis of burned-area susceptibility to erosive rainfall, hazard prediction, ecological effects of fire, landform evolution, and sensitivity to climate change.

Here we examine the effect of bedrock permeability on MTT and MTT scaling relations by comparing 15 nested research catchments in western Oregon; half within the HJ Andrews Experimental Forest and half at the site of the Alsea Watershed Study. The two sites share remarkably similar vegetation, topography, and climate and differ only in bedrock permeability (one poorly permeable volcanic rock and the other more permeable sandstone). We found longer MTTs in the catchments with more permeable fractured and weathered sandstone bedrock than in the catchments with tight, volcanic bedrock (on average, 6.2 versus 1.8 years, respectively). At the permeable bedrock site, 67% of the variance in MTT across catchments scales was explained by drainage area, with no significant correlation to topographic characteristics. The poorly permeable site had opposite scaling relations, where MTT showed no correlation to drainage area but the ratio of median flow path length to median flow path gradient explained 91% of the variance in MTT across seven catchment scales. Despite these differences, hydrometric analyses, including flow duration and recession analysis, and storm response analysis, show that the two sites share relatively indistinguishable hydrodynamic behavior.

Mortality has been extensive, and projected potential range shifts based on impending climate change have revealed further pressures to survival and adaptation for this long-lived, high-elevation conifer. Quantifying genetic variation and the mating system of whitebark pine in its northern range provides a basis for effective conservation measures. Isozyme analysis of vegetative bud tissue revealed high expected heterozygosity (0.262), moderate population differentiation (F-ST = 0.061) and highly significant correlations between observed heterozygosity and geographic variables (R-2 = 0.36, latitude; R-2 = 0.30 longitude), supporting the hypothesis that this species recolonized its current northern range following glacial retreat from several refugia in the Washington and Oregon Cascades and in the northern Rockies. Mating system analysis based on simultaneous isozyme analyses of embryo and haploid megagametophyte tissues found relatively high levels of consanguineous mating and selfing for a conifer (t(m) = 0.73) within populations. Avian seed distribution by the Clark's nutcracker (Nucifragia columbiana Wilson) appears to be the overriding factor influencing genetic patterns: being a mutualistic seed disperser, caches comprised of related seeds develop into clumped stands with strong family substructure. While it is a critical wildlife habitat component, lack of commercial utilization has made in situ adaptation the primary conservation focus. Encouraging regeneration success and nutcracker caching by maintaining natural fire regimes will provide an ecosystem-based conservation solution; however, in the Rocky Mountains between 52degreesN and 47degreesN, disease-resistant individuals should be located and propagated in order to ensure long-term survival of the species in high pathogen hazard areas.",2003,10.1023/A:1025667700479,Biodiversity & Conservation; Genetics & Heredity,WOS:000185261600004,Shana,Yes,Yes,Yes,individual,Cascades and Northern Rockies--need to look at exact location,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Shana,Maybe,,Yes,Cascades and Northern Rockies--need to look at exact location,

Climate scenarios generated by climate models at spatial resolutions ranging from about 50 km to 400 km may not provide enough spatial specificity for use in impact assessment. In Parts I and II of this paper. the spatial specificity issue is addressed by examining what information on mesoscale and small-scale spatial features can be gained by using a regional climate model with a subgrid parameterization of orographic precipitation and land surface cover, driven by a general circulation model. Numerical experiments have been performed to simulate the present-day climatology and the climate conditions corresponding to a doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentration. This paper describes and contrasts the large-scale and mesoscale features of the greenhouse warming climate signals simulated by the general circulation modal and regional climate model over the Pacific Northwest. Results indicate that changes in the large-scale circulation exhibit strong seasonal variability. There is an average warming of about 2 degrees C, and precipitation generally increases over the Pacific Northwest and decreases over California. The precipitation signal over the Pacific Northwest is only statistically significant during spring, when both the change in the large-scale circulation and increase in water vapor enhance the moisture convergence toward the north Pacific coast. The combined effects of surface temperature and precipitation changes are such that snow cover is reduced by up to 50% on average, causing large changes in the seasonal runoff. This paper also describes the high spatial resolution (1.5 km) climate signals simulated by the regional climate model. Reductions in snow cover of 50%-90% are found in areas near the snow line of the control simulation. Analyses of the variations of the climate signals with surface elevation ranging from sea level to 4000 m over two mountain ranges in the Pacific Northwest show that because of changes in the alitude of the freezing level, strong elevation dependency is found in the surface temperature, rainfall. snowfall, snow cover, and runoff signals.",1999,10.1175/1520-0442(1999)012<2031:PNCSSB>2.0.CO;2,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,WOS:000081350700011,Shana,Yes,Yes,Yes,Biome/National,Western US,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Shana,Maybe,Yes,Yes,PNW modelling,

This procedure has two main purposes. First, it can be used to generate snow covered area data in a new climate for input to runoff models such as the Snowmelt-Runoff Model (SRM). Second, it could potentially be used to provide input to climate models that require knowledge of the land area covered by snow at a given time. A computer program is now operational for use on real basins and is demonstrated on the Rio Grande basin in Colorado and the Illecillewaet River basin in British Columbia.",1994,,Water Resources,WOS:A1994PN75100001,Shana,Yes,Yes,Yes,Landscape/State-Province,Selkirk Mtns,NA,,,,,,NA,,,,,Shana,Yes,Yes,Yes,Selkirk Mtns,

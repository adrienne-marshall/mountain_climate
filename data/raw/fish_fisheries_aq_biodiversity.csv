Few F<sub>1</sub> hybrids were found, and genotype frequencies suggest strong backcrossing of hybrids to pure parental populations at both ends of the gradient. The increasing prevalence of RT alleles downstream is accompanied by a life history gradient such that RT alleles were positively associated with growth rate and negatively associated with survivorship. Although physical barriers extended the distribution of pure WCT downstream, several streams held genetically pure WCT in their uppermost reaches, even when no barriers were present. For example, RT alleles were undetectable in headwaters of Dutch Creek, which had no barriers but was very cold (average summer temperature <7.3 °C). We propose that RT alleles affect the choice of habitat, as well the metabolic characteristics that determine their life history and competitive abilities. Factors such as climate change, clear-cut logging, and anthropogenic enrichment that can lead to increased temperature and (or) productivity might be expected to result in an upstream shift of RT alleles.</p>","2010-01-01","2017-02-21 22:50:26","2017-02-21 22:50:26","","357-370","","2","67","","Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences","","","","","","","","Language: English; French.","","","Fish, Fisheries & Aquatic Biodiversity Worldwide","","NISC South Africa","","","","","","alleles; Anthropogenic Impacts; Biological Invasions / Invasive Species; Climatology / climate change; cutthoat trout; dutch creek; Ecology; fish; Genetics / Strains / Stock identification; genotypic variations; habitat use; hybridization; hybrids; life histories; life history; Physiology / Biology; rainbow trout; rivers / lakes; temperature; trout; upper oldman river","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As such, these systems may be especially vulnerable to climate change because of potential shifts in the frequency, magnitude, and timing of flows that can scour incubating embryos. A general framework is presented to examine this issue, using a series of physical models that link climate change, streamflow, and channel morphology to predict the magnitude and spatial distribution of streambed scour and consequent risk to salmonid embryos at basin scales. The approach is demonstrated for a mountain catchment in the Northern Rocky Mountains, USA. Results show that risk of critical scour varies as a function of species and life history and is modulated by local variations in lithology and channel confinement. Embryos of smaller-bodied fall spawners may be at greater risk because of shallow egg burial depths and increased rain-on-snow events during their incubation period. Scour risk for all species is reduced when changes in channel morphology (width, depth, and grain size) keep pace with climate-driven changes in streamflow. Although climate change is predicted to increase scour magnitude, the frequency of scouring events relative to typical salmonid life cycles is relatively low, indicating that individual year classes may be impacted by critical scour, but extirpation of entire populations is not expected. Furthermore, refugia are predicted to occur in unconfined portions of the stream network, where scouring shear stresses are limited to bankfull stage because overbank flows spread across alluvial floodplains; conversely, confined valleys will likely exacerbate climate-driven changes in flow and scour. Our approach can be used to prioritize management strategies according to relative risk to different species or spatial distributions of risk and can be used to predict temporal shifts in the spatial distribution of suitable spawning habitats. A critical unknown issue is whether biological adaptation can keep pace with rates of climate change and channel response","2013-01-01","2017-02-21 22:50:27","2017-02-21 22:50:27","","750-765","","5","27","","Hydrological Processes","","","","","","","","Language: English.","","","Fish, Fisheries & Aquatic Biodiversity Worldwide","","NISC South Africa","","","","","","channel morphology; Climatology / climate change; embryos; fish; Mathematical models / Equations; Montane environments; morphologic adjustment; mountain catchments; rain on snow; rivers / lakes; salmon; Snow / Ice; spawning habitats; streamflow; Watersheds / Catchments","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Considering projected increases in air temperature and changes in precipitation in the coming century, accurate assessment of suitable thermal habitats in freshwater systems is critical for predicting aquatic species' responses to changes in climate and for guiding adaptation strategies. We use a hydrologic model coupled with a stream temperature model and downscaled general circulation model outputs to explore the spatially and temporally varying changes in stream temperature for the late 21st century at the subbasin and ecological province scale for the Columbia River basin (CRB). On average, stream temperatures are projected to increase 3.5 °C for the spring, 5.2 °C for the summer, 2.7 °C for the fall, and 1.6 °C for the winter. While results indicate changes in stream temperature are correlated with changes in air temperature, our results also capture the important, and often ignored, influence of hydrological processes on changes in stream temperature. Decreases in future snowcover will result in increased thermal sensitivity within regions that were previously buffered by the cooling effect of flow originating as snowmelt. Other hydrological components, such as precipitation, surface runoff, lateral soil water flow, and groundwater inflow, are negatively correlated to increases in stream temperature depending on the ecological province and season. At the ecological province scale, the largest increase in annual stream temperature was within the Mountain Snake ecological province, which is characterized by migratory coldwater fish species. Stream temperature changes varied seasonally with the largest projected stream temperature increases occurring during the spring and summer for all ecological provinces. Our results indicate that stream temperatures are driven by local processes and ultimately require a physically explicit modeling approach to accurately characterize the habitat regulating the distribution and diversity of aquatic taxa.","2014","2016-09-28 22:53:24","2016-09-28 22:53:24","2016-09-28 22:53:24","4897–4912","","12","18","","","Climate change and stream temperature projections in the Columbia River basin","","","","","","","","","","","","search.lib.uidaho.edu","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This concept, arguably, has been developed further in wetlands than any other ecosystem. Wetlands were historically important in producing the extensive coal deposits of the Carboniferous period; key steps in human development took place in communities occupying the wetland margins of rivers, lakes and the sea; and wetlands play a key role in the hydrological cycle influencing floods and river droughts. In this paper we examine three pillars that support the wetland research agenda: hydrology, wetland origins and development, and linkages to society. We investigate these through an overview of the evolution of wetland science and assessment of the wide range of topics relating to ecosystem services covered in this Special Issue. We explain the seminal change in how modern society values the benefits of natural ecosystems and highlight the pathfinder role that wetland research has played in the paradigm shift. D.

It also inhabits green forest but little is known about occurrence and habitat use patterns outside of burned areas, especially in the Sierra Nevada of California, USA. We used point count and playback surveys to detect Black-backed Woodpeckers during 2011 – 2013 on 460 transects on 10 national forest units. We defined green forest as areas that had not burned at moderate or high severity since 1991 and were more than 2 km from areas burned at moderate or high severity within the previous eight years (n = 386 transects). We used occupancy models to examine green forest habitat associations and found positive relationships with elevation, latitude, northern aspects, number of snags, tree diameter, lodgepole pine ( Pinus contorta ) forest, and a negative relationship with slope. Estimated occupancy in green forest was higher than previously understood (0.21). In addition site colonization and extinction probability in green forest were low (0.05 and 0.19, respectively) and suggest that many of the individuals detected in green forest were not just actively dispersing across the landscape in search of burned areas, but were occupying relatively stable home ranges. The association with high elevation and lodgepole pine forest may increase their exposure to climate change as these elevation forest types are predicted to decrease in extent over the next century. Although density is high in burned forest, green forest covers significantly more area in the Sierra Nevada and should be considered in efforts to conserve this rare species","2014-01-01","2017-02-21 22:50:26","2017-02-21 22:50:26","","","","2","9","","Avian Conservation and Ecology","","","","","","","","Language: English.","","","Fish, Fisheries & Aquatic Biodiversity Worldwide","","NISC South Africa","","","","","","Birds; Ecology; fieldwork / field experiments / monitoring; Forest environments; forest management; habitat specialisation; home ranges; occupancy modelling; secondary habitat","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These tradeoffs are not always apparent, and land managers unknowingly may make decisions that diminish the value of some services while enhancing the value of others. Offset policies, such as wetland mitigation in the United States, rely on the assumption that ecosystems can be restored to provide a full suite of services. Wetlands provide many ecosystem services such as water quality maintenance, carbon storage, flood abatement, and biodiversity support. Our objectives were to describe tradeoffs among ecosystem services in mitigation wetlands and identify abiotic and biotic drivers underlying these tradeoffs. We measured denitrification potential, organic matter decomposition, herbaceous biomass, and soil organic content as indicators of nutrient storage and removal services in 30 mitigation wetlands in Illinois, USA. Additionally, we estimated surface-water storage potential, and, since wetlands provide valuable biodiversity support, we determined the species composition of plant, anuran, and avian communities. We found a positive relationship among biodiversity indicators for different taxa. Denitrification potential and surface-water storage potential were positively correlated. However, there was a tradeoff between biodiversity support and nutrient cycling processes; soil organic matter, biomass, decomposition rates, and potential denitrification were greater at less biodiverse sites. Our findings indicate that optimizing restored wetlands for nutrient storage and removal may come at the expense of biodiversity. It is unrealistic to expect all services to be maximized at a restoration site. Therefore, restoration practitioners should prioritize services based on needs and opportunities given local and watershed contexts.","2015","2016-04-27 03:48:43","2016-04-27 03:48:43","","341–348","","","191","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","search.lib.uidaho.edu","","","","","","","Anura; Biodiversity; Biological Diversity; Biomass; Carbon; Conservation; D 04060; Decision Making; Decomposition; Denitrification; Ecological Restoration; ENA 15; Floods; Issues in Sustainable Development; Landscape Context; M3 1010; Management and Conservation; Mitigation; Nutrients; Offset Policies; Organic Matter; Plant Communities; Renewable Resources-Terrestrial; Soil; Soils (Organic); Species Composition; Storage; Surface Water; USA, Illinois; Water Quality; Watersheds; Wetland Mitigation; Wetlands","","","","Jessop, Jordan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The subsequent paucity of information prevents a comprehensive investigation of their properties and this must be addressed. Here we examine the evidence for the potential significance of small wetlands with regard to delivery of ecosystem services (ESs) and conclude that small wetlands often have a positive effect on their delivery, especially water quality, water regulation and biodiversity conservation. However these benefits can be offset by the emission of greenhouse gases. We suggest that, in future, wetlands should not be assessed on size alone, but rather in the context of both their location in the landscape and interaction with hydrological pathways. Furthermore, tools need to be developed to assess the type and efficiency of ESs delivered from all wetlands. Z.W. Kundzewicz; M.C. Acreman Blackwell, M.S.A. and Pilgrim, E.S., 2011.

During our study, the basin contained three sculpin taxa whose taxonomy was under revision. All three taxa were formerly referred to the genus Cottus but are now treated as Uranidea. Our goal was to improve understanding of the distribution and ecology of two of the taxa. From 2006 to 2009, we sampled 144 reaches in 31 streams and rivers to determine distributions of each taxa across the study area and within streams. We collected habitat data in 2007 and stream temperature data from 2006–2009 to identify correlates of sculpin distributions. In streams where both taxa occurred, Rocky Mountain Sculpin Uranidea sp. cf. bairdii were downstream and Columbia Slimy Sculpin U. sp. cf. cognata were upstream with a syntopic zone in between. Summer stream temperatures strongly influenced sculpin distributions, with mean August 2007 water temperatures increasing in order of reaches characterized as: Columbia Slimy Sculpin-dominated, syntopic, Rocky Mountain Sculpin-dominated, and no sculpin. Columbia Slimy Sculpin occurred in cold tributaries of the Blackfoot, Clark Fork, and Bitterroot rivers and in two coldwater refugia in the mainstem Bitterroot River. In contrast, Rocky Mountain Sculpin occupied warmer downstream segments of many Blackfoot and Clark Fork river tributaries as well as some mainstem reaches of both rivers but were absent from the Bitterroot River drainage. Persistence of the taxa will likely depend, both directly and indirectly, on future water temperatures, and thus, sculpins are appropriate targets for researching and monitoring biological changes resulting from climate change","2015-01-01","2017-02-21 22:50:27","2017-02-21 22:50:27","","416-428","","2","2015","","Copeia","","","","","","","","Language: English.","","","Fish, Fisheries & Aquatic Biodiversity Worldwide","","NISC South Africa","","","","","","Distribution / Biogeography; Ecology; environmental conditions; fish; habitat data; sculpins; spatial partitioning; temperature effects; upper clark fork river","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The global studies lack the specificity to inform decision making, while the local studies do little to clarify potential changes over large regions (major river basins, states, or groups of states), a scale often important in the development of water policy. An analysis of the potential impact of climate change on groundwater recharge across the western United States (west of 100 degrees longitude) is presented synthesizing existing studies and applying current knowledge of recharge processes and amounts. Eight representative aquifers located across the region were evaluated. For each aquifer published recharge budget components were converted into four standard recharge mechanisms: diffuse, focused, irrigation, and mountain-systems recharge. Future changes in individual recharge mechanisms and total recharge were then estimated for each aquifer. Model-based studies of projected climate-change effects on recharge were available and utilized for half of the aquifers. For the remainder, forecasted changes in temperature and precipitation were logically propagated through each recharge mechanism producing qualitative estimates of direction of changes in recharge only (not magnitude). Several key patterns emerge from the analysis. First, the available estimates indicate average declines of 10-20% in total recharge across the southern aquifers, but with a wide range of uncertainty that includes no change. Second, the northern set of aquifers will likely incur little change to slight increases in total recharge. Third, mountain system recharge is expected to decline across much of the region due to decreased snowpack, with that impact lessening with higher elevation and latitude. Factors contributing the greatest uncertainty in the estimates include: (1) limited studies quantitatively coupling climate projections to recharge estimation methods using detailed, process-based numerical models; (2) a generally poor understanding of hydrologic flowpaths and processes in mountain systems; (3) difficulty predicting the response of focused recharge to potential changes in the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events; and (4) unconstrained feedbacks between climate, irrigation practices, and recharge in highly developed aquifer systems.

The tools feature spatial multicriteria analysis as the means to make spatially explicit trade-offs between stakeholder objectives in three different ways: as colors on multiple printed maps, qualitatively on a single digital map and quantitatively on a single digital map. An interactive mapping device is used as the interface between spatial information and participants. A series of controlled experiments was conducted with 30 participants, who were asked to use the tools and perform specific individual and group allocation tasks. Data on the responses of the participants were collected through questionnaires, observer notes, video film and multicriteria scores. The analysis focused on three aspects of effectiveness: usefulness of the tools; clarity of tool information; and impact on decisions. The findings of this analysis are discussed within the context of the information offered by the tools, individual and collaborative work of participants and the spatial and numerical quality of the resulting land use plans. From the experiments, it is clear that the cognitive effort related to the volume and format of information is a critical issue in spatial decision support. This holds true for both the level of detail per item of information and the amount of information to be supplied to the participants. Although the quantitative tool provided the most information, the participants did not consider this tool the most useful and it did not produce the best results.","2013-01","2016-11-04 22:39:49","2016-11-04 22:39:49","2016-11-04 22:39:49","159-175","","","39","","Environmental Modelling & Software","Effectiveness of collaborative map-based decision support tools","Thematic Issue on the Future of Integrated Modeling Science and Technology","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\coope\AppData\Roaming\Zotero\Zotero\Profiles\istgp9md.default\zotero\storage\CD9SVK8Z\S1364815212000801.html","","","Collaborative decision support; GIS; Land Use Planning; MCA; Support information; Tool effectiveness","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Considering projected increases in air temperature and changes in precipitation in the coming century, accurate assessment of suitable thermal habitats in freshwater systems is critical for predicting aquatic species' responses to changes in climate and for guiding adaptation strategies. We use a hydrologic model coupled with a stream temperature model and downscaled general circulation model outputs to explore the spatially and temporally varying changes in stream temperature for the late 21st century at the subbasin and ecological province scale for the Columbia River basin ( CRB). On average, stream temperatures are projected to increase 3.5 °C for the spring, 5.2 °C for the summer, 2.7 °C for the fall, and 1.6 °C for the winter. While results indicate changes in stream temperature are correlated with changes in air temperature, our results also capture the important, and often ignored, influence of hydrological processes on changes in stream temperature. Decreases in future snowcover will result in increased thermal sensitivity within regions that were previously buffered by the cooling effect of flow originating as snowmelt. Other hydrological components, such as precipitation, surface runoff, lateral soil water flow, and groundwater inflow, are negatively correlated to increases in stream temperature depending on the ecological province and season. At the ecological province scale, the largest increase in annual stream temperature was within the Mountain Snake ecological province, which is characterized by migratory coldwater fish species. Stream temperature changes varied seasonally with the largest projected stream temperature increases occurring during the spring and summer for all ecological provinces. Our results indicate that stream temperatures are driven by local processes and ultimately require a physically explicit modeling approach to accurately characterize the habitat regulating the distribution and diversity of aquatic taxa","2014-01-01","2017-02-21 22:50:26","2017-02-21 22:50:26","","4897-4912","","12","18","","Hydrology and Earth System Sciences","","","","","","","","Language: English.","","","Fish, Fisheries & Aquatic Biodiversity Worldwide","","NISC South Africa","","","","","","air temperature; aquatic organisms; Climatology / climate change; cold water fish; Ecology; general circulation model; hydrological components; Hydrology; Mathematical models / Equations; precipitation; rivers / lakes; thermal sensitivity; water temperature","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) (exposed or blocked), temperature (6 °C and 14 °C), and nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, and nitrogen plus phosphorus) were manipulated in a factorial design to determine how these factors interact to affect phytoplankton growth. Four major phytoplankton taxa (two diatoms, one chrysophyte, and one dinoflagellate) were found in the water samples across all treatments. Greater growth rates were observed at the higher temperature for all taxa, except the chrysophyte. UVR depressed the growth rates of all phytoplankton at 6 °C regardless of nutrient conditions. In contrast, at 14 °C, a negative effect of UVR was not observed for any species in the absence of nutrient additions; only with the addition of nutrients did UVR exposure depress the growth of one diatom species and the dinoflagellate. Our results suggest that in alpine lakes, the effects of UVR exposure on phytoplankton depend on temperature and nutrient availability, indicating that climate change and enhanced atmospheric nitrogen deposition are likely to alter UV-temperature-nutrient relationships of plankton in high-UV systems","2005-01-01","2017-02-21 22:50:26","2017-02-21 22:50:26","","1362-1367","","5","50","","Limnology and Oceanography","","","","","","","","Language: English.","","","Fish, Fisheries & Aquatic Biodiversity Worldwide","ahaider@deat.gov.za or The Librarian, Marine and Coastal Management, Private Bag X2, Roggebaai, Cape Town 8012, South Africa","NISC South Africa","","","","","","alpine environmentss; alpine lakes; cdom [chromophoric dissolved organic matter]; cell densities; nutrient limitations [ill]; physicochemical factors; Physiology / Biology; phytoplankton growth [ill]; plankton; temperature effects; uvr [ultraviolet radiation]; water chemistry","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We apply a multi-input, multi-output profit maximization model to detailed farm-level production data from the Oregon Willamette Valley to predict each producer's response to a targeted fertilizer tax policy. Their resulting production decisions are included in a biophysical model of basin-level soil and water quality. Building on a general regulation problem for nonpoint pollution, we use a hybrid genetic algorithm to integrate the economic and biophysical models into one bilevel multiobjective optimization problem, the joint maximization of farm profits and minimization of Nitrate runoff resulting from fertilizer usage. This approach allows us to more fully endogenize fertilizer reduction cost, rather than assume an average cost relationship. The solution set of tax rates generates the Pareto optimal frontier at the watershed level. We then measure the tradeoffs between maximum profit and Nitrogen loading for individual farms, subject to the solution fertilizer tax policy. We find considerable variation in tradeoff values across the basin, which could be used to target incentives for reducing Nitrogen loading to agricultural producers under non-uniform control strategies.","2015-07","2016-03-10 14:59:34","2016-03-10 14:59:34","2016-03-10 14:59:34","1-12","","","11","","Water Resources and Economics","Valuing water quality tradeoffs at different spatial scales","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\coope\AppData\Roaming\Zotero\Zotero\Profiles\istgp9md.default\zotero\storage\EZZCGIAR\S2212428415300025.html","","","Bilevel multiobjective optimization; Conservation targeting; Integrated modeling; Nonpoint pollution; Tradeoff analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hydrologic simulation is performed by driving the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model over the Pacific Northwest region, for historical and future time periods. Extreme event analysis is then conducted using spatial hierarchical Bayesian modeling (SHB). Ensemble merging of extreme runoff is carried out using Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) in which spatially distributed weights corresponding to each regional climate model are obtained. Comparison of the residuals before and after the multi-model combination shows that the merged signal generally outperforms the best individual signal. The climate model simulations show close performance regarding maximum and minimum temperature and wind speed, however, the differences are more pronounced for precipitation and runoff. Between-model variances increase for the future time series compared to the historical ones indicating larger uncertainties in climate change projections. The combined model is then used to predict projected seasonal runoff extremes and compare them with historical simulations. Ensemble average results suggest that seasonal extreme runoff will increase in most regions in particular the Rockies and west of the Cascades.

We previously showed that winter severity is associated with non-experience-based differences in memory and the hippocampus over a large continental scale in food-caching black-capped chickadees, Poecile atricapillus . However, large climatic differences also occur along steep elevational gradients in montane environments over a small geographical scale. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that large differences in memory and the hippocampus exist over extremely short distances (10km) along the elevation gradient. We found that food-caching mountain chickadees ( P . gambeli ) from the highest elevations in the Sierra Nevada Mountains had significantly better spatial memory associated with larger hippocampi, with almost twice the number of hippocampal neurons, than individuals only 600m lower in elevation. We found similarly large differences in hippocampal neurogenesis rates as indicated by the total number of immature neurons. Our study therefore suggests that climate-related environmental differences can produce dramatic differences in memory and the hippocampus in animals within close proximity on small spatial scales and that currently observed trends in global climate may have significant effects on cognition and the brain","2012-01-01","2017-02-21 22:50:26","2017-02-21 22:50:26","","121-127","","1","84","","Animal Behaviour","","","","","","","","Language: English.","","","Fish, Fisheries & Aquatic Biodiversity Worldwide","","NISC South Africa","","","","","","Behaviour / Psychology; Birds; blackcapped chickadees; climatic differences; Climatology / climate change; Distribution / Biogeography; elevational gradients; food caching; Montane environments; sierra nevada mountains","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Albertine Rift region in East Africa is one of the world's most threatened biodiversity hotspots due to dense smallholder agriculture, high levels of land and resource pressures, and habitat loss and conversion. Results of three separate household surveys conducted in the vicinity of Kibale National Park during the late 2000s indicate that farmers are concerned with variable precipitation. Many survey respondents reported that conditions are drier and rainfall timing is becoming less predictable. Analysis of daily rainfall data for the climate normal period 1981 to 2010 indicates that total rainfall both within and across seasons has not changed significantly, although the timing and transitions of seasons has been highly variable. Results of rainfall data analysis also indicate significant changes in the intra-seasonal rainfall distribution, including longer dry periods within rainy seasons, which may contribute to the perceived decrease in rainfall and can compromise food security. Our results highlight the need for fine-scale climate information to assist agro-ecological communities in developing effective adaptive management.","2012","2016-03-17 18:12:40","2016-03-17 18:12:40","","e32408","","2","7","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","Primo","","","","","","","Biology; Earth Sciences; Ecology; Research Article; Social And Behavioral Sciences","","","","Añel, Juan A.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The River Environment Classification (REC) is an alternative approach to landscape-scale river classification. The REC classifies individual sections of river networks according to the climate, topography, geology, and land cover of the unique upstream watershed of each section. The classification is hierarchical and is based on the assumption that climate, topography, geology, and land cover are dominant causes of spatial variation in physical and biological characteristics of rivers at 4 spatial scales. The ability of the REC to explain variation in invertebrate samples collected from 237 sites in New Zealand was compared to that of region-based classifications using classification strength tests. Classifications with differing numbers of classes were compared using relative classification strengths calculated by expressing absolute classification strength as a proportion of the classification strength reached by an a posteriori classification with the same number of classes. The a posteriori classifications were derived by clustering sites by their invertebrate assemblage, so the classifications were close to the maximum possible strength attainable for a set number of classes. The relative classification strength of the REC was compared with an existing ecoregion classification and with classes that were defined by clustering sites based on intersite distances. The relative classification strength of the REC was higher (>55% of maximum attainable) than the strengths of classifications based on ecoregions (45%) or distance-based classes (<47%) when presence/absence data were used. The relative classification strength of the REC also was higher (>28% of maximum atainable) than the strengths of classifications based on ecoregions (22%) or distance-basedt classes (<24%) when relative abundance data were used. The higher classification strength of the REC was attributed to its explicit consideration of the causes of spatial variation in ecological characteristics of rivers. In addition, the REC was more likely than ecoregion classification to differentiate among geographically close sites that had contrasting watershed conditions because the REC represented the network spatial structure of rivers. However, the classification strength of the REC was low, indicating that it provided a general representation of ecological patterns, but could not be used to predict assemblage characteristics reliably for a specific site.","2004","2016-02-28 22:01:53","2016-02-28 22:01:53","","580–598","","3","23","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","Primo","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We focus on the South Hills crossbill ( Loxia curvirostra complex), which is endemic to about 70 km 2 of Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine ( Pinus contorta latifolia) forest in southern Idaho, USA. 2. Our results indicate that the South Hills crossbill has declined by over 60% between 2003 and 2008, and that decreasing adult survival drives this population decline. 3. We evaluated the relative support for multiple hypotheses linking crossbill survival to climate, an ectoparasitic mite (scaly-leg mites Knemidokoptes jamaicensis), and the recent emergence of West Nile virus. Changes in adult apparent survival rate were closely associated with average spring and annual temperatures, and with high temperatures ( ≥32 °C) during summer, which have increased during the last decade. In contrast, there was little evidence that scaly-leg mites or West Nile virus contributed to recent declines in adult survival. 4. The most probable mechanism causing the decline in adult survival and population size is a decrease in the availability of their primary food resource, seeds in serotinous pine cones. Cone production has declined with increasing annual temperatures, and these cones appear to be prematurely opening owing to increasingly hot summer conditions releasing their seeds and reducing the carrying capacity for crossbills later in the year. 5. In light of regional climate change forecasts, which include an increase in both annual temperature and hot days (>C), and the likely disappearance of lodgepole pine from southern Idaho by the end of this century, additional research is needed to determine how to maintain lodgepole pine forests and their supply of seeds to conserve one of the few bird species endemic to the continental United States","2012-01-01","2017-02-21 22:50:27","2017-02-21 22:50:27","","352-363","","2","81","","Journal of Animal Ecology","","","","","","","","Language: English.","","","Fish, Fisheries & Aquatic Biodiversity Worldwide","","NISC South Africa","","","","","","Birds; carrying capacity; climate forecasts; Climatology / climate change; Ecology; lodgepole pine; migratory bird species; south hills crossbill; trophic interactions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It will also alter seasonal patterns of water availability and affect water quality and the health of aquatic ecosystems with various implications for social and economic wellbeing. Policy development for water resource adaptation needs to allow for a holistic and transparent analysis of the probable consequences of policy options for the wide variety of water uses and users, and the existing ecosystem services associated with any stream basin. This paper puts forward an innovative methodological framework for planning development-compatible climate policies drawing on multi-criteria decision analysis and an implicit risk-management approach to the economics of climate change. Its objectives are to describe how the generic methodology could be tailored for analysis of long-range water planning and policy options in developing countries, and to describe the place of climate change considerations in water governance and planning processes. An experimental thought-exercise applying the methodology to water policy development in Yemen provides further insights on the complexity of water adaptation planning. It also highlights the value of conducting sensitivity analysis to explore the implications of multiple climate scenarios, and the importance of accounting for policy portfolios rather than individual policy options. Rather than constituting a tool that can generate clear measures of optimal solutions in the context of adaptation to uncertain climate futures, we find that this approach is best suited to supporting comprehensive and inclusive planning processes, where the focus is on finding socially acceptable paths forward.","2014","2016-04-07 04:29:40","2016-04-07 04:29:40","","289–308","","3","19","","","Water resource management and climate change adaptation","","","","","","","eng","","","","","Primo","","","","","","","Adaptability; adaptation; Adaptations; Anthropogenic Climate Changes; Anthropogenic Factors; AQ 00008; Available Water; Climate Change; Climates; CLIMATIC changes; Developing Countries; Drought and Floods; Droughts; Economics; ECOSYSTEMS; Effects of Pollution; ENA 02; Environment; Environmental Policy; Floods; Innovations; Issues in Sustainable Development; M2 556.16; M3 1010; Mechanical and Natural Changes; National Planning; Network design; Planning; Policies; Public Policy and Climate; Q5 08521; R2 23050; Resource Development; Runoff (556.16); Sensitivity Analysis; Socioeconomics; Stream; Streams; SW 5010; Toxicology & Environmental Safety; Water Management; Water Policy; Water Quality; Water Resources; Water Resources Management; Water Use; Yemen","","","","Miller, Kathleen","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This input further attenuates the penetration of solar radiation, leading to the view that opaque lakes are more ""protected"" from solar ultraviolet radiation ( UVR) than clear ones. Vertical mixing, however, complicates this view as cells are exposed to fluctuating radiation regimes, for which the effects have, in general, been neglected. Furthermore, the combined impacts of mixing, together with those of UVR and nutrient inputs are virtually unknown. In this study, we carried out complex in situ experiments in three high mountain lakes of Spain (Lake Enol in the National Park Picos de Europa, Asturias, and lakes Las Yeguas and La Caldera in the National Park Sierra Nevada, Granada), used as model ecosystems to evaluate the joint impact of these climate change variables. The main goal of this study was to address the question of how short-term pulses of nutrient inputs, together with vertical mixing and increased UVR fluxes modify the photosynthetic responses of phytoplankton. The experimentation consisted in all possible combinations of the following treatments: (a) solar radiation: UVR + PAR (280–700 nm) versus PAR ( photosynthetically active radiation) alone (400–700 nm); (b) nutrient addition (phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N)): ambient versus addition (P to reach to a final concentration of 30 μg P L−1, and N to reach N:P molar ratio of 31); and (c) mixing: mixed (one rotation from surface to 3 m depth (speed of 1 m 4 min −1, total of 10 cycles)) versus static. Our findings suggest that under ambient nutrient conditions there is a synergistic effect between vertical mixing and UVR, increasing phytoplankton photosynthetic inhibition and excretion of organic carbon ( EOC) from opaque lakes as compared to algae that received constant mean irradiance within the epilimnion. The opposite occurs in clear lakes where antagonistic effects were determined, with mixing partially counteracting the negative effects of UVR. Nutrient input, mimicking atmospheric pulses from Saharan dust, reversed this effect and clear lakes became more inhibited during mixing, while opaque lakes benefited from the fluctuating irradiance regime. These climate change related scenarios of nutrient input and increased mixing, would not only affect photosynthesis and production in lakes, but might also further influence the microbial loop and trophic interactions via enhanced EOC under fluctuating UVR exposure","2013-01-01","2017-02-21 22:50:26","2017-02-21 22:50:26","","1037-1050","","2","10","","Biogeosciences","","","","","","","","Language: English.","","","Fish, Fisheries & Aquatic Biodiversity Worldwide","","NISC South Africa","","","","","","climate change variables; Climatology / climate change; lake enol; lake la caldera; lake las yeguas; Montane environments; nitrogen; phosphorus; photosynthetically active radiation; plankton; rivers / lakes; solar radiation; water clarity; Water quality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, we hypothesized that warming of fishless alpine ponds would suppress large-bodied consumers (e.g., cladocerans, copepods) and stimulate fast-growing microorganisms (e.g., phytoflagellates, rotifers), thereby altering the community composition and total abundance of zooplankton and phytoplankton. This hypothesis was tested using three blocks of four experimental mesocosms (1000-liter capacity) that were located next to alpine ponds in Banff National Park, Canada. Each block received unfiltered pond water and sediment from a pond following ice out in June 2000. A warming treatment (control vs. 3.6 degrees Celsius warmed) was achieved by controlling the ventilation of greenhouse canopies that were suspended over each of the mesocosms. By the end of our 50-d experiment, warming significantly suppressed total zooplankton biomass because large cladocerans (Daphnia pulex) declined while rotifer (Keratella cochlearis, Conochilus unicornis) abundance increased during the second half of the experiment. In contrast, warming did not affect total phytoplankton biomass but significantly altered community composition by favoring phytoflagellates (Mallomonas, Synura, Trachelomonas) over larger filamentous green algae (Mougeotia, Phymatodocis). Warming did not significantly increase dissolved nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations. Therefore, warmer growing conditions and reduced grazer biomass best explained the increased abundance of more edible, fast-growing phytoflagellates in the warmed mesocosms. Our findings support the hypothesis that moderate warming can destabilize plankton dynamics, thereby potentially reducing the reliability of water quality and food resources for higher trophic levels (e.g., planktivorous fish) in shallow cold-water ecosystems","2004-01-01","2017-02-21 22:50:26","2017-02-21 22:50:26","","1182-1190","","4","49","","Limnology and Oceanography","","","","","","","","Language: English.","","","Fish, Fisheries & Aquatic Biodiversity Worldwide","","NISC South Africa","","","","","","abundance; Alberta; banff national park; biology; biomass; Canada; climate; climate changes; climate warming; climatology; community composition; ecosystems; environmental effects; fieldwork / field experiments / monitoring; freshwater environments; global warming; greenhouse effects; meteorology; North America; nutrient availabilities; phytoplankton; plankton; ponds; topixte; topixtj; zooplankton","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The case studies demonstrate the context specificity of societal efforts to adapt ecosystems to climate change and involve applications of diverse scientific tools (e.g., scenario analyses, downscaled climate projections, ecological and connectivity models) tailored to specific planning and management situations (alternative energy siting, wetland management, rangeland management, open space planning). They illustrate how existing institutional and policy frameworks provide numerous opportunities to advance adaptation related to ecosystems and suggest that progress is likely to be greatest when scientific knowledge is integrated into collective planning and when supportive policies and financing enable action.","2015-03","2016-03-05 15:13:30","2016-03-05 15:13:30","2016-03-05 15:13:30","247-262","","3","65","","BioScience","","","","","","","","","","","","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","","adaptation; ADAPTATION (Biology); adaptive capacity; CALIFORNIA; CLIMATIC changes; ECOLOGICAL impact; ECOSYSTEMS; ecosystem service; Global Change; Mediterranean climate.; SPATIO-temporal variation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By applying theoretical concepts from policy analysis and social studies of science about knowledge utilization, problem structuring and the boundaries between science and policy to the issue of ecological indicators, we aim to contribute to our understanding not only of the development but more importantly of the actual use of ecological indicators in policy processes and the importance of political context. Our interest is in those ecological indicators that attempt to measure the ecological quality of ecosystems and that can be or are specifically developed to be used as instruments to evaluate the effects of policies on nature. We claim that these indicators, although they are highly dependent on scientific knowledge, cannot be solely science-based, due to the complexity of ecosystems and the normative aspects involved in assessing ecosystem quality. As a result, we situate ecological indicators in a fuzzy area between science and policy and between the production and the use of scientific knowledge. We will argue that ecological indicators can be expected to be used or rejected strategically, dependent on policy context. Furthermore we will argue that ecological indicators cannot be evaluated with traditional scientific quality criteria alone. The article concludes with some lessons for future indicator development one of them being the inclusion of stakeholder perspectives.","2007","2016-02-28 22:05:57","2016-02-28 22:05:57","","215–228","","2","7","","","Ecological indicators","","","","","","","eng","","","","","Primo","","","","","","","Boundary Work; Ecological Indicator; Knowledge Utilization; Nature Conservation Policy; Science Policy Interface","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Fish life history and population genetic variation were shaped by climate change, repeated formation and subsidence of ice sheets, sea-level change, volcanism and tectonics, isostatic rebound, and now human activities. It is widely recognized in Chinook salmon ( Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) that parallel evolution and phenotypic plasticity have obscured range-wide patterns of life-history segregation with evolutionary lineage, yet the idea of the lineages themselves persists. We employed a large, internationally standardized, microsatellite data set to explore population structure at coast-wide scale and test for two divergent lineages, whether or not related to life history. We found at least 27 distinct lineages. However, relationships among groups were poorly resolved — essentially a star phylogeny. We found pervasive isolation by distance among groups, complicating cluster analysis. Only in the interior Columbia River (east of the Cascade Mountains) is there a deep genetic bifurcation that supports both the two-lineage hypothesis and the life-history segregation hypothesis.

We used data collected during fall 2008 and 2009 by 16 WSR-88D radars in the northeastern U.S. to quantify the spatial distribution of landbirds during migratory stopover. We geo-referenced estimates based on radar reflectivity, of the density of migrants aloft at their abrupt evening exodus from daytime stopover sites, to the approximate locations from which they emerged. We classified bird stopover use by the magnitude and variation of radar reflectivity across nights; areas were considered “important” stopover sites for conservation if bird density was consistently high. We developed statistical models that predict potentially important stopover sites across the region, based on land cover, ground elevation, and geographic location. Large areas of regionally important stopover sites were located along the coastlines of Long Island Sound, throughout the Delmarva Peninsula, in areas surrounding Baltimore and Washington, along the western edge of the Adirondack Mountains, and within the Appalachian Mountains of southwestern Virginia and West Virginia. Locally important stopover sites generally were associated with deciduous forests embedded within landscapes dominated by developed or agricultural lands, or near the shores of major water bodies. Preserving or enhancing patches of natural habitat, particularly deciduous forests, in developed or agricultural landscapes and along major coastlines could be a priority for conservation plans addressing the stopover requirements of migratory landbirds in the northeastern U.S. Our maps of important stopover sites can be used to focus conservation efforts and can serve as a sampling frame for fieldwork to validate radar observations or for ecological studies of landbirds on migratory stopover","2014-01-01","2017-02-21 22:50:27","2017-02-21 22:50:27","","357-370","","3","116","","Condor","","","","","","","","Language: English.","","","Fish, Fisheries & Aquatic Biodiversity Worldwide","","NISC South Africa","","","","","","agricultural lands; Behaviour / Psychology; Birds; Climatology / climate change; Conservation / Preservation; deciduous forest; Ecology; habitat conservation; landbird migrations; predictive mapping; radar reflectivity; Remote sensing / GIS (Geographical Information Systems); stopover sites; Techniques / Apparatus / Gear / Methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The region is also the headwater source for three of the continent’s great rivers: Columbia, Missouri and Saskatchewan that flow to the Pacific, Atlantic and Arctic Oceans, respectively. Headwaters originate in high elevation alpine environs characterized by high snow accumulations in winter and rainstorms in summer. Most headwaters of the region contain high quality waters with few ions in solution and extremely low nutrient concentrations. Alpine streams have few species of aquatic organisms; however, they often possess rare species and have hydrogeomorphic features that make them vulnerable to climatic change. Subalpine and valley bottom streams of the Crown of the Continent Ecosystem ( CCE) flow through well forested watersheds. Along the elevation gradient, the streams and rivers of the CCE flow through series of confining and nonconfining valleys resulting in distinct canyon and floodplain reaches. The alluvial floodplains are characterized by high species diversity and bioproduction maintained by the hydrologic linkages of habitats. The streams and rivers of the CCE have low nutrient concentrations, but may be significantly affected by wildfire, various resource extraction activities, such as logging or mining and exurban encroachment. Wildfire has been shown to increase nutrient loading in streams, both during a fire and then following the fire for as much as 5years. Logging practices increase nutrient loading and the algal productivity of stream periphyton. Logging and associated roads are also known to increase sediment transport into Crown of the Continent streams directly affecting spawning success of native trout. The CCE is one of the fastest growing regions in the USA because of the many recreational amenities of the region. And, while the region has many remarkably pristine headwater streams and receiving rivers, there are many pending threats to water quality and quantity. One of the most urgent threats comes from the coal and gas fields in the northern part of the Crown of the Continent, where coal deposits are proposed for mountain-top removal and open-pit mining operations. This will have significant effects on the waters of the region, its native plants and animals and quality of life of the people","2007-01-01","2017-02-21 22:50:26","2017-02-21 22:50:26","","104-117","","1","43","","American Water Resources Association.

In this study we examine the observed trend in summer temperature of the Fraser River and compare it with temperatures calculated as part of a global climate model ( GCM) simulation in which atmospheric greenhouse gases are increasing. We then use the GCM to consider how these trends might continue through the present century. Both the observations and model indicate that during the last half of the 20th century, the summer temperature near the river mouth has been increasing at a rate of approximately 0.12°C per decade in August. In this study we use an online method in which river temperatures are calculated directly as part of a GCM simulation and project how summer temperature near the mouth of the Fraser River might change by the end of the present century. The results indicate that between 2000 and 2100 river temperatures will increase in all summer months with a maximum increase of 0.14°C per decade in August.

In this report, we develop a method for assessing population viability and two ways to integrate these population-level assessments into an assessment of ESU viability. Population viability is assessed with quantitative extinction models or criteria relating to population size, population growth rate, the occurrence of catastrophic declines, and the degree of hatchery influence. ESU viability is assessed by examining the number and distribution of viable populations across the landscape and their proximity to sources of catastrophic disturbance. Central Valley spring-run and winter-run Chinook salmon ESUs are not currently viable, according to the criteria-based assessment. In both ESUs, extant populations may be at low risk of extinction, but these populations represent a small portion of the historical ESUs, and are vulnerable to catastrophic disturbance. The winter-run Chinook salmon ESU, in the extreme case, is represented by a single population that spawns outside of its historical spawning range. We are unable to assess the status of the Central Valley steelhead ESU with our framework because almost all of its roughly 80 populations are classified as data deficient. The few exceptions are those populations with a closely associated hatchery, and the naturally-spawning fish in these streams are at high risk of extinction. Population monitoring in this ESU is urgently needed. Global and regional climate change poses an additional risk to the survival of salmonids in the Central Valley. A literature review suggests that by 2100, mean summer temperatures in the Central Valley region may increase by 2-8°C, precipitation will likely shift to more rain and less snow, with significant declines in total precipitation possible, and hydrographs will likely change, especially the the southern Sierra Nevada mountains. Warming at the lower end of the predicted range may allow spring-run Chinook salmon to persist in some streams, while making some currently utilized habitat inhospitable. At the upper end of the range of predicted warming, very little spring-run Chinook salmon habitat is expected to remain suitable. In spite of the precarious position of Central Valley salmonid ESUs, there are prospects for greatly improving their viability. Recovering Central Valley ESUs may require re-establishing populations where historical populations have been extirpated (e.g., upstream of major dams). Such major efforts should be focused on those watersheds that offer the best possibility of providing suitable habitat in a warmer future","2007-01-01","2017-02-21 22:50:26","2017-02-21 22:50:26","","no number","","1","5","","San Francisco Estuary and watershed Science","","","","","","","","Language: English.","","","Fish, Fisheries & Aquatic Biodiversity Worldwide","","NISC South Africa","","","","","","chinook salmon; Climatology / climate change; Distribution / Biogeography; Ecology; Estuarine / Lagoon / Brackishwater environments; extinction models; fish; Mathematical models / Equations; population assessment; sacramentosan joaquin river delta; salmonids","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Increases in wildfire occurrence and severity under an altered climate can substantially impact terrestrial ecosystems through enhancing runoff erosion. Improved prediction tools that provide high resolution spatial information are necessary for location-specific soil conservation and watershed management. However, quantifying the magnitude of soil erosion and its interactions with climate, hydrological processes, and fire occurrences across a large region (>10,000km2) is challenging because of the large computational requirements needed to capture the fine-scale complexities of the land surface that govern erosion. We apply the physically-based coupled Variable Capacity Infiltration–Water Erosion Prediction Project (VIC–WEPP) model to study how wildfire occurrences can enhance soil erosion in a future climate over a representative watershed in the northern Rocky Mountains – the Salmon River Basin (SRB) in central Idaho. While the VIC model simulates hydrologic processes at larger scales, the WEPP model simulates erosion at the hillslope scale by sampling representative hillslopes.VIC–WEPP model results indicate that SRB streamflow will have an earlier shift in peak flow by one to two months under future climate scenarios in response to a declining snowpack under warming temperatures. The magnitude of peak flow increases with each higher severity fire scenario; and under the highest fire severity, the peak flow is shifted even earlier, exacerbating the effects of climate change. Similarly, sediment yield also increases with higher fire severities for both historical and future climates. Sediment yield is more sensitive to fire occurrence than to climate change by one to two orders of magnitude, which is not unexpected given that our fire scenarios were applied basin wide as worst case scenarios. In reality, fires only occur over portions of the basin in any given year and subsequent years’ vegetation regrowth reduces erosion. However, the effects of climate change on sediment yield result in greater spatial heterogeneities, primarily because of the spatial differences in precipitation projections, while fire conditions were uniformly applied. The combined effects of climate change and a possible continuation of increasing fire frequency and severity will compound excess sediment issues that already exist in this region of the intermountain West.","2016","2016-11-04 23:29:03","2016-11-04 23:29:03","","74–91","","","536","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","search.lib.uidaho.edu","","","","","","","Climate Change; Erosion; Hydrology; Wepp Model; Wildfire","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Farmers' forecasting knowledge encompasses shared and selective repertoires. Most farmers formulate expectations from observation of natural phenomena. Cultural and ritual spiritualists also predict rainfall from divination, visions, and dreams. Rather than positing local and scientific knowledge as self-exclusive, our research shows that farmers operate in multiple cognitive frameworks. Moreover, they are interested in receiving scientific information because they perceive local forecasts as becoming less reliable as a result of increasing climate variability. Some aspects of local forecasting knowledge, such as those stressing the relationship between temperatures, wind, and rainfall, can help explain meteorology-based forecasts. But significant discordance remains between scientific and local forecasts. The former predict total rainfall quantity at a regional scale, whereas the latter stress rainfall duration and distribution and are more attuned to crop-weather interactions. Local systems of thought stress the relationship between knowledge and social responsibility. This emphasizes the need for scientists to integrate information dissemination projects with efforts to improve farmers' capacity to respond to forecasts and to cope with suboptimal climate impacts.","2002","2016-03-17 18:08:57","2016-03-17 18:08:57","","409–427","","5","15","","","Reading the Rains","","","","","","","","","","","","Primo","","","","","","","Burkina Faso; Climate Variability; Environmental Indicators; Farmer Knowledge; Indigenous Meteorology; Seasonal Rainfall Forecasts","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The three focal services are greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation, nitrogen mitigation, and waterfowl recreation. Site- and region-level measurements of these ecosystem services are combined with process models to quantify their production on agricultural land, which serves as the baseline, and on restored wetlands. We adjust and transform these measures into per-hectare, valuation-ready units and monetize them with prices from emerging ecosystem markets and the environmental economics literature. By valuing three of the many ecosystem services produced, we generate lower bound estimates for the total ecosystem value of the wetlands restoration. Social welfare value is found to be between $1435 and $1486/ha/year, with GHG mitigation valued in the range of $171 to $222, nitrogen mitigation at $1248, and waterfowl recreation at $16. Limited to existing markets, the estimate for annual market value is merely $70/ha, but when fully accounting for potential markets, this estimate rises to $1035/ha. The estimated social value surpasses the public expenditure or social cost of wetlands restoration in only 1 year, indicating that the return on public investment is very attractive for the WRP. Moreover, the potential market value is substantially greater than landowner opportunity costs, showing that payments to private landowners to restore wetlands could also be profitable for individual landowners.","2010","2016-04-27 03:48:43","2016-04-27 03:48:43","","1051–1061","","5","69","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","search.lib.uidaho.edu","","","","","","","Economic Valuation; Ecosystem Markets; ecosystem service; Market Value; Social Value; Wetlands Reserve Program","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Bull trout Salvelinus confluentus may be especially vulnerable to climate change given that spawning and early rearing are constrained by cold water temperatures creating a patchwork of natal headwater habitats across river networks. Because the size and connectivity of patches also appear to influence the persistence of local populations, climate warming could lead to increasing fragmentation of remaining habitats and accelerated decline of this species. We modeled the relationships between (1) the lower elevation limits of small bull trout and mean annual air temperature and (2) latitude and longitude across the species' potential range within the interior Columbia River basin of the USA. We used our results to explore the implications of the climate warming expected in the next 50 or more years. We found a strong association between the lower elevation limits of bull trout distributions and longitude and latitude; this association was consistent with the patterns in mean annual air temperature. We concluded that climate does strongly influence regional and local bull trout distributions, and we estimated bull trout habitat response to a range of predicted climate warming effects. Warming over the range predicted could result in losses of 18-92% of thermally suitable natal habitat area and 27-99% of large (> 10,000-ha) habitat patches, which suggests that population impacts may be disproportionate to the simple loss of habitat area. The predicted changes were not uniform across the species' range, and some populations appear to face higher risks than others. These results could provide a foundation for regional prioritization in conservation management, although more detailed models are needed to prioritize actions at local scales","2007-01-01","2017-02-21 22:50:26","2017-02-21 22:50:26","","1552-1565","","6","136","","American Fisheries Society.

It is based on (1) local scale observations along an Inner-Alpine river called Mur, (2) an IPCC emission scenario (IS92a), implemented by atmosphere-ocean global circulation model (AOGCM) ECHAM4/OPYC3, and (3) a model-chain that links climate research to hydrobiology. The Mur River is still in a near-natural condition and water temperature in summer is the most important aquatic ecological constraint for fish distribution. The methodological strategy is (1) to use downscaled air temperature and precipitation scenarios for the first half of the twenty-first century, (2) to establish a model that simulates water temperature by means of air temperature and flow rate in order to generate water temperature scenarios, and (3) to evaluate the impact on fish communities using an ecological model that is driven by water temperature. This methodology links the response of fish fauna to an IPCC emission scenario and is to our knowledge an unprecedented approach. The downscaled IS92a scenarios show increased mean air temperatures during the whole year and increased precipitation totals during summer, but reduced totals for the rest of the annual cycle. These changes result in scenarios of increased water temperatures, an altered annual cycle of flow rate, and, in turn, a 70 m displacement in elevation of fish communities towards the river's head. This would enhance stress on species that rely on low water temperatures and coerce cyprinid species into advancing against retreating salmonids. Hyporhithral river sectors would turn into epipotamal sectors. Grayling (Thymallus thymallus) and Danube salmon (Hucho hucho), presently characteristic for the Mur River, would be superceded by other species. Native brown trout (Salmo trutta), already now under pressure of competition, may be at risk of losing its habitat in favour of invaders like the exotic rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), which are better adapted to higher water temperatures. Projected changes in fish communities suggest an adverse influence on salmonid sport fishing and a loss in its high economic value","2007-01-01","2017-02-21 22:50:26","2017-02-21 22:50:26","","127-137","","2","52","","International Journal of Biometeorology","","","","","","","","Language: English.","","","Fish, Fisheries & Aquatic Biodiversity Worldwide","","NISC South Africa","","","","","","United States","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Often, out of convenience and availability rather than importance to the structure of the system being modeled, the environmental data used originate from a variety of sources and scales. To demonstrate the importance of appropriate environmental data selection, classifications of six‐digit hydrologic units (1:24,000) across selected geographic areas within the Interior Columbia River Basin were produced. Canonical correspondence analysis was used to select and test environmental variables important in predicting Rosgen stream types and valley bottom classes. Then, hierarchical agglomerative clustering was used to group (classify) watersheds based on these variables. Statistically significant results were derived from the use of organized classification data with presumed predictive relationships to watershed properties, and a random distribution of environmental variables from the same datasets provided similar results. The results contained herein demonstrate that these analysis techniques do not necessarily select meaningful variables from a broad spectrum of data and that significant results are easily generated from randomly associated data. It is suggested that classifications produced using these multivariate techniques, especially when using multi‐scale data or data of unknown significance, are subject to invalid inferences and should be used with caution.","2004","2016-02-28 22:27:58","2016-02-28 22:38:56","","1257–1268","","5","40","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Primo","","","","","","","Basin Morphometrics; Climate; Geographic Information Systems; Modeling; Multiscaled Data; Rosgen Stream Types; Statistical Analysis; Watershed Classification","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study demonstrates that stream thermal regimes in western Alberta, Canada, may only warm during the summer period, while colder thermal regimes during spring, fall, and winter could result from response to earlier onset of spring freshet. Model results of future climate impacts on hydrology and stream temperature are corroborated by an intercatchment comparison of stream temperature, air temperature, and hydrological conditions. Earlier fry emergence as a result of altered hydrological and thermal regimes may favour native westslope cutthroat trout ( Oncorhynchus clarkii lewisii) in isolated headwater streams.

With the aid of case-study data from Canada, it is argued that watersheds, as particular forms of rescaled environmental governance, have increased in popularity because of their status as boundary objects: that is, a common concept interpreted differently by different groups. The paper shows how particular features of the watershed approach—namely, their physical size and the shared discursive framings they employ (‘stakeholder’ and ‘integration’)—make the watershed concept both cohesive enough to travel among different epistemic communities, and plastic enough to be interpreted and used differently within them. As such, it is suggested that the trend of the uptake of the so-called ‘watershed approach’ reflects and is shaped by ideologies underpinned by three different, and occasionally competing, epistemic communities: the scientific, neoliberal, and grassroots communities. These arguments corroborate constructivist accounts of the political nature of boundary drawing, bring science into discussion on the relationship between neoliberalism and public participation, and contribute to environmental governance literatures by providing an alternative explanation for the uptake of watersheds in recent decades.","2012","2016-11-01 18:39:08","2016-11-01 18:39:08","","2207–2224","","9","44","","","Rescaling Environmental Governance","","","","","","","","","","","","search.lib.uidaho.edu","","","","","","","Boundary Object; Canada; Environmental Governance; Scale; Water; Watershed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In stream ecosystems, recent climate change has resulted in extreme variation in both thermal and hydrological regimes. From 2001 to 2004, a severe drought in western United States corresponded with earlier emergence of the adult stage of the high-altitude stream mayfly, Baetis bicaudatus. Using a long-term database from a western Colorado stream, the peak emergence date of this mayfly population was predicted by both the magnitude and date of peak stream flow, and by the mean daily water temperature, suggesting that Baetis may respond to declining stream flow or increasing water temperature as proximate cues for early metamorphosis. However, in a one-year survey of multiple streams from the same drainage basin, only water temperature predicted spatial variation in the onset of emergence of this mayfly. To decouple the effects of temperature and flow, we separately manipulated these factors in flow-through microcosms and measured the timing of B. bicaudatus metamorphosis to the adult stage. Mayflies emerged sooner in a warmed-water treatment than an ambient-water treatment; but reducing flow did not accelerate the onset of mayfly emergence. Nonetheless, using warming temperatures to cue metamorphosis enables mayflies to time their emergence during the descending limb of the hydrograph when oviposition sites (protruding rocks) are becoming available. We speculate that large-scale climate changes involving warming and stream drying could cause significant shifts in the timing of mayfly metamorphosis, thereby having negative effects on populations that play an important role in stream ecosystems","2006-01-01","2017-02-21 22:50:26","2017-02-21 22:50:26","","612-621","","2","16","","Ecological Applications","","","","","","","","Language: English.","","","Fish, Fisheries & Aquatic Biodiversity Worldwide","","NISC South Africa","","","","","","abiotic factors; Baetidae; Baetis bicaudatus; climate changes; climatology; Colorado; Distribution / Biogeography; droughts; east river; Ecology; emergences; environmental cues; environmental factors; fieldwork / field experiments / monitoring; Hydrology; insects; mayflies; North America; population structures; rivers / lakes; rocky mountains; streams; temporal variations; United States; water flows; water temperatures","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The GIS and statistical analyses were applied to land-surface form, geologic texture (permeability of the soil and bedrock), and climate variables that describe the physical and climatic setting of 43,931 small (approximately 200 km 2 ) watersheds in the United States. (The term “watersheds” is defined in this paper as the drainage areas of tributary streams, headwater streams, and stream segments lying between two confluences.) The analyses grouped the watersheds into 20 noncontiguous regions based on similarities in land-surface form, geologic texture, and climate characteristics. The percentage of explained variance (R-squared value) in an analysis of variance was used to compare the hydrologic-landscape regions to 19 square geometric regions and the 21 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency level-II ecoregions. Hydrologic-landscape regions generally were better than ecoregions at delineating regions of distinct land-surface form and geologic texture. Hydrologic-landscape regions and ecoregions were equally effective at defining regions in terms of climate, land cover, and water-quality characteristics. For about half of the landscape, climate, and water-quality characteristics, the R-squared values of square geometric regions were as high as hydrologic-landscape regions or ecoregions.","2004","2016-02-28 22:19:36","2016-02-28 22:19:36","","S71–S88","","1","34","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","Primo","","","","","","","Cluster analysis; Hydrologic landscapes; Hydrologic regions; Network design","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

During outbreaks, the resulting widespread tree mortality reduces forest carbon uptake and increases future emissions from the decay of killed trees. The impacts of insects on forest carbon dynamics, however, are generally ignored in large-scale modelling analyses. The current outbreak in British Columbia, Canada, is an order of magnitude larger in area and severity than all previous recorded outbreaks. Here we estimate that the cumulative impact of the beetle outbreak in the affected region during 2000-2020 will be 270 megatonnes (Mt) carbon (or 36 g carbon m(-2) yr(-1) on average over 374,000 km2 of forest). This impact converted the forest from a small net carbon sink to a large net carbon source both during and immediately after the outbreak. In the worst year, the impacts resulting from the beetle outbreak in British Columbia were equivalent to approximately 75% of the average annual direct forest fire emissions from all of Canada during 1959-1999. The resulting reduction in net primary production was of similar magnitude to increases observed during the 1980s and 1990s as a result of global change. Climate change has contributed to the unprecedented extent and severity of this outbreak. Insect outbreaks such as this represent an important mechanism by which climate change may undermine the ability of northern forests to take up and store atmospheric carbon, and such impacts should be accounted for in large-scale modelling analyses.","2008","2016-11-04 23:29:03","2016-11-04 23:29:03","","987-90","","7190","452","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","search.lib.uidaho.edu","","","","","","","Beetles -- metabolism; Carbon -- metabolism; Ecosystem; Greenhouse Effect; Pinus -- metabolism; Trees -- metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To facilitate the use of this decision support framework, we mapped scenarios of future stream flow and temperature in the Pacific Northwest region and reviewed literature on habitat restoration actions to determine whether they ameliorate a climate change effect or increase life history diversity and salmon resilience. Under the climate change scenarios considered here, summer low flows decrease by 35–75% west of the Cascade Mountains, maximum monthly flows increase by 10–60% across most of the region, and stream temperatures increase between 2 and 6°C by 2070–2099. On the basis of our literature review, we found that restoring floodplain connectivity, restoring stream flow regimes, and re-aggrading incised channels are most likely to ameliorate stream flow and temperature changes and increase habitat diversity and population resilience. By contrast, most restoration actions focused on in-stream rehabilitation are unlikely to ameliorate climate change effects. Finally, we illustrate how the decision support process can be used to evaluate whether climate change should alter the types or priority of restoration actions in a salmon habitat restoration plan","2013-01-01","2017-02-21 22:50:27","2017-02-21 22:50:27","","939-960","","8","29","","River research and applications","","","","","","","","Language: English.","","","Fish, Fisheries & Aquatic Biodiversity Worldwide","","NISC South Africa","","","","","","cascade mountains; climate change effects; Climatology / climate change; Conservation / Preservation; fish; habitat restoration; life history; rivers / lakes; salmon habitat; stream flow; stream temperature","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Fully understanding their separate and combined effects requires a mechanistic understanding at the local scale where their effects are ultimately realized. Here we applied an individual-based model of fish population dynamics to evaluate the role of local stream variability in modifying responses of Coastal Cutthroat Trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii clarkii) to scenarios simulating identical changes in temperature and stream flows linked to forest harvest, climate change, and their combined effects over six decades. We parameterized the model for four neighboring streams located in a forested headwater catchment in northwestern Oregon, USA with multi-year, daily measurements of stream temperature, flow, and turbidity (2007-2011), and field measurements of both instream habitat structure and three years of annual trout population estimates. Model simulations revealed that variability in habitat conditions among streams (depth, available habitat) mediated the effects of forest harvest and climate change. Net effects for most simulated trout responses were different from or less than the sum of their separate scenarios. In some cases, forest harvest countered the effects of climate change through increased summer flow. Climate change most strongly influenced trout (earlier fry emergence, reductions in biomass of older trout, increased biomass of young-of-year), but these changes did not consistently translate into reductions in biomass over time. Forest harvest, in contrast, produced fewer and less consistent responses in trout. Earlier fry emergence driven by climate change was the most consistent simulated response, whereas survival, growth, and biomass were inconsistent. Overall our findings indicate a host of local processes can strongly influence how populations respond to broad scale effects of land use and climate change","2015-01-01","2017-02-21 22:50:26","2017-02-21 22:50:26","","ee0135334-ee0135334","","8","10","","PloS one","","","","","","","","Language: English.","","","Fish, Fisheries & Aquatic Biodiversity Worldwide","","NISC South Africa","","","","","","United States","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"IADHPQXN","journalArticle","2004","Cattanéo, Franck; Suren, Alastair M.","Is the River Environment Classification an Improved Landscape-Scale Classification of Rivers?","Journal of the North American Benthological Society","","0887-3593","","","Landscape classifications, such as ecoregions, are widely promoted as spatial frameworks for aquatic conservation and environmental management. The River Environment Classification (REC) is an alternative approach to landscape-scale river classification. The REC classifies individual sections of river networks according to the climate, topography, geology, and land cover of the unique upstream watershed of each section. The classification is hierarchical and is based on the assumption that climate, topography, geology, and land cover are dominant causes of spatial variation in physical and biological characteristics of rivers at 4 spatial scales. The ability of the REC to explain variation in invertebrate samples collected from 237 sites in New Zealand was compared to that of region-based classifications using classification strength tests. Classifications with differing numbers of classes were compared using relative classification strengths calculated by expressing absolute classification strength as a proportion of the classification strength reached by an a posteriori classification with the same number of classes. The a posteriori classifications were derived by clustering sites by their invertebrate assemblage, so the classifications were close to the maximum possible strength attainable for a set number of classes. The relative classification strength of the REC was compared with an existing ecoregion classification and with classes that were defined by clustering sites based on intersite distances. The relative classification strength of the REC was higher (>55% of maximum attainable) than the strengths of classifications based on ecoregions (45%) or distance-based classes (<47%) when presence/absence data were used. The relative classification strength of the REC also was higher (>28% of maximum atainable) than the strengths of classifications based on ecoregions (22%) or distance-basedt classes (<24%) when relative abundance data were used. The higher classification strength of the REC was attributed to its explicit consideration of the causes of spatial variation in ecological characteristics of rivers. In addition, the REC was more likely than ecoregion classification to differentiate among geographically close sites that had contrasting watershed conditions because the REC represented the network spatial structure of rivers. However, the classification strength of the REC was low, indicating that it provided a general representation of ecological patterns, but could not be used to predict assemblage characteristics reliably for a specific site.","2004","2016-02-28 22:16:17","2016-02-28 22:16:17","","580–598","","3","23","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","Primo","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using Henri Lefebvre's concepts of social space, this article reviews research to identify the varied political, social, and physical characteristics that watershed organizers confront in urbanized and rural areas. Planners working in watersheds with diverse settlement patterns may find it difficult to meet the guiding principles suggested by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) and National Research Council: organizing watershed partnerships to involve those most affected by management decisions, making decisions within a specific geographic area, and using science and data to guide decisions over time.","2005","2016-02-28 22:17:17","2016-02-28 22:17:17","","241–253","","3","18","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Primo","","","","","","","Collaboration; Land Use Planning; Spatial Scale; Watersheds","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Statistical analyses and modelling of rainfall and temperature were performed and contrasted with qualitative data collected through a semi-structured questionnaire. The fieldwork showed that farmers perceived regional climate to have changed in the past 20 years. In particular, farmers felt that temperature had increased and seasonality and variability had changed, with the first rainy season between March and May becoming more variable. Farmers reported detailed accounts of climate characteristics during specific years, with recent droughts in the late 1990s and late 2000s confirming local perceptions that there has been a shift in climate towards more variable conditions that are less favourable to production. There is a clear signal that temperature has been increasing in the climate data and, to a lesser extent, evidence that the reliability of rains in the first season has decreased slightly. However, rainfall measurements do not show a downward trend in rainfall amount, a significant shift in the intensity of rainfall events or in the start and end of the rainy seasons. We explore why there are some differences between farmers??? perceptions and the climate data due to different associations of risk between ideal rainfall by farmers, including the amount and distribution needed for production, meteorological definitions of normal rainfall or the long-term statistical mean and its variation, and the impact of higher temperatures. The paper reflects on the methodological approach and considers the implications for communicating information about risk to users in order to support agricultural innovation.","2011","2016-03-17 18:19:06","2016-03-17 18:19:06","","293–316","","2","47","","","SUPPORTING AGRICULTURAL INNOVATION IN UGANDA TO RESPOND TO CLIMATE RISK","","","","","","","","","","","","Primo","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Associated high-altitude streams will face significant hydrological changes that might affect population genetic diversity of lotic species. In a recent study of glacier-fed streams in the Pyrenees, Finn et al. ( 2013 ) predicted that a large proportion of regional genetic diversity of the mayfly Baetis alpinus would be lost as glacial meltwater sources disappear. We expanded the analysis of Finn et al. to include genetic data (mitochondrial barcoding region) collected from B. alpinus occupying recently deglaciated locations including multiple basins in 2 mountain ranges (Sierra Nevada and Picos de Europa) on the Iberian Peninsula and 1 additional, deglaciated Pyrenean basin. We hypothesized that regional genetic diversity at scales of entire mountain ranges (γ diversity) and population structure within ranges (β diversity) would be lower in recently deglaciated mountain ranges than in the still-glaciated Pyrenees. For 4 cryptic lineages of the B. alpinus species complex in 3 mountain ranges, we found significantly lower genetic diversity in recently deglaciated than glaciated regions. β and γ genetic diversity were correlated, suggesting that population structure (β) strongly influences total regional diversity. Results support the hypothesis of Finn et al. ( 2013 ) that disappearance of alpine glaciers will result in substantial loss of genetic diversity. The distinctive hydrological environment created by glacial meltwater might drive an interaction between reproductive barriers (between highly and minimally glacier-influenced reaches within basins) and physical barriers (isolating highly glacier-influenced reaches among basins) that amplifies regional genetic diversity in mountain ranges still containing alpine glaciers","2014-01-01","2017-02-21 22:50:26","2017-02-21 22:50:26","","207-216","","1","33","","Freshwater Science","","","","","","","","Language: English.","","","Fish, Fisheries & Aquatic Biodiversity Worldwide","","NISC South Africa","","","","","","Climatology / climate change; genetic data; genetic diversity; Genetics / Strains / Stock identification; glacial meltwater sources; hydrological changes; hydrological environment; Hydrology; insects; physical barriers; population structure; pyrenees; rivers / lakes; Snow / Ice","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Consequently, there is value in investigating the connectivity of populations of species inhabiting different environments in order to evaluate dispersal as a potential strategy for persistence in the face of climate change. Here, we begin to investigate the processes that shape genetic variation within American pika populations from the northern periphery of their range, the central Coast Mountains of British Columbia, Canada. At these latitudes, pikas inhabit sharp elevation gradients ranging from sea level to 1500 m, providing an excellent system for studying the effects of local environmental conditions on pika population genetic structure and gene flow. We found low levels of neutral genetic variation compared to previous studies from more southerly latitudes, consistent with the relatively recent post-glacial colonization of the study location. Moreover, significant levels of inbreeding and marked genetic structure were detected within and among sites. Although low levels of recent gene flow were revealed among elevations within a transect, potentially admixed individuals and first generation migrants were identified using discriminant analysis of principal components between populations separated by less than five kilometers at the same elevations. There was no evidence for historical population decline, yet there was signal for recent demographic contractions, possibly resulting from environmental stochasticity. Correlative analyses revealed an association between patterns of genetic variation and annual heat-to-moisture ratio, mean annual precipitation, precipitation as snow and mean maximum summer temperature. Changes in climatic regimes forecasted for the region may thus potentially increase the rate of population extirpation by further reducing dispersal between sites. Consequently, American pika may have to rely on local adaptations or phenotypic plasticity in order to survive predicted climate changes, although additional studies are required to investigate the evolutionary potential of this climate change sensitive species.","2012","2016-11-04 23:29:03","2016-11-04 23:29:03","","","","6","7","","","Genetic Evidence for Restricted Dispersal along Continuous Altitudinal Gradients in a Climate Change-Sensitive Mammal","","","","","","","","","","","","search.lib.uidaho.edu","","","","","","","Biology; Earth Sciences; Research Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This tradeoff is intensified in alpine environments, which are characterized by cold and variable conditions. We monitored the incubation rhythms of alpine Horned Larks (  Eremophila alpestris  ) in British Columbia, Canada, across different annual thermal regimes (2005: moderate; 2006: warm; 2010: cold overnight; 2011: cold during the day). In this species, females alone incubated and left their nests to forage at dawn, following 7 hr of nighttime incubation in near-freezing conditions. However, with early morning ambient temperatures still <5°C, this placed embryos at high risk of chilling during incubation recesses. Focusing on behavioral decisions made by females at dawn (06:00–08:00 hours), we examined relationships between incubation rhythms and ambient temperature among years for evidence of variable responses to temperature. In all years, females spent more time off the nest at dawn in warmer temperatures, but in 2010, which was colder overnight, the slope of the line relating attentiveness to ambient temperature was steeper, indicating that females left their nests at colder temperatures compared with other years. In 2010 females also took shorter recesses at cold temperatures. Hatching success remained high in 2010 relative to warm or moderate years; however, overwinter survival of females declined to 48% from 2010 to 2011 compared with 72% in earlier years. When faced with exceptional thermal constraints, alpine Horned Larks made behavioral adjustments to their incubation rhythms and were able to maintain fecundity. However, potential survival costs to females implies a shift in balance of the parent–offspring tradeoff, revealing limits to coping mechanisms of alpine-breeding Horned Larks","2014-01-01","2017-02-21 22:50:25","2017-02-21 22:50:25","","495-506","","4","131","","The Auk: a quarterly journal of ornithology","","","","","","","","Language: English.","","","Fish, Fisheries & Aquatic Biodiversity Worldwide","","NISC South Africa","","","","","","ambient temperature; Behaviour / Psychology; Birds; Climatology / climate change; Ecology; horned lark; nest attentiveness; parent offspring trade off; Reproduction / Reproductive aspects; survival","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The tools feature spatial multicriteria analysis as the means to make spatially explicit trade-offs between stakeholder objectives in three different ways: as colors on multiple printed maps, qualitatively on a single digital map and quantitatively on a single digital map. An interactive mapping device is used as the interface between spatial information and participants. A series of controlled experiments was conducted with 30 participants, who were asked to use the tools and perform specific individual and group allocation tasks. Data on the responses of the participants were collected through questionnaires, observer notes, video film and multicriteria scores. The analysis focused on three aspects of effectiveness: usefulness of the tools; clarity of tool information; and impact on decisions. The findings of this analysis are discussed within the context of the information offered by the tools, individual and collaborative work of participants and the spatial and numerical quality of the resulting land use plans. From the experiments, it is clear that the cognitive effort related to the volume and format of information is a critical issue in spatial decision support. This holds true for both the level of detail per item of information and the amount of information to be supplied to the participants. Although the quantitative tool provided the most information, the participants did not consider this tool the most useful and it did not produce the best results.","2013-01","2016-11-04 22:40:11","2016-11-04 22:40:11","2016-11-04 22:40:11","159-175","","","39","","Environmental Modelling & Software","Effectiveness of collaborative map-based decision support tools","Thematic Issue on the Future of Integrated Modeling Science and Technology","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\coope\AppData\Roaming\Zotero\Zotero\Profiles\istgp9md.default\zotero\storage\8EUR28K3\S1364815212000801.html","","","Collaborative decision support; GIS; Land Use Planning; MCA; Support information; Tool effectiveness","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Given the long-term nature of the multidisciplinary dataset, we are able to provide an overview of the complex interaction between streamflow and fish population dynamics drawing on previously published material as well as new data analyses. For autumn-spawning fishes like the Atlantic salmon, access to headwater reaches was directly related to streamflow during late October (when they ascend spawning tributaries), as well as the propensity of beaver dams in the stream (also a function of streamflow). Winter streamflow was positively correlated with egg survival, except when rain-on-snow conditions induced severe ice break-up events that likely caused the highest mortalities on record for salmon and other fishes. Juvenile recruitment was significantly influenced by density-dependent processes of growth and competition but further mediated by density-independent factors like winter flow. In spring, fry emergence was largely temperature-driven, although peaks in fry drift were sometimes synchronized with secondary discharge peaks and temperature. Tributaries like Catamaran Brook provide thermal refugia for coolwater fishes like salmon and trout during the summer when wide, shallow main-stem Atlantic rivers experience low discharge and high water temperatures that induce physiological and behavioural stress (i.e. > 23 °C). These phenomena are discussed in detail, especially in terms of how they may be compromised by future changes in hydrologic conditions resulting from predicted climate change scenarios","2013-01-01","2017-02-21 22:50:27","2017-02-21 22:50:27","","741-749","","5","27","","Hydrological Processes","","","","","","","","Language: English.","","","Fish, Fisheries & Aquatic Biodiversity Worldwide","","NISC South Africa","","","","","","atlantic salmon; beaver dams; catamaran brook; Climatology / climate change; Ecology; fieldwork / field experiments / monitoring; fish; fish population dynamics; Hydrology; hydrometeorological conditions; miramichi river; rivers / lakes; streamflow; trout; Watersheds / Catchments","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Contributing basin area explained the majority of spatial variation (R squared = 0.57-0.63) in coho salmon overwinter survival (range = 0.02-0.63), with highest survival rates observed in smaller headwater and intermittent streams. Other habitat attributes, including proportional pool area, percent exposed bedrock substrate, percent broadleaf canopy cover, and adult salmon carcass density, were relatively poor predictors of survival. Indices of individual fish condition, including fall part fork length, condition factor, and parasite infestation rates, were also relatively uninformative in coho salmon overwinter survival models. Coho salmon smolt length was primarily a function of length at the time of fall tagging, but stream type, contributing basin area (positive effect), thermal history (positive effect), and black spot infestation (i.e., trematode metacercariae; negative effect) were also important. The consistent, broad spatial gradients in overwinter survival observed in this study can help guide efforts designed to enhance coho salmon production in coastal streams and suggest that habitat protection, restoration, and enhancement strategies will be best guided by a whole-basin context","2009-01-01","2017-02-21 22:50:26","2017-02-21 22:50:26","","564-580","","3","138","","American Fisheries Society.

Climate change and intensive agriculture are likely to have major effects on fish populations in temperate zones, yet understanding of the interactions between temperature and chemical stressors on fish physiology is limited. The objective of this study was to compare the stress responses of the Mountain Whitefish, (<i>Prosopium williamsoni</i>, a cold-water fish) and White Sucker (<i>Catostomus commerson</i>i, a cool-water fish), along a temperature and pesticide gradient in the Oldman River, Southern Alberta in spring and summer. Fish were seined, placed into an enclosure, and plasma cortisol, glucose, liver glycogen, and condition factor were measured. Plasma acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was used as an indicator of exposure to organophosphate and carbamates pesticides. Whitefish had lower plasma AChE activity and lower liver glycogen reserves compared to suckers at all sites and all sampling times but the differences in plasma cortisol were not species-specific and there were no differences in plasma glucose levels, except at one site. Plasma cortisol increased, and plasma glucose decreased along a downstream river gradient in whitefish in both spring and summer; in sucker only plasma cortisol fluctuated and only in the summer. Liver glycogen decreased along the river gradient in both species at both seasons. Our study detected important species-specific differences in AChE activities and responses of the physiological stress axis, suggesting that whitefish are more sensitive to temperature and pesticide stress than suckers.</div> </div>","2010-01-01","2017-02-21 22:50:26","2017-02-21 22:50:26","","119-131","","2","88","","Environmental Biology of Fishes","","","","","","","","Language: English.","","","Fish, Fisheries & Aquatic Biodiversity Worldwide","","NISC South Africa","","","","","","ache [acetylcholinesterase]; cortisol; Ecology; environmental stressors; fish; glycogen; mountain whitefish; oldman river; pesticides; Physiology / Biology; Pollution / Contamination; stress responses; temperature effects; white sucker","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we consider public perceptions of changes in average rainfall in India, analyzing the relationship between perceptions and the instrumental record. Using data from a national sample survey, we find that local instrumental records of precipitation are a strong predictor of perceived declines in rainfall. Perceptions of decreasing rainfall were also associated with perceptions of changes in extreme weather events, such as decreasing frequency of floods and severe storms, increasing frequency of droughts, and decreasing predictability of the monsoon. Higher social vulnerability—including low perceived adaptive capacity and greater food and livelihood dependence on local weather—was also associated with perceptions of decreasing rainfall. While both urban and rural respondents were likely to perceive local changes in precipitation, we show that rural respondents in general were more sensitive to actual changes in precipitation. Individual perceptions of changes in local climate may play an important role in shaping vulnerability to global climate change, adaptive behavior, and support for adaptation and mitigation policies. Awareness of local climate change is therefore particularly important in regions where much of the population is highly exposed and sensitive to the impacts of climate change.","2014","2016-03-05 15:11:10","2016-03-05 15:11:10","","211–225","","2","127","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","Primo","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To address this uncertainty, we evaluated the differences in model performance and interpretations of a species’ thermal niche when using different measures of stream temperature and surrogates for stream temperature. Specifically, we used a logistic regression modeling framework with three different indicators of stream thermal conditions (elevation, air temperature, and stream temperature) referenced to a common set of Brook Trout Salvelinus fontinalis distribution data from the Boise River basin, Idaho. We hypothesized that stream temperature predictions that were contemporaneous with fish distribution data would have stronger predictive performance than composite measures of stream temperature or any surrogates for stream temperature. Across the different indicators of thermal conditions, the highest measure of accuracy was found for the model based on stream temperature predictions that were contemporaneous with fish distribution data (percent correctly classified = 71%). We found considerable differences in inferences across models, with up to 43% disagreement in the amount of stream habitat that was predicted to be suitable. The differences in performance between models support the growing efforts in many areas to develop accurate stream temperature models for investigations of species’ thermal niches","2013-01-01","2017-02-21 22:50:26","2017-02-21 22:50:26","","793-801","","3","142","","American Fisheries Society.

Given the scope of the problem, it is imperative to rapidly assess vulnerability and identify actions to decrease risk. Although a variety of tools have been developed to assess climate change vulnerability, few have been evaluated with regard to their suitability for certain taxonomic groups. Due to their ectothermic physiology, low vagility, and strong association with temporary wetlands, reptiles and amphibians may be particularly vulnerable relative to other groups. Here, we evaluate use of the NatureServe Climate Change Vulnerability Index (CCVI) to assess a large suite of herpetofauna from the Sand Hills Ecoregion of the southeastern United States. Although data were frequently lacking for certain variables (e.g., phenological response to climate change, genetic variation), sufficient data were available to evaluate all 117 species. Sensitivity analyses indicated that results were highly dependent on size of assessment area and climate scenario selection. In addition, several ecological traits common in, but relatively unique to, herpetofauna are likely to contribute to their vulnerability and need special consideration during the scoring process. Despite some limitations, the NatureServe CCVI was a useful tool for screening large numbers of reptile and amphibian species. We provide general recommendations as to how the CCVI tool's application to herpetofauna can be improved through more specific guidance to the user regarding how to incorporate unique physiological and behavioral traits into scoring existing sensitivity factors and through modification to the assessment tool itself.","2015","2016-03-05 15:08:59","2016-03-05 15:08:59","","822–834","","4","56","","","Use of the NatureServe Climate Change Vulnerability Index as an Assessment Tool for Reptiles and Amphibians","","","","","","","eng","","","","","Primo","","","","","","","Amphibians; Biological Diversity; Climate Change; Reptiles; Reptiles & Amphibians; Sand Hills Ecoregion; Taxonomy; Vulnerability Assessments","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Peasant farmers perceive decreases in rainfall and increases in temperature as these factors are related to modifications in the corn planting season and the introduction of crops which were usually only found in hot regions. The climate changes in the zone are attributed to vegetation loss and the eruption of the Chichón volcano in 1982. The Zoque perception is structured according to cultural and individual experience, tied to agriculture and the annual weather calendar. The volcanic eruption offers a significant chronological reference point in order to explain different environmental transformations, such as climate, within Zoque territory. Perception is the mental picture of local climate variability changes and the responses in seasonal agriculture modifications, utilizing individual and cultural experiences which are vulnerable to economic and environmental change.","2011","2016-03-17 18:17:07","2016-03-17 18:17:07","","363–389","","3","107","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","Primo","","","","","","","changes in climate variability; chichón Volcano; climate knowledge; perceptions; Zoque indigenous","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It will also alter seasonal patterns of water availability and affect water quality and the health of aquatic ecosystems with various implications for social and economic wellbeing. Policy development for water resource adaptation needs to allow for a holistic and transparent analysis of the probable consequences of policy options for the wide variety of water uses and users, and the existing ecosystem services associated with any stream basin. This paper puts forward an innovative methodological framework for planning development-compatible climate policies drawing on multi-criteria decision analysis and an implicit risk-management approach to the economics of climate change. Its objectives are to describe how the generic methodology could be tailored for analysis of long-range water planning and policy options in developing countries, and to describe the place of climate change considerations in water governance and planning processes. An experimental thought-exercise applying the methodology to water policy development in Yemen provides further insights on the complexity of water adaptation planning. It also highlights the value of conducting sensitivity analysis to explore the implications of multiple climate scenarios, and the importance of accounting for policy portfolios rather than individual policy options. Rather than constituting a tool that can generate clear measures of optimal solutions in the context of adaptation to uncertain climate futures, we find that this approach is best suited to supporting comprehensive and inclusive planning processes, where the focus is on finding socially acceptable paths forward.","2014","2016-04-07 04:33:39","2016-04-07 04:33:39","","289–308","","3","19","","","Water resource management and climate change adaptation","","","","","","","eng","","","","","Primo","","","","","","","Adaptability; adaptation; Adaptations; Anthropogenic Climate Changes; Anthropogenic Factors; AQ 00008; Available Water; Climate Change; Climates; CLIMATIC changes; Developing Countries; Drought and Floods; Droughts; Economics; ECOSYSTEMS; Effects of Pollution; ENA 02; Environment; Environmental Policy; Floods; Innovations; Issues in Sustainable Development; M2 556.16; M3 1010; Mechanical and Natural Changes; National Planning; Network design; Planning; Policies; Public Policy and Climate; Q5 08521; R2 23050; Resource Development; Runoff (556.16); Sensitivity Analysis; Socioeconomics; Stream; Streams; SW 5010; Toxicology & Environmental Safety; Water Management; Water Policy; Water Quality; Water Resources; Water Resources Management; Water Use; Yemen","","","","Miller, Kathleen","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Both species are susceptible to floods that can scour redds or kill fry, potentially decreasing population size the following summer. Winter (November–April) floods affect brook trout, and spring (May) floods affect rainbow trout. In this study, we applied a spatially distributed ecohydrologic model (RHESSys) to estimate how climate warming (+2°C and +4°C) and changes in precipitation are likely to impact flood flows in Sagehen Creek. Model estimates predict substantial changes in the temporal distribution of floods from spring to winter and an increase in the frequency and intensity of floods in both warming scenarios. Greater annual precipitation or precipitation intensity increases flood frequency but does not change the temporal distribution. Results show a seasonal shift from mostly spring floods under current conditions (54 spring and 12 winter flood-days) to almost entirely winter floods in the +4°C warming scenario (5 spring and 83 winter flood-days), which would disproportionately impact brook trout populations. Given that this change in the timing of floods would probably be combined with greater flood intensity and higher stream temperatures, we argue that warming will likely cause a long-term decline in brook trout abundance. Conversely, fewer spring floods and potentially decreased competition with brook trout are likely to have a positive impact on the abundance of rainbow trout in Sagehen Creek, although increases in precipitation intensity would negatively impact both species. A shift in the abundance of either species may impact recreational anglers and have resource management implications.</p>","2010-01-01","2017-02-21 22:50:26","2017-02-21 22:50:26","","1657-1664","","6","139","","American Fisheries Society.

In this study we look at changing environment within the Oldman River Basin and its impact on water quality and quantity. The cumulative effects include a decline in net water supplies, and declining quality resulting in increased risk of disease. Our data indicates that decreases in the rate of flow of water can result in sedimentation of bacterial contaminants within the water column. Water for ecosystems, urban consumption, recreation and distribution through irrigation is often drawn from water-holding facilities such as dams and weirs, and concern must be expressed over the potential for contaminate build-up and disproportionate potential of these structures to pose a risk to human and animal health.

For this purpose, the participation of stakeholders in the decision-making process is mandated by the European Union as a way of improving its perceived legitimacy and transparency. This paper reports on an analytical-deliberative process for selecting landslide risk mitigation measures in the town of Nocera Inferiore in southern Italy. The process was structured as a series of meetings with a group of selected residents and several parallel activities open to the public. The preparatory work included a literature/media review, semi-structured interviews carried out with key local stakeholders and a survey eliciting residents’ views on landslide risk management. The main point of departure in the design of this process was the explicit elicitation and structuring of multiple worldviews (or perspectives) among the participants with respect to the nature of the problem and its solution. Rather than eliciting preferences using decision analytical methods (e.g. utility theory or multi-criteria evaluation), this process built on a body of research—based on the theory of plural rationality—that has teased out the limited number of contending and socially constructed definitions of problem-and-solution that are able to achieve viability. This framing proved effective in structuring participants’ views and arriving at a compromise recommendation (not, as is often aimed for, a consensus ) on measures for reducing landslide risk. Experts played a unique role in this process by providing a range of policy options that corresponded to the different perspectives held by the participants.","2016","2016-10-13 13:06:43","2016-10-13 13:06:43","","45–68","","Supplement 1","81","","","Compromise not consensus","","","","","","","eng","","","","","search.lib.uidaho.edu","","","","","","","Clumsy solution; Consensus or compromise; Contested terrain; Participatory processes; Theory of plural rationality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A Floristic Quality Assessment Index (FQAI) is used to calibrate and refine the landscape and rapid assessments. The landscape assessment defined ecological condition of sites in terms of the degree of departure from reference standard condition (i.e., wetlands in predominantly forested settings). Criteria for condition categories were based on the literature or best professional judgment and resulted in more than half of the area of the resource being rated in high or the highest condition, while about 12% was rated in low condition. The rapid assessment adjusts the landscape assessment by accounting for the presence of Stressors and the ameliorating effects of a buffer. This resulted in a 38% decrease in the proportion of wetland area in the highest and high condition categories and almost quadrupled the area in low condition. Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analysis was used to evaluate 1) whether the results of the landscape and rapid assessments correspond to those from the more quantitative data in FQAI and 2) whether the condition categories established for the landscape and rapid assessments agree with those established using FQAI. CART results indicate that our initial delineation of condition categories for the landscape and rapid assessments should be more stringent. However, it appears that the rapid assessment does a better job of gauging the factors important to wetland condition, as measured by FQAI, than the landscape assessment. This work can serve as a template for wetland monitoring and assessment and reporting as required by the U.S. Clean Water Act. Overall, such monitoring provides information that can be used to target areas for attention or protection, prioritize sites for restoration, design restoration projects, and choose best management practices.","2007","2016-02-28 22:22:33","2016-02-28 22:22:33","","416–431","","3","27","","","Assessment of wetland condition","","","","","","","eng","","","","","Primo","","","","","","","ecological condition; wetland assessment; wetland monitoring","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Extended incubation recesses are an example of neglect, but they are often treated as outliers and largely overlooked in studies of incubation behavior. We studied incubation rhythms of Horned Larks ( Eremophila alpestris ) on Hudson Bay Mountain, British Columbia, Canada, during four breeding seasons. Incubation recesses averaged 10.92 ± 0.38 min ( N = 4076 2-h periods), but we observed 70 extended recesses, ranging from 59 to 387 min in duration, at 35 nests. Although rare (<1% of all daytime recesses), extended recesses occurred in all 4 yr, were longer and more frequent in colder years (60% occurred in the two coldest years), and often occurred during inclement weather (39% occurred during three storm events). Extended recesses did not appear to compensate for long attendance periods because extended recess duration was not correlated with the duration of previous on-bouts ( P = 0.10, N = 70) or the mean on-bout duration of the previous 2-h period ( P = 0.36, N = 70). Rather, extended recesses seemed to reflect a shift in parental investment away from their eggs and toward self-maintenance when faced with energetically stressful conditions. Extended recesses may have reduced embryo viability; egg-hatching rates were 91 ± 2.4% for nests where females did not take extended recesses and 81 ± 4.2% for nests where females did take extended recesses ( P = 0.02, N = 56 nests). Extended recesses during incubation are rare events, but they may represent an important mechanism that allows birds to breed successfully in energetically challenging conditions","2013-01-01","2017-02-21 22:50:26","2017-02-21 22:50:26","","58-68","","1","84","","Journal of Field Ornithology","","","","","","","","Language: English.","","","Fish, Fisheries & Aquatic Biodiversity Worldwide","","NISC South Africa","","","","","","Behaviour / Psychology; Birds; Climatology / climate change; egg neglect; hudson bay mountain; incubation behaviour; incubation rhythms; nest desertion; parent offspring trade off; Reproduction / Reproductive aspects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Differences among groups accounted for 29.2% of the genetic variation. Although we observed major genetic differences between coastal and inland groups (10.7%), which are currently considered to represent the major phylogenetic division in the species, we found that the greatest evolutionary divergence (19.7%) was related to persistence of three major river systems: the upper Sacramento, Klamath, and Columbia rivers. Genetic traits of redband trout from the northern Great Basin, where we found distinct subspecies or races, indicated that over millennia these pluvial habitats were sources of evolutionary diversity associated with large river systems rather than completely isolated refugia. However, redband trout did not constitute a distinct monophyletic group. Based on our data, redband trout of the Goose Lake, Warner Valley, and Chewaucan basins were distinct genetic races that were part of the diverse complex of Sacramento redband trout O. mykiss stonei. Harney Basin redband trout were a unique genetic race most closely associated with Columbia River redband trout O. mykiss gairdneri. White River and Fort Rock redband trout were associated with the Columbia River but showed allelic divergence comparable with that among other subspecies. Upper Klamath Lake rainbow trout included a previously unrecognized group associated with populations in the headwaters of the basin and a different subspecies from type locations for Upper Klamath Lake redband trout O. mykiss newberrii (i.e., Upper Klamath Lake and the upper Klamath River).

Here we provide information on how these factors may affect the behavior and detectability of the Short-toed Snake-Eagle ( Circaetus gallicus ). We observed passage of Short-toed Snake-Eagles at two watchsites along mountain chains in northeastern Greece (Mount Olympus) and northwestern Italy ( Arenzano) during the peak periods of migration in autumn 2009 and spring 2010. More Short-toed Snake-Eagles were observed in spring than in autumn; this difference was more evident at Arenzano. Temperatures influenced the number of migrants observed. In particular, the number of individuals observed decreased drastically when temperatures were higher than 24°C during post-reproductive movements. At both sites, daily patterns showed a lower proportion of raptors observed during midday and early afternoon in autumn than in spring. These results suggest that, during autumn, individuals may pass undetected by flying at higher altitudes during midday and in early afternoon at both sites. The lack of difference in number of eagles observed during westerly (lateral) winds compared to other wind directions at Mount Olympus suggests that these birds may be able to compensate for drift effect toward the Aegean Sea.

The question that needs to be addressed is how farmers perceive drought. Insight into farmers’ perceptions of drought could be the missing link towards increased and sustainable production. During the period from 2004 to 2006, a study was conducted in Goima Ward, Tanzania. The study included questionnaires with mainly open-ended questions ( N=120), in-depth interviews, group discussions, field visits, picture assignment and 1-day seminar with farmers, extension workers, government officials, and scientists. Farmers saw drought in a broader perspective than that of deficient rainfall. Drought indicators were area-specific. Farmers recognized differences in drought vulnerability between soil types, location and state of land, land management practices and farmer types. Farmers perceived an increased drought risk. Farmers’ perceptions can be related to the scientific concept of agricultural drought. Since the amount of rainfall cannot be influenced, the efficiency of the rains can be a focal point for addressing farmers’ concerns about drought. Any viable strategy to reduce farmers’ vulnerability to drought and to improve productivity should be integrated into farmers’ existing strategies to adapt to and cope with ecological insecurity.","2008","2016-03-17 18:07:07","2016-03-17 18:07:07","","2106–2123","","11","72","","","“If only it would rain”","","","","","","","eng","","","","","Primo","","","","","","","Agricultural Drought; Belief; Environmental Perception; Knowledge; Risk; Vulnerability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, invertebrates make up the vast majority of global species richness, and the combined effects of climate change and land use on invertebrates remain poorly understood. Here we present 35 years of data on 159 species of butterflies from 10 sites along an elevational gradient spanning 0-2,775 m in a biodiversity hotspot, the Sierra Nevada Mountains of Northern California. Species richness has declined at half of the sites, with the most severe reductions at the lowest elevations, where habitat destruction is greatest. At higher elevations, we observed clear upward shifts in the elevational ranges of species, consistent with the influence of global warming. Taken together, these long-term data reveal the interacting negative effects of human-induced changes on both the climate and habitat available to butterfly species in California. Furthermore, the decline of ruderal, disturbance-associated species indicates that the traditional focus of conservation efforts on more specialized and less dispersive species should be broadened to include entire faunas when estimating and predicting the effects of pervasive stressors","2010-01-01","2017-02-21 22:50:26","2017-02-21 22:50:26","","2088-2092","","5","107","","National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.

The digital river networks, integrated with widely available digital elevation models, also need to have analytical capabilities to support resource management and conservation, including attributing river segments with key stream and watershed data, characterizing topography to identify landforms, discretizing land uses at scales necessary to identify human-environment interactions, and connecting channels downstream and upstream, and to terrestrial environments. We investigate the completeness and analytical capabilities of national to regional scale digital river networks that are available in five countries: Canada, China, Russia, Spain, and United States using actual resource management and conservation projects involving 12 university, agency, and NGO organizations. In addition, we review one pan-European and one global digital river network. Based on our analysis, we conclude that the majority of the regional, national, and global scale digital river networks in our sample lack in network completeness, analytical capabilities or both. To address this limitation, we outline a general framework to build as complete as possible digital river networks and to integrate them with available digital elevation models to create robust analytical capabilities (e.g., virtual watersheds). We believe this presents a global opportunity for in-country agencies, or international players, to support creation of virtual watersheds to increase environmental problem solving, broaden access to the watershed sciences, and strengthen resource management and conservation in countries worldwide.","2015-12-08","2016-06-09 22:29:23","2016-06-09 22:29:23","2016-06-09 22:29:23","722-739","","3","57","","Environmental Management","Building Virtual Watersheds","","","","","","","en","","","","","link.springer.com","","","","C:\Users\coope\AppData\Roaming\Zotero\Zotero\Profiles\istgp9md.default\zotero\storage\IQF447PJ\s00267-015-0634-6.html","","","Atmospheric Protection/Air Quality Control/Air Pollution; Conservation; Ecology; Environmental Management; Forestry Management; Landscape analysis; Modeling; Nature Conservation; Resource management; Waste Water Technology / Water Pollution Control / Water Management / Aquatic Pollution; Watersheds","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"VIU89RVI","journalArticle","2011","Perch, Leisa; Labbate, Gabriel","Dimensions of Inclusive Development","IDEAS Working Paper Series from RePEc","","","","","Growth, Equity and Sustainability: A Declaration of Interdependence Over one billion of us live without many of the basics that the other six billion take as given. Although 28 countries have moved from low-income status to middle-income status, with Ghana and Zambia among the newest Middle Income Countries, an estimated 800 million people still live in low-income countries. Of these, half live in just five countries, three of which are in sub-Saharan Africa. In these least-developed countries (LDCs), conflict, disaster and broader human insecurity impose structural limits on efforts to move from crisis to risk reduction and from growth to sustained development. So although many millions have been lifted out of poverty in the last ten years, it is also true that more people live in chronic hunger than ever before. Significant and sustained progress will require faster and better efforts. The message of this Poverty in Focus is that, ?For Growth to be inclusive, it must be sustained and sustainable and that, for it to be sustained and sustainable, it must also be equitable.? As a contribution to the dialogue around Rio+20 and to the ongoing discussions around a post-2015 MDG Agenda, this Poverty in Focus links future development to sustainability and particularly to social sustainability. Looking beyond the critical issues of ?carbon footprints?, ?low-carbon development?,? green economy? and the economics behind saving the planet, it draws attention back to the continuing challenge of ensuring that growth and development deliver for the poor and vulnerable. In its many forms?energy poverty, lack of access to water and sanitation, malnutrition or insecure access to food, and lack of access to education and health?the scale and scope of global deprivation call current development policy and practice into question. Growth, gender, poverty and the environment can no longer be treated as loosely connected components of development. Recognizing their interdependence is at the core of improved and sustained development for all. For one thing, the continuing decline of the quantity and quality of natural resources and of ecosystem functions is likely to exacerbate the likelihood of conflict over resources, particularly water. According to UNDP?s Bureau for Crisis Prevention and Recovery, 35 countries had entered what could be designated a ?post-conflict phase? by 2008. The cost of conflict has been enormous, matching or surpassing, according to some estimates, the value of ODA received in the last 20 to 30 years in the same countries. Addressing topics such as the evolving debate on environmental and social justice and improved accounting frameworks to ?include? environmental assets and services in considerations of growth, the enclosed articles can help us go beyond lip-service to the notion of sustainability. They focus on the ?software? components of development, highlighting the need for equal attention to process and to results. Suggesting that inclusive and sustainable development will need to leverage ?social technologies? such as political innovations, true engagement and honest evaluation, they make a clear case for a strong, representative state and the complementary roles of civil society and the private sector in defining and achieving sustained and sustainable development. They underscore the role of formal and informal mechanisms in the negotiation and reconciliation of conflicting and competing interests. In view of the high expectations placed on the next year?s Rio+20 meeting, let us remind ourselves that ?social sustainability? will be built on the foundations of productive and social inclusion. Too often, the focus has fallen largely on productive inclusion, with limited effort to address the structural factors that cause and sustain exclusion and marginalization, be they related to gender, political processes, property rights for the poor, and so on. Moreover, a focus on ?sustained? development as well as sustainable development acknowledges that, for many countries, existing development gains are fragile and easily reversed. The acute challenges faced by countries in the Horn of Africa due to persistent drought, displacement, conflict and poverty are a case in point. A socially sustainable approach, say these authors, is one in which policy efforts do not shy away from the many interdependent multiple dynamics, processes and situations that affect vulnerability and predispose the poor and the vulnerable to harm from shocks and change. Growth, equity and sustainability are mutually compatible, if efforts have enough time and resources, are responsive to underlying structural causes and encourage the vigorous participation of the poor, allowing them to define their futures. What follows illuminates the complexity of inclusiveness as a development outcome and highlights bold action in and by the South. We hope that these articles serve as a source of further innovation and inspire more cooperation and the spread of knowledge within the South. Ours is an age of political convulsions, global economic shifts, inexorable climatic change and stubborn poverty. Informed and catalytic strategies are needed now more than ever before. by Olav Kjorven, Assistant Administrator and Director of the Bureau for Policy Development, UNDP","2011","2016-04-07 04:29:40","2016-04-07 04:29:40","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","Primo","","","","","","","Ideas.Repec.Org/P/Ipc/Ifocus/23.Html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Individual populations evolved distinct life history characteristics in response to the diverse environments in which they were isolated after the last glaciation. Anthropogenic activities have resulted in a substantial decline (42% of the historical range is currently occupied; 28% is occupied by core [genetically unaltered] populations), but the number of extant populations, especially in headwater streams, has precluded listing of this taxon under the Endangered Species Act. Primary threats to persistence of Yellowstone cutthroat trout include (1) invasive species, resulting in hybridization, predation, disease, and interspecific competition; (2) habitat degradation from human activities such as agricultural practices, water diversions, grazing, dam construction, mineral extraction, grazing, timber harvest, and road construction; and (3) climate change, including an escalating risk of drought, wildfire, winter flooding, and rising temperatures. Extirpation of individual populations or assemblages has led to increasing isolation and fragmentation of remaining groups, which in turn raises susceptibility to the demographic influences of disturbance (both human and stochastic) and genetic factors. Primary conservation strategies include (1) preventing risks associated with invasive species by isolating populations of Yellowstone cutthroat trout and (2) connecting occupied habitats (where possible) to preserve metapopulation function and the expression of multiple life histories. Because persistence of isolated populations may be greater in the short term, current management is focused on isolating individual populations and restoring habitats; however, this approach implies that humans will act as dispersal agents if a population is extirpated because of stochastic events","2011-01-01","2017-02-21 22:50:26","2017-02-21 22:50:26","","782-812","","5","31","","North American Journal of Fisheries Management","","","","","","","","Language: English.","","","Fish, Fisheries & Aquatic Biodiversity Worldwide","","NISC South Africa","","","","","","anthropogenic activities; conservation strategies; Ecology; fish; life history characteristics; Physiology / Biology; Policy / Management; resource management; snake river; yellowstone river","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Relatively little is known about hydrograph (shape, peak flow) influence or the relative importance of chronic and episodic hillslope inputs on channel conditions. To better understand these external drivers, we calculated sediment routing through a gravel-bedded river network using a one-dimensional ( 1D) bedload transport model. We calculated changes in grain sizes and estimated Chinook salmon habitat suitability caused by a dry year and an extreme flood hydrograph, and chronic (diffusive, overland flow) or pulse (landslide, debris flow) hillslope sediment supplies. To obtain accurate channel conditions, a relatively high reference Shields stress, representative of steep mountain streams, was needed. An extreme event flood without any hillslope sediment inputs caused widespread bed coarsening and a decrease in aquatic habitat. Chronic sediment input combined with this hydrograph eliminated any changes in grain size and habitat, although when combined with a dry year flow, caused systematic bed fining. The influence of a given hydrograph therefore highly depends on the hillslope sediment supply. Regardless of the flow hydrograph or sediment pulse timing, grain size distribution or location, pulse sediment inputs did not cause widespread grain size changes despite being 100 times the total chronic input volume. Widespread and continuous hillslope sediment inputs may influence channel grain sizes and aquatic habitat more than a single discrete sediment pulse. Depending on the magnitudes of flow hydrograph and sediment supply alterations, climate change may induce no differences in grain sizes or very dramatic changes with significant consequences for long-term sustainability","2013-01-01","2017-02-21 22:50:26","2017-02-21 22:50:26","","1822-1837","","15","38","","Earth Surface Processes and Landforms","","","","","","","","Language: English.","","","Fish, Fisheries & Aquatic Biodiversity Worldwide","","NISC South Africa","","","","","","aquatic habitats; Climatology / climate change; endangered fish; fish; hydrographs; Hydrography; numerical simulations; rivers / lakes; Sediment / Soils / Soil quality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We propose an integrated strategy involving three approaches. The first is to make assessments of the ecosystem services provided by wetlands more routine. The second is to adopt the ""settings"" approach, most developed in health promotion, wherein wetlands are one of the settings for human health and provide a context for health policies. Finally, a layered suite of health issues in wetland settings is developed, including core requirements for human health (food and water); health risks from wetland exposures; and broader social determinants of health in wetland settings, including livelihoods and lifestyles. Together, these strategies will allow wetland managers to incorporate health impact assessment processes into their decisionmaking and to examine the health consequences of trade-offs that occur in planning, investment, development, and decisionmaking outside their direct influence.","2011","2016-04-27 03:48:43","2016-04-27 03:48:43","","678–688","","9","61","","","Wetlands as Settings for Human Health","","","","","","","eng","","","","","search.lib.uidaho.edu","","","","","","","AQ 00001; Assessments; D 04060; Ecological Effects; Ecosystem Disturbance; ENA 02; Environment; Environmental Quality; Evaluation Process; Food; Foods; H 6000; Health Policy; Health Promotion; Investment; Issues in Sustainable Development; Law, Policy, Economics and Social Sciences; M3 1010; Management and Conservation; Natural Disasters/Civil Defense/Emergency Management; Public Health; Q1 08121; R2 23050; Risk Assessment; SW 4020; Toxicology & Environmental Safety; Water Management; Water Resources; Water Resources and Supplies; Water Resources Management; Wetlands","","","","Horwitz, Pierre","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We measured soil CO2 efflux and soil temperature and moisture in two 20 m x 20 m plots from June 1998 to August 1999. The Q 10 values calculated from soil temperature at 10-cm depth ranged spatially from 1.21 to 2.63 among 18 chamber locations in the plots. Seasonally, the Q 10 values calculated on the basis of the average soil CO2 efflux and temperature (10 cm) across the sites could vary from 1.05 to 2.3. Q 10 and soil temperature are negatively correlated through a simple linear relationship with R2 values of 0.45, 0.40, and 0.54 for soil temperature at 5-, 10-, and 20-cm depth, respectively. However, Q 10 and soil moisture are positively correlated with R2 values of 0.81, 0.86, and 0.51 for soil temperature at 5-, 10-, and 20-cm depth, respectively. Q 10 values derived from temperatures at different soil depths also showed considerable variation along the vertical dimension. Q 10 had a large seasonal variation with the annual minimum occurring in midsummer and the annual maximum occurring in winter. Seasonal values of Q 10 depended closely on both soil temperature and moisture. Soil temperature and moisture explained 93% of the seasonal variation in Q 10. The spatial variation of Q 10 had significant influences on the estimation of soil CO2 efflux of the ecosystem. These variations tended to affect the seasonality of the soil CO2 efflux more than the annual average. The variations of Q 10 and its dependence on soil moisture and temperature have important implications for regional and global ecosystem carbon modelling, in particular for predicting the responses of terrestrial ecosystems to future global warming","2001-01-01","2017-02-21 22:50:27","2017-02-21 22:50:27","","687-696","","3","15","","Global Biogeochemical Cycles","","","","","","","","Language: English.","","","Fish, Fisheries & Aquatic Biodiversity Worldwide","","NISC South Africa","","","","","","california; co2 [carbon dioxide]; Ecology; fieldwork / field experiments / monitoring; Forest environments; global warming; Macrophytes / Plants; Montane environments; North America; ponderosa pines; seasonal variations; sierra nevada mountains; soil moisture; soil respiration; temperature; United States","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Spain), comparing censuses made at the same locations in the 1980s and during 2008–2012. Censuses were made in three representative ecosystems: 1) Pyrenean oak woodland, 2) high-mountain juniper scrubland, 3) high-mountain summits. In a global change context, avian-community dynamics are related mainly to changes in two of the following drivers: climate change and land-use change occurring over the past 30 years. Our results show a continuous turnover of the bird community, with an overall 27% change in species composition, in an ecological setting that has changed little, especially in the high-mountain scrubland and summit areas. We detected an increase in species diversity relative to the 1980s, mostly in the Pyrenean oak woodland. Moreover, our results also show a sharp decrease in bird density during the 30-year study period, chiefly affecting the dominant species of the 1980s in the Pyrenean oak forest and in the high-mountain scrubland. In the high-summit ecosystems, the decline of alpine species has paralleled the uphill expansion of some mediterranean ones. The outcome of these processes is a community in continuous flux, both in composition and abundance, where interannual variability is similar to interdecadal variability. We conclude that the bird communities of Sierra Nevada are showing strong spatial and temporal dynamics that are now accelerating, perhaps because of global warming","2015-01-01","2017-02-21 22:50:26","2017-02-21 22:50:26","","3-18","","1","62","","Ardeola","","","","","","","","Language: English.","","","Fish, Fisheries & Aquatic Biodiversity Worldwide","","NISC South Africa","","","","","","avian population dynamics; Birds; Climatology / climate change; elevational gradient; fieldwork / field experiments / monitoring; juniper scrubland; Landscapes / Landscape ecology; land use changes; mountain summits; oak woodland","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The intent is to develop an approach that is more practical in terms of data and analysis requirements than current approaches, informed by the literature and experience with probability elicitation and judgmental forecasting. The context involves decisions about managing forest lands that have been severely affected by mountain pine beetles in British Columbia, a pest infestation that is climate‐exacerbated. A forest management decision was developed as the basis for the context, objectives, and alternatives for land management actions, to frame and condition the judgments. A wide range of climate forecasts, taken to represent the 10–90% levels on cumulative distributions for future climate, were developed to condition judgments. An elicitation instrument was developed, tested, and revised to serve as the basis for eliciting probabilistic three‐point distributions regarding the performance of selected alternatives, over a set of relevant objectives, in the short and long term. The elicitations were conducted in a workshop comprising 14 regional forest management specialists. We employed the concept of to help identify robust alternatives. We used extensive sensitivity analysis to explore the patterns in the judgments, and also considered the preferred alternatives for each individual expert. The results show that two alternatives that are more flexible than the current policies are judged more likely to perform better than the current alternatives on average in terms of stochastic dominance. The results suggest judgmental approaches to robust decision making deserve greater attention and testing.","2012","2016-11-04 23:29:03","2016-11-04 23:29:03","","2098–2112","","12","32","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","search.lib.uidaho.edu","","","","","","","Climate Adaptation; Expert Elicitation; Forest Land Management; Mountain Pine Beetle; Robust Decision Making","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, the farmers in the study benefited from educational privileges and often-lucrative off-farm income, they expressed a desire to make their goods more accessible and affordable even as they marketed their foods to their upper-middle-class consumers, and they used their own idealism as justification to exploit their own difficult labor on the farm. Using a qualitative, ethnographic approach, this research explores the negotiations between farmers' social ideals and the actual practice of sustainable agriculture in a capitalist system.","2011-09-01","2016-02-16 19:09:39","2016-02-16 19:09:39","2016-02-16 19:09:39","375-393","","3","76","","","“The Only Thing That Isn't Sustainable . . . Is the Farmer”","","","","","","","en","Copyright © 2011, by the Rural Sociological Society","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","C:\Users\coope\AppData\Roaming\Zotero\Zotero\Profiles\istgp9md.default\zotero\storage\NZ8HMXBS\full.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The tools feature spatial multicriteria analysis as the means to make spatially explicit trade-offs between stakeholder objectives in three different ways: as colors on multiple printed maps, qualitatively on a single digital map and quantitatively on a single digital map. An interactive mapping device is used as the interface between spatial information and participants. A series of controlled experiments was conducted with 30 participants, who were asked to use the tools and perform specific individual and group allocation tasks. Data on the responses of the participants were collected through questionnaires, observer notes, video film and multicriteria scores. The analysis focused on three aspects of effectiveness: usefulness of the tools; clarity of tool information; and impact on decisions. The findings of this analysis are discussed within the context of the information offered by the tools, individual and collaborative work of participants and the spatial and numerical quality of the resulting land use plans. From the experiments, it is clear that the cognitive effort related to the volume and format of information is a critical issue in spatial decision support. This holds true for both the level of detail per item of information and the amount of information to be supplied to the participants. Although the quantitative tool provided the most information, the participants did not consider this tool the most useful and it did not produce the best results.","2013-01","2016-11-04 22:39:46","2016-11-04 22:39:46","2016-11-04 22:39:46","159-175","","","39","","Environmental Modelling & Software","Effectiveness of collaborative map-based decision support tools","Thematic Issue on the Future of Integrated Modeling Science and Technology","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\coope\AppData\Roaming\Zotero\Zotero\Profiles\istgp9md.default\zotero\storage\AWUBNG6G\S1364815212000801.html","","","Collaborative decision support; GIS; Land Use Planning; MCA; Support information; Tool effectiveness","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Field surveys to elicit farmers??? perceptions about climate variability and change were conducted in Machakos, Makueni, Kitui, Mwingi and Mutomo districts. Long-term rainfall records from five meteorological stations within a 10 km radius from the survey locations were obtained from the Kenya Meteorological Department and were analysed to compare with farmers??? observations. Farmers??? responses indicate that they are well aware of the general climate in their location, its variability, the probabilistic nature of the variability and the impacts of this variability on crop production. However, their ability to synthesize the knowledge they have gained from their observations and discern long-term trends in the probabilistic distribution of seasonal conditions is more subjective, mainly due to the compounding interactions between climate and other factors such as soil fertility, soil water and land use change that determine the climate's overall influence on crop productivity. There is a general tendency among the farmers to give greater weight to negative impacts leading to higher risk perception. In relation to long-term changes in the climate, farmer observations in our study that rainfall patterns are changing corroborated well with reported perceptions from other places across the African continent but were not supported by the observed trends in rainfall data from the five study locations. The main implication of our findings is the need to be aware of and account for the risk during the development and promotion of technologies involving significant investments by smallholder farmers and exercise caution in interpreting farmers??? perceptions about long-term climate variability and change.","2011","2016-03-17 18:10:11","2016-03-17 18:10:11","","267–291","","2","47","","","CLIMATE VARIABILITY AND CHANGE","","","","","","","","","","","","Primo","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We defined coastal regions to range from the continental shelf (to a depth of 200 m), the intertidal areas and adjacent land within 100 km of the coastline. We used the 1 km resolution Global Land Cover Characteristics Database and calculated the area covered by 11 different land cover classes (natural and human-altered ecosystems) within the 100 km limit [Burke, L., Kura, Y., Kasem, K., Revenga, C., Spalding, M., McAllister, D., 2001. Coastal Ecosystems. Washington DC World Resource Institute. 93 pp.]. Cover of aquatic ecosystems was calculated based on several world databases. Our results show that the coasts of the world comprise a wide variety of geomorphological characteristics of which mountainous coasts with a narrow shelf are the most abundant. Sandy shores are found on 16 percent of the coastal countries. The coasts are located in every weather regime and the number of biomes is equally variable. Within the 100 km limit, 72 percent still is covered by natural ecosystems and 28 eprcent have been altered by human activities (urban and croplands). Open shrubs and evergreen broadleaf forests are the most abundant terrestrial ecosystems. Canada has the largest area of natural and relatively well preserved terrestrial ecosystems. Indonesia and China have the largest percentages of cropland area near the shore, and Japan and the US have the largest coastal urban areas. Indonesia, Australia, Brazil, Bahamas and New Caledonia have the largest areas of aquatic ecosystems. The calculated economic value of goods and services provided by coastal ecosystems showed that altogether, coastal ecosystems contribute 77 percent of global ecosystem-services value calculated by Costanza et al. [Costanza, R., d'Arge, R., de Groot, R., Farber, S., Grasso, M., Hannon, B., Naeem, S., Limburg, K., Paruelo, J., O'Neill, R.V., Raskin, R., Sutton, P., ven den Belt, M., 1997. The value of the world's ecosystem services and natural capital. Nature 387, 253-260]. According to 2003 data, 2.385 million people live within the coastal limit, which represents 41 percent of world global population. More than 50 percent of the coastal countries have from 80 to 100 percent of their total population within 100 km of the coastline. Twenty-one of the 33 world's megacities are found on the coast. Multivariate analyses grouped coastal countries according to their ecological, economic and social characteristics. Three gradients explained 55 percent of the variance: degree of conservation, ecosystem service product and demographic trends. Given the current scenario and the climate change prediction, the coastal environments will be confronting serious environmental issues that should be worked in advance, in order to achieve a sustainable development of the most valued locations of the world.

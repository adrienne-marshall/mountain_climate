the last few decades indicates that glaciers throughout
western North America are out of equilibrium with the
current climate and, barring a shift to cooler and/or wetter

the next decade or so. --Hock et al. (2005) outlined the processes by which
mountain glacier discharge responds to climate warming
and a shift from near-neutral to negative mass balance.
They distinguished between a short-term response to
changes in climate and the extents of snow and firn, and a
long-term response, which includes the change in glacier

Many studies have identiﬁed widespread declines in snowpack in western North America [Mote et al., 2005; Hamlet et al., 2005; Mote, 2006], and these changes have been linked to warming trends [Pederson et al., 2011; Kapnick and Hall, 2012; Pederson et al., 2013] and increasing freezing level elevations [Abatzoglou, 2011]. Additionally, approximately half of recent changes in western U.S. snowpack have been attributed to anthropogenic eﬀects [Pierce et al., 2008].",very mountain focused.

Associated shifts in streamflow timing from spring and summer to winter are also evident in basins with significant snow accumulation in winter (for the current climate). Potential evapotranspiration increases over most of the PNW in summer because of rising temperatures; however, actual evapotranspiration is reduced in all but a few areas of the domain because evapotranspiration is mostly water limited in summer, and summer precipitation decreases in the simulations. Simulated widespread increases in soil moisture recharge in fall and winter in areas with significant snow accumulation in winter (for the current climate) support hypotheses of increased landslide risk and sediment transport in winter in the future. Simulations of floods and extreme low flows increase in intensity for most of the river sites included in the study. The largest increases in flooding are in mixed-rain-and-snow basins whose current mid-winter temperatures are within a few degrees of freezing."

understood, role in hydroclimatic and biogeochemical cycles
that directly or indirectly sustain the livelihood of many people

In the past water resources have been sufficient regardless of climate. However, the continued rapid development in the Puget Sound region has increased demand. At the same time, the summer water supply has decreased. The consequence has been water shortages in the North Cascades area in 1985, 1987, 1992 and 1994 (Kresch, 1994).

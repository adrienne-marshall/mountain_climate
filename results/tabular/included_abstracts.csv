"long-duration drought variability and impacts on ecosystem services: a case study from glacier national park, montana","Instrumental climate records suggest that summer precipitation and winter snowpack in Glacier National Park ( Glacier NP), Montana, vary significantly over decadal to multidecadal time scales. Because instrumental records for the region are limited to the twentieth century, knowledge of the range of variability associated with these moisture anomalies and their impacts on ecosystems and physical processes are limited. The authors developed a reconstruction of summer ( June - August) moisture variability spanning A. D. 1540 - 2000 from a multispecies network of tree-ring chronologies in Glacier NP. Decadal-scale drought and pluvial regimes were defined as any event lasting 10 yr or greater, and the significance of each potential regime was assessed using intervention analysis. Intervention analysis prevents single intervening years of average or opposing moisture conditions from ending what was otherwise a sustained moisture regime. The reconstruction shows numerous decadal-scale shifts between persistent drought and wet events prior to the instrumental period ( before A. D. 1900). Notable wet events include a series of three long-duration, high-magnitude pluvial regimes spanning the end of the Little Ice Age ( A. D. 1770 - 1840). Though the late-nineteenth century was marked by a series of > 10 yr droughts, the single most severe dry event occurred in the early-twentieth century ( A. D. 1917 - 41). These decadal-scale dry and wet events, in conjunction with periods of high and low snowpack, have served as a driver of ecosystem processes such as forest fires and glacial dynamics in the Glacier NP region. Using a suite of paleoproxy reconstructions and information from previous studies examining the relationship between climate variability and natural processes, the authors explore how such persistent moisture anomalies affect the delivery of vital goods and services provided by Glacier NP and surrounding areas. These analyses show that regional water resources and tourism are particularly vulnerable to persistent moisture anomalies in the Glacier NP area. Many of these same decadal-scale wet and dry events were also seen among a wider network of hydroclimatic reconstructions along a north - south transect of the Rocky Mountains. Such natural climate variability can, in turn, have enormous impacts on the sustainable provision of natural resources over wide areas. Overall, these results highlight the susceptibility of goods and services provided by protected areas like Glacier NP to natural climate variability, and show that this susceptibility will likely be compounded by the effects of future human-induced climate change."
spatial variation of snowmelt and sublimation in a high-elevation semi-desert basin of western canada,"The Okanagan Basin, a semi-desert region of western Canada, is currently experiencing rapidly increasing pressure on its water resources from development and population increases, exacerbated by changes in mate. The major source of freshwater in the region originates from the melt of high-elevation snowpacks, about which little is currently known, including the proportion of the peak snowpack lost to sublimation. To better understand the hydrologic regime of this snow resource, a detailed field program was conducted during the 2007 snowmelt season. Specifically, peak annual snow distribution, ablation-season Surface-energy exchange and mass balance were measured in a forested high-elevation catchment of the Okanagan Basin. During the snowmelt period, 1-4% of the peak annual snow-water equivalent (SWE) was lost to sublimation in open sites-averaging 0.4 min d(-1). Melt and sublimation rates increased significantly with elevation, and were observed to be higher and more variable in the open sites than under forest canopies. The largest sublimation events (>0.25 mm d(-1)) were associated with low atmospheric vapour pressure, temperatures below 0 degrees C, and higher than average wind speeds. Condensation occurred under highly stable conditions in the boundary layer when sensible heat fluxes exceeded net radiative inputs to the snow surface. Melt rates were driven almost entirely by sensible heat fluxes and exceeded 30 mm d(-1) during large-scale advection events. The results from this Study will allow water managers to better predict the amount of water available for ecological, agricultural and municipal needs. This work also provides the basis for assessing changes in snow surface energetics due to ongoing salvage cutting in forested areas affected by the current mountain pine-beetle outbreak.

"connecting phenological predictions with population growth rates for mountain pine beetle, an outbreak insect","It is expected that a significant impact of global warming will be disruption of phenology as environmental cues become disassociated from their selective impacts. However there are few, if any, models directly connecting phenology with population growth rates. In this paper we discuss connecting a distributional model describing mountain pine beetle phenology with a model of population success measured using annual growth rates derived from aerially detected counts of infested trees. This model bridges the gap between phenology predictions and population viability/growth rates for mountain pine beetle. The model is parameterized and compared with 8 years of data from a recent outbreak in central Idaho, and is driven using measured tree phloem temperatures from north and south bole aspects and cumulative forest area impacted. A model driven by observed south-side phloem temperatures and that includes a correction for forest area previously infested and killed is most predictive and generates realistic parameter values of mountain pine beetle fecundity and population growth. Given that observed phloem temperatures are not always available, we explore a variety of methods for using daily maximum and minimum ambient temperatures in model predictions."
"estimating land cover-induced increases in daytime summer temperatures near mt adams, washington","A wealth of 20(th)-century instrumental data indicates that daytime near-surface temperatures differ greatly between clear-cut and mature forest stands, decreasing approximately linearly with stand height and density. Although these temperatures are easily observed in individual stands, extrapolating the net temperature effect to an actively logged terrain is difficult due to the heterogeneous mixture of different forest stand heights and densities. Previous work has related the percentage of tree shade observed in remotely sensed imagery to forest stand structure; we further developed this proxy to derive an estimate of the near-surface daytime air temperature during the summer months. This temperature proxy can be integrated across a region using both actual shade from the modern landscape and an idealized data set representing old-growth forest. In our 10 x 20 km study area on Mt. Adams, Washington, the temperature difference between these two data sets implies that as much as 0.6 degrees C of recent near-surface air temperature rise may be attributed to land cover change. Our results demonstrate that differences in regional temperatures caused by industrial-scale logging are large enough to play a significant role in other physical system responses, such as the retreat of alpine glaciers near logged forests. Because industrial-scale logging is globally pervasive and operates in the same timescale and direction as global warming trends, forcings due to land cover change may have been heretofore overlooked as a cause of the retreat of some glacier systems."
influence of bioclimatic variables on tree-line conifer distribution in the greater yellowstone ecosystem: implications for species of conservation concern,"Aim Tree-line conifers are believed to be limited by temperature worldwide, and thus may serve as important indicators of climate change. The purpose of this study was to examine the potential shifts in spatial distribution of three tree-line conifer species in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem under three future climate-change scenarios and to assess their potential sensitivity to changes in both temperature and precipitation. Location This study was performed using data from 275 sites within the boundaries of Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks, primarily located in Wyoming, USA. Methods We used data on tree-line conifer presence from the US Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis Program. Climatic and edaphic variables were derived from spatially interpolated maps and approximated for each of the sites. We used the random-forest prediction method to build a model of predicted current and future distributions of each of the species under various climate-change scenarios. Results We had good success in predicting the distribution of tree-line conifer species currently and under future climate scenarios. Temperature and temperature-related variables appeared to be most influential in the distribution of whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis), whereas precipitation and soil variables dominated the models for subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) and Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii). The model for whitebark pine substantially overpredicted absences (as compared with the other models), which is probably a result of the importance of biological factors in the distribution of this species. Main conclusions These models demonstrate the complex response of conifer distributions to changing climate scenarios. Whitebark pine is considered a 'keystone' species in the subalpine forests of western North America; however, it is believed to be nearly extinct throughout a substantial portion of its range owing to the combined effects of an introduced pathogen, outbreaks of the native mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae), and changing fire regimes. Given predicted changes in climate, it is reasonable to predict an overall decrease in pine-dominated subalpine forests in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. In order to manage these forests effectively with respect to future climate, it may be important to focus attention on monitoring dry mid- and high-elevation forests as harbingers of long-term change."
"assessing community vulnerability: a study of the mountain pine beetle outbreak in british columbia, canada","Arguing that community-based assessments of vulnerability to climate change are congruent with the scale at which policy action takes place, this paper presents an assessment of vulnerability conducted in forest-based communities surrounded by a catastrophic outbreak of forest disease. Our assessment includes measures of several dimensions of vulnerability, developed using an interdisciplinary and participatory research process. We find that for some communities vulnerability represents a high level of economic risk, while for others risk is exacerbated by institutional limitations. We also find that community perceptions of risk and bio-physical assessments differ widely for communities anticipating future outbreaks of disease. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
"conifer cover increase in the greater yellowstone ecosystem: frequency, rates, and spatial variation","Extensive fires in recent decades in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE) garnered much attention for causing a significant decrease in the extent of conifer forest cover. Meanwhile, conifer forests in unburned parts of the GYE have continued to increase in extent and density. Conifer cover increase has been well documented by repeat historical photography, but the average rate of increase and the spatial variation remain unquantified. We examined changes in conifer cover across biophysical gradients in the GYE based on stratified random samples from aerial photographs. The percent conifer cover for samples in 1971 and 1999 was quantified to determine the frequency and rate of conifer cover change. A slight majority of samples (56%) showed no change, whereas increases (22%) were balanced by decreases (22%). However, among samples that were not recently burned or logged, or already closed-canopy, nearly 40% increased in conifer cover, at an average annual rate of 0.22%. We quantified significant variability in the frequency and rate of conifer cover increase across gradients of elevation, aspect, vegetation type, and proximity to nearby conifer forest. The most dynamic locations were low density conifer woodlands on northerly aspects at lower elevations, with average annual rates of increase up to 0.51%. This study is significant because it demonstrates that rates of conifer cover increase vary across biophysical gradients, an important consideration for management of dynamic forest ecosystems. Improved understanding of this variability helps us to better understand what factors ultimately cause conifer cover increase. It is also a critical step towards accurate quantification of the magnitude of carbon uptake by conifer cover increase."
inbreeding and conservation genetics in whitebark pine,"Whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis Engelm.) is threatened across its native range by an exotic fungal pathogen introduced within the last century. Mortality has been extensive, and projected potential range shifts based on impending climate change have revealed further pressures to survival and adaptation for this long-lived, high-elevation conifer. Quantifying genetic variation and the mating system of whitebark pine in its northern range provides a basis for effective conservation measures. Isozyme analysis of vegetative bud tissue revealed high expected heterozygosity (0.262), moderate population differentiation (F-ST = 0.061) and highly significant correlations between observed heterozygosity and geographic variables (R-2 = 0.36, latitude; R-2 = 0.30 longitude), supporting the hypothesis that this species recolonized its current northern range following glacial retreat from several refugia in the Washington and Oregon Cascades and in the northern Rockies. Mating system analysis based on simultaneous isozyme analyses of embryo and haploid megagametophyte tissues found relatively high levels of consanguineous mating and selfing for a conifer (t(m) = 0.73) within populations. Avian seed distribution by the Clark's nutcracker (Nucifragia columbiana Wilson) appears to be the overriding factor influencing genetic patterns: being a mutualistic seed disperser, caches comprised of related seeds develop into clumped stands with strong family substructure. While it is a critical wildlife habitat component, lack of commercial utilization has made in situ adaptation the primary conservation focus. Encouraging regeneration success and nutcracker caching by maintaining natural fire regimes will provide an ecosystem-based conservation solution; however, in the Rocky Mountains between 52degreesN and 47degreesN, disease-resistant individuals should be located and propagated in order to ensure long-term survival of the species in high pathogen hazard areas."
linking observed and general circulation model upper air circulation patterns to current and future snow runoff for the rocky mountains,"Snowmelt runoff from alpine areas is the primary source of streamflow and water supply in western North America. Increasingly, questions about the impacts of global climate change on watershed yield are being asked. This paper is a forecast of expected changes to runoff for two key rivers in western North America. The paper develops and applies linkages between historical and general circulation model (GCM) upper air circulation patterns deemed to control winter precipitation in the northern Rocky Mountain states and southern Alberta. Historical and 1 x CO2 GCM upper airflow conditions are quite similar, but there are substantive variations in the GCM 2 x CO2 upper airflows. Relative occurrence (dominance) of historical synoptic patterns is statistically linked to historical spring runoff for the Oldman and Colorado Rivers. These linkages are used to forecast variation in the future runoff on the basis of variations in synoptic pattern statistics for the 2 x CO2 GCM upper airflow patterns."
pacific northwest climate sensitivity simulated by a regional climate model driven by a gcm part ii: 2xco(2) simulations,"Global climate change due to increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases has stimulated numerous studies and discussions about its possible impacts on water resources. Climate scenarios generated by climate models at spatial resolutions ranging from about 50 km to 400 km may not provide enough spatial specificity for use in impact assessment. In Parts I and II of this paper. the spatial specificity issue is addressed by examining what information on mesoscale and small-scale spatial features can be gained by using a regional climate model with a subgrid parameterization of orographic precipitation and land surface cover, driven by a general circulation model. Numerical experiments have been performed to simulate the present-day climatology and the climate conditions corresponding to a doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentration. This paper describes and contrasts the large-scale and mesoscale features of the greenhouse warming climate signals simulated by the general circulation modal and regional climate model over the Pacific Northwest. Results indicate that changes in the large-scale circulation exhibit strong seasonal variability. There is an average warming of about 2 degrees C, and precipitation generally increases over the Pacific Northwest and decreases over California. The precipitation signal over the Pacific Northwest is only statistically significant during spring, when both the change in the large-scale circulation and increase in water vapor enhance the moisture convergence toward the north Pacific coast. The combined effects of surface temperature and precipitation changes are such that snow cover is reduced by up to 50% on average, causing large changes in the seasonal runoff. This paper also describes the high spatial resolution (1.5 km) climate signals simulated by the regional climate model. Reductions in snow cover of 50%-90% are found in areas near the snow line of the control simulation. Analyses of the variations of the climate signals with surface elevation ranging from sea level to 4000 m over two mountain ranges in the Pacific Northwest show that because of changes in the alitude of the freezing level, strong elevation dependency is found in the surface temperature, rainfall. snowfall, snow cover, and runoff signals."
phenology-mediated effects of climatic change on some simulated british columbia forests,"We added certain aspects of species-specific phenology, and of local frost regimes to a standard invididual-based patch model of forest stand dynamics, which we used to explore the possible consequences of four climate-change scenarios in eight distinct forest regions in British Columbia, Canada. According to model projections, lowland temperate coastal forests will be severely stressed because forest tree species will no longer have their winter-chilling requirements met. High-elevation coastal forests may either remain stable or decrease in productivity, while interior subalpine forests may eventually resemble those now found in the coastal mountains. Southern interior forests are likely to persist relatively unchanged, while boreal and sub-boreal forests of the northern interior may become dominated by Douglas-fir and western larch, rather than by spruce and pine as at present. The rate of change in forest composition may be very high in some cases. Changes under the four climate-change scenarios generally vary in magnitude but not in direction. This exercise illustrates that different forest types might respond to a changing climate for different reasons, and at different rates."
"future water supply and demand in the okanagan basin, british columbia: a scenario-based analysis of multiple, interacting stressors","Surface water is critical for meeting water needs in British Columbia's Okanagan Basin, but the timing and magnitude of its availability is being altered through climate and land use changes and growing water demand. Greater attention needs to be given to the multiple, interacting factors occurring and projected to occur in this region if water is going to be sustainably provisioned to human users and available for ecosystem needs. This study contributes to that goal by integrating information on physical, biological and social processes in order to project a range of possible changes to surface water availability resulting from land-use, climatic and demographic change, as well as from Mountain Pine Beetle infestation. An integrated water management model (Water Evaluation and Planning system, WEAP) was used to consider future scenarios for water supply and demand in both unregulated and reservoir-supported streams that supply the District of Peachland. Results demonstrate that anticipated future climate conditions will critically reduce streamflow relative to projected uses (societal demand and ecological flow requirements). The surficial storage systems currently in place were found unable to meet municipal and instream flow needs during ""normal"" precipitation years by the 2050s. Improvements may be found through demand reduction, especially in the near term. Beyond the implications for the District of Peachland, this work demonstrates a method of using an accessible modeling tool for integrating knowledge from the fields of climate science, forest hydrology, water systems management and stream ecology to aid in water and land management decision-making."
projected changes in snowfall extremes and interannual variability of snowfall in the western united states,"Projected warming will have significant impacts on snowfall accumulation and melt, with implications for water availability and management in snow-dominated regions. Changes in snowfall extremes are confounded by projected increases in precipitation extremes. Downscaled climate projections from 20 global climate models were bias-corrected to montane Snowpack Telemetry stations across the western United States to assess mid-21st century changes in the mean and variability of annual snowfall water equivalent (SFE) and extreme snowfall events, defined by the 90th percentile of cumulative 3 day SFE amounts. Declines in annual SFE and number of snowfall days were projected for all stations. Changes in the magnitude of snowfall event quantiles were sensitive to historical winter temperature. At climatologically cooler locations, such as in the Rocky Mountains, changes in the magnitude of snowfall events mirrored changes in the distribution of precipitation events, with increases in extremes and less change in more moderate events. By contrast, declines in snowfall event magnitudes were found for all quantiles in warmer locations. Common to both warmer and colder sites was a relative increase in the magnitude of snowfall extremes compared to annual SFE and a larger fraction of annual SFE from snowfall extremes. The coefficient of variation of annual SFE increased up to 80% in warmer montane regions due to projected declines in snowfall days and the increased contribution of snowfall extremes to annual SFE. In addition to declines in mean annual SFE, more frequent low-snowfall years and less frequent high-snowfall years were projected for every station."
"epiphytic lichen indication of nitrogen deposition and climate in the northern rocky mountains, usa","Lichen bioindication can provide economical and spatially extensive monitoring of climate and pollution impacts on ecological communities. We used non-metric multidimensional scaling of lichen community composition and generalized additive models to analyze regional climate and pollution gradients in the northern Rocky Mountains, U.S. Temperature extremes, relative humidity, and N-deposition were strongly related to lichen community composition. Eutrophic species (genera Physcia, Xanthomendoza, and Xanthoria) were associated with high N deposition, low precipitation, and temperature extremes. Estimated N deposition in our study ranged from <0.5 to 4.26 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) with degradation to lichen communities observed at 4.0 kg N ha(-1) year(-1), the indicated critical load. The resulting model can track changes in climate and N pollution related to lichen communities over time, identify probable sensitive or impacted habitats, and provide key information for natural resource management and conservation. The approach is broadly applicable to temperate ecosystems worldwide. Published by Elsevier Ltd."
recent tree mortality and recruitment in mature and old-growth forests in western washington,"Tree mortality is a fundamental driver of forest ecosystems and occurs both in catastrophic events and as a chronic process. Persistent changes in the rate of chronic or background mortality can dramatically alter the structure and composition of forests stands. Tree recruitment is the complement to tree mortality, combining with mortality to determine changes in tree density and species composition. The purpose of this study is to ascertain trends of mortality and recruitment in mature and old-growth forests in western Washington state, U.S.A. We used a set of permanent plots established in units of the National Park System spanning the environmental gradient of forests in these parks (from near sea-level to 1800 m elevation). Duration of observation was five years for most plots and two or three years for a small number of plots. Principal tree species on the plots were Picea sitchensis, Tsuga heterophylla, Pseudotsuga menziesii, Thuja plicata, Abies lasiocarpa, and Abies amabilis. Tree mortality was evaluated annually; recruitment was recorded at the end of the study. For small (dbh 12.7-76.1 cm) and large (dbh >76.1 cm) trees, annual mortality pooled across all elevations, parks, plots, and years was <1% (mean and upper 95% confidence intervals). For saplings (dbh 2.5-12.6 cm), mean mortality was <1% though the upper limit of the confidence interval was slightly greater than 1%. Recruitment outweighed mortality (and growth into the small-tree class) for saplings. Recruitment and losses of stems balanced one another for small trees; both processes were negligible for large trees. Recruitment of saplings increased representation of shade-tolerant species (e.g., T. heterophylla, and A. amabilis). Biotic factors predominated as the proximate cause of death for all size-classes of trees (i.e., trees died standing), though particular agents of mortality were not identified in most cases. Our results contrasted with a recent report of annual tree mortality >1% for unmanipulated, old-growth forests in the Pacific Northwest. Published by Elsevier B.V."
projections of contemporary and future climate niche for wyoming big sagebrush (artemisia tridentata subsp wyomingensis): a guide for restoration,"Big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) is one of the most widespread and abundant plant species in the intermountain regions of western North America. This species occupies an extremely wide ecological niche ranging from the semi-arid basins to the subalpine. Within this large niche, three widespread subspecies are recognized. Montane ecoregions are occupied by subspecies vaseyana, while subspecies wyomingensis and tridentata occupy basin ecoregions. In cases of wide-ranging species with multiple subspecies, it can be more practical from the scientific and management perspective to assess the climate profiles at the subspecies level. We focus bioclimatic model efforts on subspecies wyomingensis, which is the most widespread and abundant of the subspecies and critical habitat to wildlife including sage-grouse and pygmy rabbits. Using absence points from species with allopatric ranges to Wyoming big sagebrush (i.e.. targeted groups absences) and randomly sampled points from specific ecoregions, we modeled the climatic envelope for subspecies wyomingensis using Random Forests multiple-regression tree for contemporary and future climates (decade 2050). Overall model error was low, at 4.5%, with the vast majority accounted for by errors in commission (>99.9%). Comparison of the contemporary and decade 2050 models shows a predicted 39% loss of suitable climate. Much of this loss will occur in the Great Basin where impacts from increasing tire frequency and encroaching weeds have been eroding the A. tridentata landscape dominance and ecological functions. Our goal of the A. tridentata subsp. wyomingensis bioclimatic model is to provide a management tool to promote successful restoration by predicting the geographic areas where climate is suitable for this subspecies. This model can also be used as a restoration-planning tool to assess vulnerability of climatic extirpation over the next few decades."
patterns of regional hydroclimatic shifts: an analysis of changing hydrologic regimes,"Temporal shifts in precipitation and runoff regime curves appear throughout the continental United States, but differ from region to region. This paper explores these regime shifts by building upon a hydroclimatic classification system that partitions the United States into clusters of similarly behaved catchments using four simple hydroclimatic indicators. Hydroclimate data from over four hundred catchments over a 55 year period (belonging to the MOPEX data set) are analyzed to reveal how the indicators have shifted before and after 1970, before and after 1975, and before and after 1980. Statistically significant hydroclimatic changes in these indicators are explored qualitatively, suggesting which catchments today might resemble other catchments tomorrow. Thus, a preview of current locations in one class under future conditions is provided by observing existing locations of another class. The classification system structure enables organization of these data, allowing patterns of regime change to emerge without highly specified models at each individual site. Regional analyses explore changes in mean seasonal precipitation/runoff regimes, including shifts in the daily variability of precipitation and runoff. Additionally, changes in regime curves of minimum and maximum precipitation/runoff observations are analyzed and discussed. Results indicate that after 1980, classifications typically found in the southeastern quarter of the United States have expanded northward and westward. Regionally, the Midwest and Rocky Mountains seem to demonstrate more frequent, but less intense storms after 1980, while southeastern catchments receive much less water in the form of precipitation and runoff than in previous years. Key Points <list list-type=""bulleted""> <list-item id=""wrcr20773-li-0001"">The effects of hydroclimatic change are present in every regional cluster <list-item id=""wrcr20773-li-0002"">These impacts manifest differently by region <list-item id=""wrcr20773-li-0003"">A preview of future conditions may already exist elsewhere"
dietary plasticity in pikas as a strategy for atypical resource landscapes,"Mammalian habitat specialists are suffering notable population declines and localized extinctions in response to climate change. Plastic behavioral responses, especially in foraging, may be critical for specialists to tolerate changes in temperature, precipitation, and resource availability. Here, we investigate the foraging behavior of a mammalian alpine specialist living in atypical habitat. American pikas (Ochotona princeps) are typically limited to high elevations in western North America; however, they persist near sea level in the Columbia River Gorge, well outside their previously assumed climatic niche. We hypothesized that utilizing unusual food resources contributes to pika persistence in this unusual climate. Moss comprised more than 60% of the diet at 2 sites, more than observed for any mammalian herbivore in the wild. Moss is available year-round in this habitat; thus, by specializing on moss, pikas do not have to construct large food caches to survive winter. These results suggest a larger degree of behavioral and dietary plasticity than preViously assumed for this species. Understanding a species' capacity to adapt its foraging strategies to new resource landscapes will be essential to assessing its vulnerability to future climate change and to developing conservation plans."
modulation of linear and nonlinear hydroclimatic dynamics by mountain glaciers in canada and norway: results from information-theoretic polynomial selection,"Historical streamflow and climate datasets were analyzed for low- and high-frequency hydroclimatic variability. Four glacial/non-glacial catchment pairs were considered, two from the southern Canadian Rocky Mountains and two from arctic coastal Norway. Analyses were performed using daily data, providing high seasonal resolution and facilitating the identification of possible nonlinear hydroclimatic processes. Spearman rank correlation, and an information theory-based polynomial selection method, were employed in parallel. The latter permits straightforward identification of highly nonlinear relationships, simultaneous consideration of multiple models and estimation of the probability of a given relationship, as distinct from conventional p-values. Highly nonlinear (parabolic) atmospheric teleconnections to the Arctic Oscillation and El Nino-Southern Oscillation were confirmed in Norway and Canada, respectively, and their corresponding hydrologic effects were detected; conversely, little evidence for deviation from linearity was found for long-term monotonic trends. Presence or absence of watershed glacial cover was found to fundamentally alter streamflow responses to climate variability and change. In particular, for ecologically highly relevant late-summer low flows, glaciers induced: (1) stronger negative long-term trends than observed for non-glacial basins, presumably reflecting net mass balance declines seen in nearby glaciers, and (2) parabolic teleconnections, largely absent in non-glacial basins, reflecting parabolic air temperature teleconnections and the presence or absence of glacial ice available for melting."
the missing mountain water: slower westerlies decrease orographic enhancement in the pacific northwest usa,"Trends in streamflow timing and volume in the Pacific Northwest United States have been attributed to increased temperatures, because trends in precipitation at lower-elevation stations were negligible. We demonstrate that observed streamflow declines are probably associated with declines in mountain precipitation, revealing previously unexplored differential trends. Lower-troposphere winter (November to March) westerlies are strongly correlated with high-elevation precipitation but weakly correlated with low-elevation precipitation. Decreases in lower-tropospheric winter westerlies across the region from 1950 to 2012 are hypothesized to have reduced orographic precipitation enhancement, yielding differential trends in precipitation across elevations and contributing to the decline in annual streamflow. Climate projections show weakened lower-troposphere zonal flow across the region under enhanced greenhouse forcing, highlighting an additional stressor that is relevant for climate change impacts on hydrology."
restoring salmon habitat for a changing climate,"An important question for salmon restoration efforts in the western USA is How should habitat restoration plans be altered to accommodate climate change effects on stream flow and temperature?' We developed a decision support process for adapting salmon recovery plans that incorporates (1) local habitat factors limiting salmon recovery, (2) scenarios of climate change effects on stream flow and temperature, (3) the ability of restoration actions to ameliorate climate change effects, and (4) the ability of restoration actions to increase habitat diversity and salmon population resilience. To facilitate the use of this decision support framework, we mapped scenarios of future stream flow and temperature in the Pacific Northwest region and reviewed literature on habitat restoration actions to determine whether they ameliorate a climate change effect or increase life history diversity and salmon resilience. Under the climate change scenarios considered here, summer low flows decrease by 35-75% west of the Cascade Mountains, maximum monthly flows increase by 10-60% across most of the region, and stream temperatures increase between 2 and 6 degrees C by 2070-2099. On the basis of our literature review, we found that restoring floodplain connectivity, restoring stream flow regimes, and re-aggrading incised channels are most likely to ameliorate stream flow and temperature changes and increase habitat diversity and population resilience. By contrast, most restoration actions focused on in-stream rehabilitation are unlikely to ameliorate climate change effects. Finally, we illustrate how the decision support process can be used to evaluate whether climate change should alter the types or priority of restoration actions in a salmon habitat restoration plan.

bed stability in unconfined gravel bed mountain streams: with implications for salmon spawning viability in future climates,"Incubating eggs of autumn-spawning Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) could be at risk of midwinter high flows and substrate scour in a changing climate. A high-spatial-resolution multidimensional hydrodynamics model was used to assess the degree of scour risk in low-gradient unconfined gravel bed channels that are the favored environment for autumn-spawning salmon in mountain watersheds such as the Middle Fork Salmon River (MFSR), Idaho. In one of the most important MFSR spawning tributaries, near-bed shear stresses were relatively low at all discharges from base flows to 300% of bankfull. The highest stresses were found only in small areas of the central flow core and not at spawning sites. Median shear stresses did not increase in overbank flow conditions because poor channel confinement released the excess water into adjacent floodplains. Channel and floodplain topography, rather than discharge, control the maximum near-bed shear stresses. Over the modeled range of discharges, similar to 2% of the total surface area of the main stem channel bed was predicted to be mobile. Even in known spawning areas, where shear stresses are higher, 20% of the spawning surface area was mobile during overbank flows with a 2year recurrence interval. Field measurements of little gravel transport during flows that were 93% of bankfull support the numerical model predictions. Regardless of some uncertainty in future climates in these watersheds, there appears to be relatively limited risk of extensive scour at salmon spawning sites in any likely hydrologic regimes."
spatial heterogeneity in ecologically important climate variables at coarse and fine scales in a high-snow mountain landscape,"Climate plays an important role in determining the geographic ranges of species. With rapid climate change expected in the coming decades, ecologists have predicted that species ranges will shift large distances in elevation and latitude. However, most range shift assessments are based on coarse-scale climate models that ignore fine-scale heterogeneity and could fail to capture important range shift dynamics. Moreover, if climate varies dramatically over short distances, some populations of certain species may only need to migrate tens of meters between microhabitats to track their climate as opposed to hundreds of meters upward or hundreds of kilometers poleward. To address these issues, we measured climate variables that are likely important determinants of plant species distributions and abundances (snow disappearance date and soil temperature) at coarse and fine scales at Mount Rainier National Park in Washington State, USA. Coarse-scale differences across the landscape such as large changes in elevation had expected effects on climatic variables, with later snow disappearance dates and lower temperatures at higher elevations. However, locations separated by small distances (similar to 20 m), but differing by vegetation structure or topographic position, often experienced differences in snow disappearance date and soil temperature as great as locations separated by large distances (>1 km). Tree canopy gaps and topographic depressions experienced later snow disappearance dates than corresponding locations under intact canopy and on ridges. Additionally, locations under vegetation and on topographic ridges experienced lower maximum and higher minimum soil temperatures. The large differences in climate we observed over small distances will likely lead to complex range shift dynamics and could buffer species from the negative effects of climate change."
"dynamically downscaled winter precipitation over complex terrain of the central rockies of western montana, usa","We evaluate the results of dynamically downscaled winter precipitation over Western Montana using the weather research and forecasting (WRF) model through comparison with estimates from the observationally based parameter-elevation regressions on independent slopes model (PRISM). Seven years (six winters) from 2000 to 2006 are simulated at 4 km resolution to assess the similarities and differences between the two models as well as the implications for hydrologic modeling. Inherent biases in both approaches are apparent, highlighting the difficulty in climate model validation. Results show general agreement between the two models in the spatial distribution of winter precipitation. A principal component analysis shows similar spatial patterns between models in the leading six components suggesting that the main processes that drive the spatial distribution of precipitation were properly captured. The first component explains almost 70% of total variance, and the first three components explain more than 85% in both data sets. The largest differences between the two data sets exist in areas at high elevation and upstream of the continental divide where observations are sparse. In these areas, WRF consistently predicts higher amounts of precipitation and larger interannual variability than PRISM. We suggest that these results are realistic for impingement of moist air masses on topography and, if correct, could have significant implications in flood forecasting, water resource management, and climate change studies.

using expert judgments to explore robust alternatives for forest management under climate change,"We develop and apply a judgment-based approach to selecting robust alternatives, which are defined here as reasonably likely to achieve objectives, over a range of uncertainties. The intent is to develop an approach that is more practical in terms of data and analysis requirements than current approaches, informed by the literature and experience with probability elicitation and judgmental forecasting. The context involves decisions about managing forest lands that have been severely affected by mountain pine beetles in British Columbia, a pest infestation that is climate-exacerbated. A forest management decision was developed as the basis for the context, objectives, and alternatives for land management actions, to frame and condition the judgments. A wide range of climate forecasts, taken to represent the 1090% levels on cumulative distributions for future climate, were developed to condition judgments. An elicitation instrument was developed, tested, and revised to serve as the basis for eliciting probabilistic three-point distributions regarding the performance of selected alternatives, over a set of relevant objectives, in the short and long term. The elicitations were conducted in a workshop comprising 14 regional forest management specialists. We employed the concept of stochastic dominance to help identify robust alternatives. We used extensive sensitivity analysis to explore the patterns in the judgments, and also considered the preferred alternatives for each individual expert. The results show that two alternatives that are more flexible than the current policies are judged more likely to perform better than the current alternatives on average in terms of stochastic dominance. The results suggest judgmental approaches to robust decision making deserve greater attention and testing."
impacts of climate change on august stream discharge in the central-rocky mountains,"In the snowmelt dominated hydrology of arid western US landscapes, late summer low streamflow is the most vulnerable period for aquatic ecosystem habitats and trout populations. This study analyzes mean August discharge at 153 streams throughout the Central Rocky Mountains of North America (CRMs) for changes in discharge from 1950-2008. The purpose of this study was to determine if: (1) Mean August stream discharge values have decreased over the last half-century; (2) Low discharge values are occurring more frequently; (3) Climatic variables are influencing August discharge trends. Here we use a strict selection process to characterize gauging stations based on amount of anthropogenic impact in order to identify heavily impacted rivers and understand the relationship between climatic variables and discharge trends. Using historic United States Geologic Survey discharge data, we analyzed data for trends of 40-59 years. Combining of these records along with aerial photos and water rights records we selected gauging stations based on the length and continuity of discharge records and categorized each based on the amount of diversion. Variables that could potentially influence discharge such as change in vegetation and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) were examined, but we found that that both did not significantly influence August discharge patterns. Our analyses indicate that non-regulated watersheds are experiencing substantial declines in stream discharge and we have found that 89% of all non-regulated stations exhibit a declining slope. Additionally our results here indicate a significant (alpha a parts per thousand currency signaEuro parts per thousand 0.10) decline in discharge from 1951-2008 for the CRMs. Correlations results at our pristine sites show a negative relationship between air temperatures and discharge and these results coupled with increasing air temperature trends pose serious concern for aquatic ecosystems in CRMs."
modeling the occurrence of 15 coniferous tree species throughout the pacific northwest of north america using a hybrid approach of a generic process-based growth model and decision tree analysis,"Question: Can we interpret how climatic variation limits photosynthesis and growth for one widely distributed species, and then relate these responses to model the geographic distributions of other species? Location: The forested region of the Pacific Northwest, United States and Canada. Methods: We first mapped monthly climatic data, averaged for the period 1950 to 1975 at 1 km resolution across the region. The recorded presence and absence of 15 native tree species were next mapped at 1 km resolution from data acquired on 22 771 field survey plots. To establish seasonal limits on photosynthesis and water use, a process-based growth model (3-PG, Physiological Processes to Predict Growth) was parameterized for Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), one of the most widely distributed species in the region. Automated decision tree analyses were used to predict the distribution of different species by creating a suite of rules associated with the relative constraints that soil drought, atmospheric humidity deficits, suboptimal and subfreezing temperatures would impose on the growth of Douglas-fir. Results: The 3-PG process-based modeling approach, combined with automated decision tree analyses, predicted presence and absence of 15 conifers on field survey plots with an average accuracy of 82 +/- 12%. Predictive models of current distribution for each species differed in the number of, order in, and physiological thresholds selected. A deficit in the soil water balance, followed by departures from optimum temperatures in the summer were the two most important variables selected in predicting species distributions. Conclusions: Although empirical models using different sampling techniques and statistical analyses may be more accurate in predicting current distribution of species, the hybrid approach presented in this paper provides a greater mechanistic understanding of the limits to growth and tree distributions. These attributes of process-based models make them particularly useful in designing mitigating strategies to projected changes in climate."
adequacies and deficiencies of alpine and subalpine treeline studies in the national parks of the western usa,"To mitigate the impact of direct human activity on treeline pattern and process, much alpine treeline research in the western USA has been conducted in nationally protected areas. The use of treeline as a proxy for climate change has been assessed in parks throughout the west but often at the expense of geology or geomorphology as controls of treeline variation. The dissimilar geology and geomorphic processes of the western national parks suggest that treeline may respond differently between national parks when subjected to disturbance. Therefore, predicted vegetation response to disturbance across the western USA may provide a limited assessment of change beyond fine-scale analysis due to data collection from a limited number of national parks containing alpine treeline. We performed a content analysis on previous research that examined alpine treeline in national parks and classified each treeline study as anthropogenic, orographic/edaphic, or climatic according to the primary factor attributed to treeline control. Results indicated that the three types of treeline are not uniformly studied. Climatic treeline is most commonly studied whereas anthropogenic and orographic/edaphic studies are often lacking. Furthermore, several western national parks are entirely devoid of anthropogenic and orographic treeline research. Similar findings exist for treeline studies in protected places worldwide. More research in protected places is required to broaden our understanding of multiple treeline processes across both regional and worldwide extents."
"biology, status, and management of the yellowstone cutthroat trout","Yellowstone cutthroat trout Oncorhynchus clarkii bouvieri were historically distributed in the Yellowstone River drainage (Montana and Wyoming) and the Snake River drainage (Wyoming, Idaho, Utah, Nevada, and probably Washington). Individual populations evolved distinct life history characteristics in response to the diverse environments in which they were isolated after the last glaciation. Anthropogenic activities have resulted in a substantial decline (42% of the historical range is currently occupied; 28% is occupied by core [genetically unaltered] populations), but the number of extant populations, especially in headwater streams, has precluded listing of this taxon under the Endangered Species Act. Primary threats to persistence of Yellowstone cutthroat trout include (1) invasive species, resulting in hybridization, predation, disease, and interspecific competition; (2) habitat degradation from human activities such as agricultural practices, water diversions, grazing, dam construction, mineral extraction, grazing, timber harvest, and road construction; and (3) climate change, including an escalating risk of drought, wildfire, winter flooding, and rising temperatures. Extirpation of individual populations or assemblages has led to increasing isolation and fragmentation of remaining groups, which in turn raises susceptibility to the demographic influences of disturbance (both human and stochastic) and genetic factors. Primary conservation strategies include (1) preventing risks associated with invasive species by isolating populations of Yellowstone cutthroat trout and (2) connecting occupied habitats (where possible) to preserve metapopulation function and the expression of multiple life histories. Because persistence of isolated populations may be greater in the short term, current management is focused on isolating individual populations and restoring habitats; however, this approach implies that humans will act as dispersal agents if a population is extirpated because of stochastic events."
"influences of climate, fire, grazing, and logging on woody species composition along an elevation gradient in the eastern cascades, washington","Across western North America, current ecosystem structure has been determined by historical interactions between climate, fire, livestock grazing, and logging. Climate change could substantially alter species abundance and composition, but the relative weight of the legacy of historical factors and projected future conditions in informing management objectives remains unresolved. We integrated land use histories with broad scale climatic factors to better understand how inland Pacific Northwest ecosystems may develop under projected climates. We measured vegetation structure and age distributions in five vegetation types (shrub steppe to subalpine forest) along an elevation gradient in the eastern Cascades of Washington. We quantitatively assessed compositional changes, and qualitatively summarized the environmental history (climate, fire and fire suppression, grazing, and logging) of each site. Little change was evident in woody species composition at the shrub steppe site. At the shrub steppe/forest ecotone, densities of drought-tolerant Artemisia tripartita and Pinus ponderosa increased. In the dry conifer, montane, and subalpine forest sites, increases in Pseudotsuga menziesii, Abies grandis, and Abies lasiocarpa, respectively, and decreases in Pinus ponderosa, Larix occidentalis, and Pinus contorta, respectively, have shifted species composition from fire and drought-tolerant species to shade-tolerant species. Fire suppression, grazing, and logging explain changes in species composition more clearly than climate variation does, although the relative influence of these factors varies with elevation. Furthermore, some of the observed changes in composition are opposite what we expect would be most suited to projected future climates. Natural resource managers need to recognize that the current state of an ecosystem reflects historical land uses, and that contemporary management actions can have long-term effects on ecosystem structure. Understanding the processes that generated an ecosystem's current structure will lead to more informed management decisions to effectively respond to projected climate changes. (C) 2010 Elsevier By.

implications of 21st century climate change for the hydrology of washington state,"Pacific Northwest (PNW) hydrology is particularly sensitive to changes in climate because snowmelt dominates seasonal runoff, and temperature changes impact the rain/snow balance. Based on results from the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC AR4), we updated previous studies of implications of climate change on PNW hydrology. PNW 21st century hydrology was simulated using 20 Global Climate Models (GCMs) and 2 greenhouse gas emissions scenarios over Washington and the greater Columbia River watershed, with additional focus on the Yakima River watershed and the Puget Sound which are particularly sensitive to climate change. We evaluated projected changes in snow water equivalent (SWE), soil moisture, runoff, and streamflow for A1B and B1 emissions scenarios for the 2020s, 2040s, and 2080s. April 1 SWE is projected to decrease by approximately 38-46% by the 2040s (compared with the mean over water years 1917-2006), based on composite scenarios of B1 and A1B, respectively, which represent average effects of all climate models. In three relatively warm transient watersheds west of the Cascade crest, April 1 SWE is projected to almost completely disappear by the 2080s. By the 2080s, seasonal streamflow timing will shift significantly in both snowmelt dominant and rain-snow mixed watersheds. Annual runoff across the State is projected to increase by 2-3% by the 2040s; these changes are mainly driven by projected increases in winter precipitation."
impacts of climate change from 2000 to 2050 on wildfire activity and carbonaceous aerosol concentrations in the western united states,"We investigate the impact of climate change on wildfire activity and carbonaceous aerosol concentrations in the western United States. We regress observed area burned onto observed meteorological fields and fire indices from the Canadian Fire Weather Index system and find that May-October mean temperature and fuel moisture explain 24-57% of the variance in annual area burned in this region. Applying meteorological fields calculated by a general circulation model (GCM) to our regression model, we show that increases in temperature cause annual mean area burned in the western United States to increase by 54% by the 2050s relative to the present day. Changes in area burned are ecosystem dependent, with the forests of the Pacific Northwest and Rocky Mountains experiencing the greatest increases of 78 and 175%, respectively. Increased area burned results in near doubling of wildfire carbonaceous aerosol emissions by midcentury. Using a chemical transport model driven by meteorology from the same GCM, we calculate that climate change will increase summertime organic carbon (OC) aerosol concentrations over the western United States by 40% and elemental carbon (EC) concentrations by 20% from 2000 to 2050. Most of this increase (75% for OC and 95% for EC) is caused by larger wildfire emissions with the rest caused by changes in meteorology and for OC by increased monoterpene emissions in a warmer climate. Such an increase in carbonaceous aerosol would have important consequences for western U. S. air quality and visibility."
lakes and forests as determinants of downstream nutrient concentrations in small mountain watersheds,"Lakes are dynamic processors of nutrients and may hold an active role in modifying the water chemistry of stream systems. In this study, we examine the influence of lakes and an important terrestrial component-forest cover-on the nutrient levels of stream water in 11 Rocky Mountain (Idaho) watersheds. Water samples were collected from the inflow and outflow of lakes with varying amounts of upstream lakes and forested area during spring runoff and summer base flow. During base flow, mean total nitrogen concentrations at the inflow of final lakes were significantly related to relative upstream lake area, increasing from 34 to 103 mu g N L-1 as upstream lake cover in the watersheds increased from 0% to 4%. Forest cover was not significantly correlated with total nitrogen concentrations exported from the watersheds. However, similar to other studies, inflow nitrate concentrations were negatively correlated with relative forest cover. At the scale of individual lakes, dissolved organic carbon and dissolved organic nitrogen increased, and nitrate was significantly reduced from inflows to outflows. The results indicate a potentially critical role of mountain lakes in governing nitrogen flux downstream, and suggest the role of lakes as nitrogen sinks or sources may reverse between spring runoff and summer base flow."
alpine treeline of western north america: linking organism-to-landscape dynamics,"Although the ecological dynamics of the alpine treeline ecotone are influenced by climate, it is an imperfect indicator of climate change. Mechanistic processes that shape the ecotone-seed rain, seed germination, seedling establishment and subsequent tree growth form, or, conversely tree dieback-depend on microsite patterns. Growth forms affect wind and snow, and so develop positive and negative feedback loops that create these microsites. As a result, complex landscape patterns are generated at multiple spatial scales. Although these mechanistic processes are fundamentally the same for all forest-tundra ecotones across western North America, factors such as prior climate, underlying geology and geomorphology, and genetic constraints of dominant tree species lead to geographic differences in the responses of particular ecotones to climate change."
"twentieth-century trends in runoff, evapotranspiration, and soil moisture in the western united states","A physically based hydrology model is used to produce time series for the period 1916 - 2003 of evapo-transpiration ( ET), runoff, and soil moisture ( SM) over the western United States from which long- term trends are evaluated. The results show that trends in ET in spring and summer are determined primarily by trends in precipitation and snowmelt that determine water availability. From April to June, ET trends are mostly positive due primarily to earlier snowmelt and earlier emergence of snow-free ground, and secondarily to increasing trends in spring precipitation. From July to September trends in ET are more strongly influenced by precipitation trends, with the exception of areas ( most notably California) that receive little summer precipitation and have experienced large changes in snowmelt timing. Trends in the seasonal timing of ET are modest, but during the period 1947 - 2003 when temperature trends are large, they reflect a shift of ET from midsummer to early summer and late spring. As in other studies, it is found that runoff is occurring earlier in spring, a trend that is related primarily to increasing temperature, and is most apparent during 1947 - 2003. Trends in the annual runoff ratio, a variable critical to western water management, are determined primarily by trends in cool season precipitation, rather than changes in the timing of runoff or ET. It was found that the signature of temperature- related trends in runoff and SM is strongly keyed to mean midwinter [ December - February ( DJF)] temperatures. Areas with warmer winter temperatures show increasing trends in the runoff fraction as early as February, and colder areas as late as June. Trends toward earlier spring SM recharge are apparent and increasing trends in SM on 1 April are evident over much of the region. The 1 July SM trends are less affected by snowmelt changes and are controlled more by precipitation trends."
changing temperatures influence suitability for modeled mountain pine beetle (dendroctonus ponderosae) outbreaks in the western united states,"[1] Insect outbreaks are significant disturbances in forests of the western United States, with infestation comparable in area to fire. Outbreaks of mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) require life cycles of one year with synchronous emergence of adults from host trees at an appropriate time of year (termed ""adaptive seasonality'') to overwhelm tree defenses. The annual course of temperature plays a major role in governing life stage development and imposing synchrony on mountain pine beetle populations. Here we apply a process-based model of adaptive seasonality across the western United States using gridded daily temperatures from the Vegetation/Ecosystem Modeling and Analysis Project (VEMAP) over the period 1895-2100. Historical locations of modeled adaptive seasonality overlay much of the distribution of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Douglas), a favored host, indicating that suitable temperatures for outbreak occurred in areas of host availability. A range of suitable temperatures, both in the mean and over an annual cycle, resulted in adaptive seasonality. Adaptive seasonality typically occurred when mean annual temperatures were 3 degrees-6 degrees C, but also included locations where mean temperatures were as low as 1 degrees C or as high as 11 degrees C, primarily as a result of variability in winter temperatures. For most locations, years of adaptive seasonality were uncommon during 1895-1993. We analyzed historical temperatures and adaptive seasonality in more detail in three northern forest ecoprovinces. In the Northern and Middle Rockies, areas of adaptive seasonality decreased at lower elevations and increased at higher elevations during warmer periods, resulting in a movement upward in elevation of adaptive seasonality. In contrast, the Cascade Mountains exhibited overall declines in adaptive seasonality with higher temperatures regardless of elevation. Projections of future warming (5 degrees C in the western United States) resulted in substantial reductions in the overall area of adaptive seasonality. At the highest elevations, predicted warmer conditions will result in increases in the area of adaptive seasonality. Our findings suggest that future climate change may alter forest ecosystems indirectly through alteration of these important disturbances."
twentieth-century decline in streamflows from the hydrographic apex of north america,"The Rocky Mountain region near the Canada-United States border provides the North American hydrographic apex with headwater streams flowing to the Pacific, Arctic and Atlantic oceans. The area contains numerous national parks and protected areas with relatively pristine watersheds that permit analyses of historic streamflow patterns with minimal human impacts that would alter hydraulic linkages between precipitation and river discharge. Consequently, we analyzed patterns of mean annual discharge (Q(a)) from 31 river reaches that were generally free-flowing with hydrologic records typically commencing in the 1910s and extending to about 2002. To maximize the records of six rivers we undertook regression analyses to extrapolate Q(a) from sequential hydrometric gauges or from early, summer-only Q data. Spearman rho and Kendall tau b non-parametric correlations and a parametric approach involving linear regressions combined with analyses of variance were highly consistent in detecting significant historic trends in Q(a) and the regression analyses estimated the trend magnitudes. These analyses revealed flow declines (exceeding 0.1%/year over the historic record) for 21 reaches (5 with p<0.1, 10 with p<0.05), while 10 rivers displayed little change (<0.1%/year and not significant). Flow declines were prominent for the Alberta rivers, which flow to Hudson Bay and the Arctic Ocean, and also observed for some Pacific and Atlantic drainages. Overall, the rivers displayed a mean Q(a) reduction of 0.22%/year (median = -0.17%/year) and four rivers had recent decline rates exceeding 0.5%/year. The progressive decline was superimposed on an approximately half-century oscillation in streamflow that was strongly associated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. Following from the observed river flow decline over the past century, it is likely that there will be continuing decline in future decades; this prediction contrasts with many current climate change forecasts. Historic and continuing reductions in these streamflows will impact aquatic and riparian ecosystems and diminish water supplies for irrigation. industrial and domestic use, and hydroelectric power generation, with effects extending from these mountain headwaters downstream through other ecoregions.

insect seasonality: circle map analysis of temperature-driven life cycles,"Maintaining an adaptive seasonality, with life cycle events occurring at appropriate times of year and in synchrony with cohorts and ephemeral resources, is a basic ecological requisite for many cold-blooded organisms. There are many mechanisms for synchronizing developmental milestones, such as egg laying (oviposition), egg hatching, cocoon opening, and the emergence of adults. These are often irreversible, specific to particular life stages, and include diapause, an altered physiological state which can be reversed by some synchronizing environmental cue (e.g. photoperiod). However, many successful organisms display none of these mechanisms for maintaining adaptive seasonality. In this paper, we briefly review the mathematical relationship between environmental temperatures and developmental timing and discuss the consequences of viewing these models as circle maps from the cycle of yearly oviposition dates and temperatures to oviposition dates for subsequent generations. Of particular interest biologically are life cycles which are timed to complete in exactly 1 year, or univoltine cycles. Univoltinism, associated with reproductive success for many temperate species, is related to stable fixed points of the developmental circle map. Univoltine fixed points are stable and robust in broad temperature bands, but lose stability suddenly to maladaptive cycles at the edges of these bands. Adaptive seasonality may therefore break down with little warning with constantly increasing or decreasing temperature change, as in scenarios for global warming. These ideas are illustrated and explored in the context of Mountain Pine Beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) occurring in the marginal thermal habitat of central Idaho's Rocky Mountains. Applications of these techniques have not been widely explored by the applied math community, but are likely to provide great insight into the response of biological systems to climate change.

"evaluating the use of a gridded climate surface for modelling groundwater recharge in a semi-arid region (okanagan basin, canada)","Spatially distributed groundwater recharge was simulated for a segment of a semi-arid valley using three different treatments of meteorological input data and potential evapotranspiration (PET). For the same area, timeframe, land cover characteristics and soil properties, groundwater recharge was estimate using (i) single-station climate data with monthly PET calculated by the Thornthwaite method; (ii) single-station climate data with daily PET calculated by the Penman-Monteith method; and (iii) daily gridded climate data with spatially distributed PET calculated using the Penman-Monteith method. For each treatment, the magnitude and distribution of actual evapotranspiration (AET) for summer months compared well with those estimated for a 5-year crop study, suggesting that the near-surface hydrological processes were replicated and that subsequent groundwater recharge rates are realistic. However, for winter months, calculated AET was near zero when using the Thornthwaite PET method. Mean annual groundwater recharge varied from similar to 3.2 to 10.0 mm when PET was calculated by the Thornthwaite method, and from similar to 1.8 to 7.5 mm when PET was calculated by the Penman-Monteith method. Comparisons of bivariate plots of seasonal recharge rates estimated from single-station versus gridded surface climate reveal that there is greater variability between the different methods for spring months, which is the season of greatest recharge. Furthermore, these seasonal differences are shown to provide different results when compared to the depth to water table, which could lead to different results of evaporative extinction depth. These findings illustrate potential consequences of using different approaches for representing spatial meteorological input data, which could provide conflicting predictions when modelling the influence of climate change on groundwater recharge.

changes in snowmelt runoff timing in western north america under a 'business as usual' climate change scenario,"Spring snowmelt is the most important contribution of many rivers in western North America. If climate changes, this contribution may change. A shift in the timing of springtime snowmelt towards earlier in the year already is observed during 1948 - 2000 in many western rivers. Streamflow timing changes for the 1995 - 2099 period are projected using regression relations between observed streamflow-timing responses in each river, measured by the temporal centroid of streamflow (CT) each year, and local temperature (TI) and precipitation ( PI) indices. Under 21st century warming trends predicted by the Parallel Climate Model (PCM) under business-as-usual greenhouse-gas emissions, streamflow timing trends across much of western North America suggest even earlier springtime snowmelt than observed to date. Projected CT changes are consistent with observed rates and directions of change during the past five decades, and are strongest in the Pacific Northwest, Sierra Nevada, and Rocky Mountains, where many rivers eventually run 30 - 40 days earlier. The modest PI changes projected by PCM yield minimal CT changes. The responses of CT to the simultaneous effects of projected TI and PI trends are dominated by the TI changes. Regression-based CT projections agree with those from physically-based simulations of rivers in the Pacific Northwest and Sierra Nevada."
hydroclimate of the western united states based on observations and regional climate simulation of 1981-2000 part ii: mesoscale enso anomalies,"The hydroclimate of the western United States is influenced by strong interannual variability of atmospheric circulation, much of which is associated with the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Precipitation anomalies during ENSO often show opposite and spatially coherent dry and wet patterns in the Northwest and California or vice versa. The role of orography in establishing mesoscale ENSO anomalies in the western United States is examined based on observed precipitation and temperature data at 1/8degrees spatial resolution and a regional climate simulation at 40-km spatial resolution. Results show that during El Nino or La Nina winters, strong precipitation anomalies are found in northern California, along the southern California coast, and in the northwest mountains such as the Olympic Mountains, the Cascades, and the northern Rockies. These spatial features, which are strongly affected by topography, are surprisingly well reproduced by the regional climate simulation. A spatial feature investigated further is the positive - negative - positive precipitation anomaly found during El Nino years in the Olympic Mountains, and on the west side and east side of the Cascades in both observations and regional simulation. Observed streamflows of river basins located in those areas are found to be consistent with the precipitation anomalies. The spatial distribution of the precipitation anomalies is investigated by relating flow direction and moisture to the orientation of mountains and orographic precipitation. On the west side of the north - south-oriented Cascade Range, the increase in atmospheric moisture is not enough to compensate for the loss of orographic precipitation associated with a change in flow direction toward the southwest during El Nino years. In California, both the increase in atmospheric moisture and shift in wind direction toward the southwest enhance precipitation along the Sierra, which is oriented northwest to southeast. The spatial signature of the interactions between large-scale circulation and topography may provide useful information for seasonal predictions or climate change detection."
a comparison of delta change and downscaled gcm scenarios for three mountainous basins in the united states,"Simulated daily precipitation, temperature, and runoff time series were compared in three mountainous basins in the United States: (1) the Animas River basin in Colorado, (2) the East Fork of the Carson River basin in Nevada and California, and (3) the Cle Elum River basin in Washington State. Two methods of climate scenario generation were compared: delta change and statistical downscaling. The delta change method uses differences between simulated current and future climate conditions from the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research (HadCM2) General Circulation Model (GCM) added to observed time series of climate variables. A statistical downscaling (SDS) model was developed for each basin using station data and output from the National Center for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) reanalysis regridded to the scale of HadCM2. The SDS model was then used to simulate local climate variables using HadCM2 output for current and future conditions. Surface climate variables from each scenario were used in a precipitation-runoff model. Results from this study show that, in the basins tested, a precipitation-runoff model can simulate realistic runoff series for current conditions using statistically downscaled NCEP output. But, use of downscaled HadCM2 output for current or future climate assessments are questionable because the GCM does not produce accurate estimates of the surface variables needed for runoff in these regions. Given the uncertainties in the GCMs ability to simulate current conditions based on either the delta change or downscaling approaches, future climate assessments based on either of these approaches must be treated with caution."
potential climate chance impacts on mountain watersheds in the pacific northwest,"Global climate change due to the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has serious potential impacts on water resources in the Pacific Northwest. Climate scenarios produced by general circulation models (GCMs) do not provide enough spatial specificity for studying water resources in mountain watersheds. This study uses dynamical downscaling with a regional climate model (RCM) driven by a GCM to simulate climate change scenarios. The RCM uses a subgrid parameterization of orographic precipitation and land surface cover to simulate surface climate at the spatial scale suitable for the representation of topographic effects over mountainous regions. Numerical experiments have been performed to simulate the present-day climatology and the climate conditions corresponding to a doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentration. The RCM results indicate an average warming of about 2.5 degrees C, and precipitation generally increases over the Pacific Northwest and decreases over California. These simulations were used to drive a distributed hydrology model of two snow dominated watersheds, the American River and Middle Fork Flathead, in the Pacific Northwest to obtain more detailed estimates of the sensitivity of water resources to climate change. Results show that as more precipitation falls as rain rather than snow in the warmer climate, there is a 60 percent reduction in snowpack and a significant shift in the seasonal pattern of streamflow in the American River. Much less drastic changes are found in the Middle Fork Flathead where snowpack is only reduced by 18 percent and the seasonal pattern of streamflow remains intact. This study shows that the impacts of climate change on water resources are highly region specific. Furthermore, under the specific climate change scenario, the impacts are largely driven by the warming trend rather than the precipitation trend, which is small."
"changes in glacier and alpine runoff in the north cascade range, washington, usa 1985-1993","From 1985 to 1993, the mean summer temperature was 1.1 degrees C above the long-term mean and the mean winter precipitation was 11% below the long-term mean at the eight Washington State Cascade Mountain weather stations. The effect of this climate fluctuation on glacier and alpine runoff has been examined in five North Cascade basins. From 1985 to 1993 the two basins with less than 1% glacier-covered area experienced mean 1 July to 30 September (late summer) runoff 36% below the long-term mean. The three moderately glaciated basins (3, 6 and 14% glaciated, respectively) experienced a 13% decline in late summer runoff for the same period. A significant change in late summer runoff has occurred in the North Cascades and this change is less pronounced in glacier basins. The cause of the change is decreased winter precipitation and earlier onset of spring melting of the alpine snowpack, followed by above average summer temperatures and an earlier summer melt of alpine snowpack. The smaller decrease in runoff in glacial basins is due to increased ablation and consequent glacier runoff due to high summer temperatures. However, glacier retreat is also reducing glacier runoff."
"tree mortality from drought, insects, and their interactions in a changing climate","Climate change is expected to drive increased tree mortality through drought, heat stress, and insect attacks, with manifold impacts on forest ecosystems. Yet, climate-induced tree mortality and biotic disturbance agents are largely absent from process-based ecosystem models. Using data sets from the western USA and associated studies, we present a framework for determining the relative contribution of drought stress, insect attack, and their interactions, which is critical for modeling mortality in future climates. We outline a simple approach that identifies the mechanisms associated with two guilds of insects - bark beetles and defoliators - which are responsible for substantial tree mortality. We then discuss cross-biome patterns of insect-driven tree mortality and draw upon available evidence contrasting the prevalence of insect outbreaks in temperate and tropical regions. We conclude with an overview of tools and promising avenues to address major challenges. Ultimately, a multitrophic approach that captures tree physiology, insect populations, and tree-insect interactions will better inform projections of forest ecosystem responses to climate change."
contrasting distribution patterns of invasive and naturalized non-native species along environmental gradients in a semi-arid montane ecosystem,"QuestionsMountain systems have high abiotic heterogeneity over local spatial scales, offering natural experiments for examining plant species invasions. We ask whether functional groupings explain non-native species spread into native vegetation and up elevation gradients. We examine whether non-native species distribution patterns are related to environmental variables after controlling for elevation and, thus, driven by niche processes. LocationThe Wallowa Mountains, northeast Oregon, USA. MethodsWe surveyed non-native plant species along three mountain roads and into the native habitat matrix to assess the extent of invasion success along distance from roadside and elevation gradients. We used GLM to predict single species occurrence probabilities, LMM to examine differences in distribution patterns among functional types, and pCCA to examine multivariate responses of the non-native community to ecological variables. ResultsProbability of occurrence of the eight focal invasive species was not significantly related to distance from the road, but declined with elevation. Non-native species with annual life history strategies were more restricted to lower elevations than perennial species. Non-native species considered invasive occurred at lower minimum elevations than naturalized species. Shifts in the species composition of the non-native plant community were related to changes in soil and climate variables. ConclusionsOur results suggest that invasive species have similar patterns of habitat associations and spread from roadsides to interior vegetation zones, whereas naturalized species partition environmental gradients in this semi-arid montane ecosystem. Furthermore, annual and invasive species groups occupy lower elevations and perennial and naturalized species groups have invaded further up the mountain roads and into the native vegetation. Thus, functional groupings may explain contrasting distribution patterns of non-native species and could be used to inform management strategies for non-native species."
the controversial management of fire in the national forests of idaho and western montana,"In Idaho and Montana just like in the rest of the U.S. Rocky Mountains, a part of the population wants to settle near forests perceived as environmental amenities. The regional net migration has been positive for about twenty-five years. Wildfires with variable intensity regularly destroy properties. Some of them kill people. Regionally, they are an important human, economic, political and environmental issue. Their significance is likely to increase due to global warming. A lot of these fires are ignited within the huge national forests of the montane zone ( 600 to 2,100 meters of elevation in the study area) dominated by Ponderosa pines and Douglas firs. Between the end of the conquest of the West and the 1970s, land uses have altered these forests and the fire regimes that affect them. For about four decades, managers have been involved in a partial and controversial restoration of pre-conquest fire regimes and forests they used to shape."
"managing for climate change on federal lands of the western united states: perceived usefulness of climate science, effectiveness of adaptation strategies, and barriers to implementation","Recent mandates in the United States require federal agencies to incorporate climate change science into land management planning efforts. These mandates target possible adaptation and mitigation strategies. However, the degree to which climate change is actively being considered in agency planning and management decisions is largely unknown. We explored the usefulness of climate change science for federal resource managers, focusing on the efficacy of potential adaptation strategies and barriers limiting the use of climate change science in adaptation efforts. Our study was conducted in the northern Rocky Mountains region of the western United States, where we interacted with 77 U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management personnel through surveys, semistructured interviews, and four collaborative workshops at locations across Idaho and Montana. We used a mixed-methods approach to evaluate managers' perceptions about adapting to and mitigating for climate change. Although resource managers incorporate general language about climate change in regional and landscape-level planning documents, they are currently not planning on-the-ground adaptation or mitigation projects. However, managers felt that their organizations were most likely to adapt to climate change through use of existing management strategies that are already widely implemented for other non climate-related management goals. These existing strategies, (e.g., thinning and prescribed burning) are perceived as more feasible than new climate-specific methods (e.g., assisted migration) because they already have public and agency support, accomplish multiple goals, and require less anticipation of the future timing and probability of climate change impacts. Participants reported that the most common barriers to using climate change information included a lack of management-relevant climate change science, inconsistent agency guidance, and insufficient time and resources to access, interpret, and apply current climate science information to management plans."
"debris flow initiation in proglacial gullies on mount rainier, washington","Effects of climate change, retreating glaciers, and changing storm patterns on debris flow hazards concern managers in the Cascade Range (USA) and mountainous areas worldwide. During an intense rainstorm in November 2006, seven debris flows initiated from proglacial gullies of separate basins on the flanks of Mount Rainier. Gully heads at glacier termini and widespread failure of gully walls imply that overland flow was transformed into debris flow along gullies. We characterized gully change and morphology, and assessed spatial distributions of debris flows to infer the processes and conditions for debris flow initiation. Slopes at gully heads were greater than similar to 0.35 m m(-1) (19 degrees) and exhibited a significant negative relationship with drainage area. A break in slope-drainage area trends among debris flow gullies also occurs at similar to 0.35 m m(-1), representing a possible transition to fluvial sediment transport and erosion. An interpreted hybrid model of debris flow initiation involves bed failure near gully heads followed by sediment recruitment from gully walls along gully lengths. Estimates of sediment volume loss from gully walls demonstrate the importance of sediment inputs along gullies for increasing debris flow volumes. Basin comparisons revealed significantly steeper drainage networks and higher elevations in debris flow-producing than non-debris flow-producing proglacial areas. The high slopes and elevations of debris flow-producing proglacial areas reflect positive slope-elevation trends for the Mount Rainier volcano. Glacier extent therefore controls the slope distribution in proglacial areas, and thus potential for debris flow generation. As a result, debris flow activity may increase as glacier termini retreat onto slopes inclined at angles above debris flow initiation thresholds. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
diversifying managed forests to increase resilience,"In British Columbia, Canada, a recent epidemic of mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins, 1902) caused widespread forest mortality. This epidemic was due in part to the changing climate, and damage from pests and diseases is expected to increase in the future. Therefore, we used a historical retrospective approach as a proxy to evaluate management options on reducing the forest health damage that may occur under a future changing climate. We assessed two landscape-scale strategies, intended to increase tree species diversity, for the response in ecosystem resilience and compared the results with the business-as-usual strategy. The assessment was based on simulation modelling of the Merritt Timber Supply Area for 1980-2060. We applied a strategy to increase the harvest of the most dominant tree species, plant more diverse species, and increase natural regeneration. This strategy resulted in greater ecological resilience (higher diversity and growing stocks), higher harvest rates, and higher, more consistent net revenue over time than the business-as-usual strategy or the strategy that only employed a diversity of planting. A sensitivity analysis indicated a high level of robustness in the results. Our study showed that it may not be necessary to compromise economic viability to reduce forest health risks and consequently improve socio-ecological resilience."
an assessment of methods and remote-sensing derived covariates for regional predictions of 1 km daily maximum air temperature,"The monitoring and prediction of biodiversity and environmental changes is constrained by the availability of accurate and spatially contiguous climatic variables at fine temporal and spatial grains. In this study, we evaluate best practices for generating gridded, one-kilometer resolution, daily maximum air temperature surfaces in a regional context, the state of Oregon, USA. Covariates used in the interpolation include remote sensing derived elevation, aspect, canopy height, percent forest cover and MODIS Land Surface Temperature (LST). Because of missing values, we aggregated daily LST values as long term (2000-2010) monthly climatologies to leverage its spatial detail in the interpolation. We predicted temperature with three methods-Universal Kriging, Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) and Generalized Additive Models (GAM)-and assessed predictions using meteorological stations over 365 days in 2010. We find that GAM is least sensitive to overtraining (overfitting) and results in lowest errors in term of distance to closest training stations. Mean elevation, LST, and distance to ocean are flagged most frequently as significant covariates among all daily predictions. Results indicate that GAM with latitude, longitude and elevation is the top model but that LST has potential in providing additional fine-grained spatial structure related to land cover effects. The study also highlights the need for more rigorous methods and data to evaluate the spatial structure and fine grained accuracy of predicted surfaces."
behavior and nutritional condition buffer a large-bodied endotherm against direct and indirect effects of climate,"Temporal changes in net energy balance of animals strongly influence fitness; consequently, natural selection should favor behaviors that increase net energy balance by buffering individuals against negative effects of environmental variation. The relative importance of behavioral responses to climate-induced variation in costs vs. supplies of energy, however, is uncertain, as is the degree to which such responses are mediated by current stores of energy. We evaluated relationships among behavior, nutritional condition (i.e., energy state), and spatiotemporal variation in costs vs. supplies of energy available to a large-bodied endotherm, the North American elk (Cervus elaphus), occupying two ecosystems with contrasting climates and energy landscapes: a temperate, montane forest and an arid, high-elevation desert. We hypothesized that during spring through autumn, behavioral responses to the energy landscape would be both context dependent (i.e., would vary as a function of the contrasting environmental conditions experienced by elk in the forest vs. the desert), and state dependent (i.e., would vary as a function of the energy balance of an individual). We tested several predictions derived from that hypothesis by combining output from a biophysical model of the thermal environment with data on forage quality, animal locations, and nutritional condition of individuals. At the population level, elk in the desert selected areas that reduced costs of thermoregulation over those that provided the highest-quality forage. In the forest, however, costs imposed by the thermal environment were less pronounced, and elk selected areas that increased access to high-quality forage over those that reduced costs of thermoregulation. At the individual level, nutritional condition did not influence strength of selection for low-cost areas or high-quality forage among elk in the forest. In the desert, however, strength of selection for low-cost areas (but not forage quality) was state dependent; individuals in the poorest condition at the end of winter showed the strongest selection for areas that reduced costs of thermoregulation during spring and summer, and also expended the least amount of energy on locomotion. Our results highlight the importance of understanding the roles of behavior and nutritional condition in buffering endotherms against direct and indirect effects of climate on fitness."
idiosyncratic responses of grizzly bear habitat to climate change based on projected food resource changes,"Climate change vulnerability assessments for species of conservation concern often use species distribution and ecological niche modeling to project changes in habitat. One of many assumptions of these approaches is that food web dependencies are consistent in time and environmental space. Species at higher trophic levels that rely on the availability of species at lower trophic levels as food may be sensitive to extinction cascades initiated by changes in the habitat of key food resources. Here we assess climate change vulnerability for Ursus arctos (grizzly bears) in the southern Canadian Rocky Mountains using projected changes to 17 of the most commonly consumed plant food items. We used presence-absence information from 7088 field plots to estimate ecological niches and to project changes in future distributions of each species. Model projections indicated idiosyncratic responses among food items. Many food items persisted or even increased, although several species were found to be vulnerable based on declines or geographic shifts in suitable habitat. These included Hedysarum alpinum (alpine sweet vetch), a critical spring and autumn root-digging resource when little else is available. Potential habitat loss was also identified for three fruiting species of lower importance to bears: Empetrum nigrum (crowberry), Vaccinium scoparium (grouseberry), and Fragaria virginiana (strawberry). A general trend towards uphill migration of bear foods may result in higher vulnerability to bear populations at low elevations, which are also those that are most likely to have human-bear conflict problems. Regardless, a wide diet breadth of grizzly bears, as well as wide environmental niches of most food items, make climate change a much lower threat to grizzly bears than other bear species such as polar bears and panda bears. We cannot exclude, however, future alterations in human behavior and land use resulting from climate change that may reduce survival rates."
"evidence of climate-induced range contractions in bull trout salvelinus conflentus in a rocky mountain watershed, us.a.","Many freshwater fish species are considered vulnerable to stream temperature warming associated with climate change because they are ectothermic, yet there are surprisingly few studies documenting changes in distributions. Streams and rivers in the U.S. Rocky Mountains have been warming for several decades. At the same time these systems have been experiencing an increase in the severity and frequency of wildfires, which often results in habitat changes including increased water temperatures. We resampled 74 sites across a Rocky Mountain watershed 17 to 20 years after initial samples to determine whether there were trends in bull trout occurrence associated with temperature, wildfire, or other habitat variables. We found that site abandonment probabilities (0.36) were significantly higher than colonization probabilities (0.13), which indicated a reduction in the number of occupied sites. Site abandonment probabilities were greater at low elevations with warm temperatures. Other covariates, such as the presence of wildfire, nonnative brook trout, proximity to areas with many adults, and various stream habitat descriptors, were not associated with changes in probability of occupancy. Higher abandonment probabilities at low elevation for bull trout provide initial evidence validating the predictions made by bioclimatic models that bull trout populations will retreat to higher, cooler thermal refuges as water temperatures increase. The geographic breadth of these declines across the region is unknown but the approach of revisiting historical sites using an occupancy framework provides a useful template for additional assessments."
"hydrologic landscape classification evaluates streamflow vulnerability to climate change in oregon, usa","Classification can allow for evaluations of the hydrologic functions of landscapes and their responses to stressors. Here we demonstrate the use of a hydrologic landscape (HL) approach to evaluate vulnerability to potential future climate change at statewide and basin scales in the state of Oregon. The HL classification has five components: climate, seasonality, aquifer permeability, terrain, and soil permeability. We evaluate changes when the 1971-2000 HL climate indices are recalculated using 2041-2070 simulation results from the ECHAM (European Centre HAMburg) and PCM (Parallel Climate Model) climate models with the A2, A1b, and B1 emission scenarios. Changes in climate class were modest (4-18%) statewide. However, there were major changes in seasonality class for five of the six realizations (excluding PCM_B1): Oregon shifts from being 13% snow-dominated to 4-6% snow-dominated under these five realizations, representing a 56-68% reduction in snowmelt-dominated area. At the basin scale, simulated changes for the Siletz Basin, in Oregon's Coast Range, include a small switch from very wet to wet climate, with no change in seasonality. However, there is a modest increase in fall and winter water due to increased precipitation. For the Sandy Basin, on the western slope of the Cascades, HL climate class does not change, but there are major changes in seasonality, especially for areas with low aquifer permeability, which experiences a 100% loss of spring seasonality. This would reduce summer baseflow, but effects could potentially be mitigated by streamflow buffering effects provided by groundwater in the high aquifer permeability portions of the upper Sandy. The Middle Fork John Day Basin (MFJD), in northeastern Oregon, is snowmelt-dominated. The basin experiences a net loss of wet and moist climate area, along with an increase in dry climate area. The MFJD also experiences major shifts from spring to winter seasonality, representing a 20-60% reduction in snowmelt-dominated area. Altered seasonality and/or magnitude of seasonal streamflows could potentially affect survival, growth and reproduction of salmonids in these watersheds, with the greatest effects projected for the MFJD. A major strength of the HL approach is that results can be applied to similarly classified, ungaged basins. Information resulting from such evaluations can help inform management responses to climate change at regional and basin scales without requiring detailed modeling efforts."
"determinants of moth diversity and community in a temperate mountain landscape: vegetation, topography, and seasonality","Macromoth diversity, abundance, and community structure in the topographically complex HJ Andrews Experimental Forest and LTER site was studied on the west slope of the Cascade Range, Oregon. Data on 493 macromoth species (62,221 individuals) was sampled eight times/year at 20 locations from 2004 to 2008 and examined using multivariate statistics and generalized additive models to determine the importance of topography and vegetation on moth community assembly and diversity. Significant differences exist between moth communities at lower and higher elevations. High-elevation moth communities are far more variable inter-annually, whether associated with high-elevation forests, meadows, or clearcuts. Low-elevation young and old gymnosperm forests and riparian forests are more stable and predictable communities having less inter-annual variability. High-elevation communities show more intra-annual variability than low-elevation communities. Low-elevation moth communities are more abundant than high-elevation communities and typically associated with the most common, abundant species of macromoths in the study. High-elevation communities, by contrast, are associated with less abundant, more evenly distributed species, as well as with rare moth species. Macromoth community structure and diversity were related to year or sample period and structural descriptions of vegetation communities, but not related to known host-plant diversity. High-elevation communities are threatened by contraction of montane meadows and climate change which, given the variability in high-elevation communities, could severely impact the biological diversity of the western Cascades landscape. Nocturnal macromoths represent an important potential indicator of ecosystem health and change."
the uneven response of different snow measures to human-induced climate warming,"The effect of human-induced climate warming on different snow measures in the western United States is compared by calculating the time required to achieve a statistically significant linear trend in the different measures, using time series derived from regionally downscaled global climate models. The measures examined include the water content of the spring snowpack, total cold-season snowfall, fraction of winter precipitation that falls as snow, length of the snow season, and fraction of cold-season precipitation retained in the spring snowpack, as well as temperature and precipitation. Various stakeholders may be interested in different sets of these variables. It is found that temperature and the fraction of winter precipitation that falls as snow exhibit significant trends first, followed in 5-10 years by the fraction of cold-season precipitation retained in the spring snowpack, and later still by the water content of the spring snowpack. Change in total cold-season snowfall is least detectable of all the measures, since it is strongly linked to precipitation, which has large natural variability and only a weak anthropogenic trend in the western United States. Averaging over increasingly wider areas monotonically increases the signal-to-noise ratio of the 1950-2025 linear trend from 0.15 to 0.37, depending on the snow measure."
tree species selection revisited for plantations in the interior cedar hemlock zone of southern british columbia,"We provide results from two trials comparing performance of species of known provenance planted on logged sites in the southern Interior Cedar Hemlock biogeoclimatic zone of southern British Columbia 20 and 26 years after establishment. The commonly used plantation species, lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia), interior spruce (a naturally occurring hybrid between Picea glauca and P. engelmannii) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca), survived as well as, but grew more slowly than, western larch (Larix occidentalis), western white pine (Pinus monticola) and ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), and faster than western redcedar (Thuja plicata). Site index values were generally higher than published values for similar sites. Numerous pests affected all species in the trials. Mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) caused heavy mortality in lodgepole pine in part of one trial, and Armillaria root disease caused widespread damage to western larch and Douglas-fir in the other trial. Western white pine from local seed sources were severely damaged by white pine blister rust (Cronartium ribicola) in both trials but a rust-resistant seed source used in one trial survived better. Frost damage reduced survival and growth of Douglas-fir in one trial and may have affected western white pine. Survival of two planted broadleaves (Betula papyrifera) and a hybrid of black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa) and black poplar (Populus nigra) was severely reduced by drought. The results support ongoing efforts to broaden the number of species used in British Columbia reforestation programs."
influence of spatial temperature estimation method in ecohydrologic modeling in the western oregon cascades,"Most spatially explicit hydrologic models require estimates of air temperature patterns. For these models, empirical relationships between elevation and air temperature are frequently used to upscale point measurements or downscale regional and global climate model estimates of air temperature. Mountainous environments are particularly sensitive to air temperature estimates as spatial gradients are substantial, and air temperature plays a critical role in snow-related processes. We use a distributed, coupled ecohydrologic model to compare estimates of streamflow, snowmelt, transpiration, and net primary productivity (NPP) using five temperature interpolation approaches for a forested mountain basin that is dominated by a rain-snow zone in Western Oregon, USA. We compare model estimates using a standard adiabatic lapse rate of -6.5 degrees C km(-1); basin-specific lapse rates created using daily point observations at high, middle, and low elevations; and gridded temperature estimates from the Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) derived at 800 and 50 m resolutions. We show that temperature interpolation strategies influence model calibration. Point-based estimates using a low-elevation station or 800 m PRISM grids result in significantly fewer parameter sets that model streamflow well, suggesting a bias in parameter selection due to errors in input data. The greatest postcalibration impact of temperature lapse rate estimates occurs for model estimates of NPP. The constant temperature lapse rate results in substantially reduced NPP estimates that are more sensitive to the interannual variation in climate forcing. Citation: Garcia, E. S., C. L.

"climate change or climate cycles? snowpack trends in the olympic and cascade mountains, washington, usa","Climate change could significantly influence seasonal streamflow and water availability in the snowpack-fed watersheds of Washington, USA. Descriptions of snowpack decline often use linear ordinary least squares (OLS) models to quantify this change. However, the region's precipitation is known to be related to climate cycles. If snowpack decline is more closely related to these cycles, an OLS model cannot account for this effect, and thus both descriptions of trends and estimates of decline could be inaccurate. We used intervention analysis to determine whether snow water equivalent (SWE) in 25 long-term snow courses within the Olympic and Cascade Mountains are more accurately described by OLS (to represent gradual change), stationary (to represent no change), or step-stationary (to represent climate cycling) models. We used Bayesian information-theoretic methods to determine these models' relative likelihood, and we found 90 models that could plausibly describe the statistical structure of the 25 snow courses' time series. Posterior model probabilities of the 29 ""most plausible"" models ranged from 0.33 to 0.91 (mean = 0.58, s = 0.15). The majority of these time series (55 %) were best represented as step-stationary models with a single breakpoint at 1976/77, coinciding with a major shift in the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. However, estimates of SWE decline differed by as much as 35 % between statistically plausible models of a single time series. This ambiguity is a critical problem for water management policy. Approaches such as intervention analysis should become part of the basic analytical toolkit for snowpack or other climatic time series data."
multi-scale drivers of spatial variation in old-growth forest carbon density disentangled with lidar and an individual-based landscape model,"Forest ecosystems are the most important terrestrial carbon (C) storage globally, and presently mitigate anthropogenic climate change by acting as a large and persistent sink for atmospheric CO2. Yet, forest C density varies greatly in space, both globally and at stand and landscape levels. Understanding the multi-scale drivers of this variation is a prerequisite for robust and effective climate change mitigation in ecosystem management. Here, we used airborne light detection and ranging (Lidar) and a novel high-resolution simulation model of landscape dynamics (iLand) to identify the drivers of variation in C density for an old-growth forest landscape in Oregon, USA. With total ecosystem C in excess of 1 Gt ha(-1) these ecosystems are among the most C-rich globally. Our findings revealed considerable spatial variability in stand-level C density across the landscape. Notwithstanding the distinct environmental gradients in our mountainous study area only 55.3% of this variation was explained by environmental drivers, with radiation and soil physical properties having a stronger influence than temperature and precipitation. The remaining variation in C stocks was largely attributable to emerging properties of stand dynamics (that is, stand structure and composition). Not only were density- and size-related indicators positively associated with C stocks but also diversity in composition and structure, documenting a close link between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. We conclude that the complexity of old-growth forests contributes to their sustained high C levels, a finding that is relevant to managing forests for climate change mitigation."
climate and weather influences on spatial temporal patterns of mountain pine beetle populations in washington and oregon,"Widespread outbreaks of mountain pine beetle in North America have drawn the attention of scientists, forest managers, and the public. There is strong evidence that climate change has contributed to the extent and severity of recent outbreaks. Scientists are interested in quantifying relationships between bark beetle population dynamics and trends in climate. Process models that simulate climate suitability for mountain pine beetle outbreaks have advanced our understanding of beetle population dynamics; however, there are few studies that have assessed their accuracy across multiple outbreaks or at larger spatial scales. This study used the observed number of trees killed by mountain pine beetles per square kilometer in Oregon and Washington, USA, over the past three decades to quantify and assess the influence of climate and weather variables on beetle activity over longer time periods and larger scales than previously studied. Influences of temperature and precipitation in addition to process model output variables were assessed at annual and climatological time scales. The statistical analysis showed that new attacks are more likely to occur at locations with climatological mean August temperatures >15 degrees C. After controlling for beetle pressure, the variables with the largest effect on the odds of an outbreak exceeding a certain size were minimum winter temperature (positive relationship) and drought conditions in current and previous years. Precipitation levels in the year prior to the outbreak had a positive effect, possibly an indication of the influence of this driver on brood size. Two-year cumulative precipitation had a negative effect, a possible indication of the influence of drought on tree stress. Among the process model variables, cold tolerance was the strongest indicator of an outbreak increasing to epidemic size. A weather suitability index developed from the regression analysis indicated a 2.5x increase in the odds of outbreak at locations with highly suitable weather vs. locations with low suitability. The models were useful for estimating expected amounts of damage (total area with outbreaks) and for quantifying the contribution of climate to total damage. Overall, the results confirm the importance of climate and weather on the spatial expansion of bark beetle outbreaks over time."
projecting future distributions of ecosystem climate niches: uncertainties and management applications,"Projecting future distributions of ecosystems or species climate niches has widely been used to assess the potential impacts of climate change. However, variability in such projections for the future periods, particularly the variability arising from uncertain future climates, remains a critical challenge for incorporating these projections into climate change adaptation strategies. We combined the use of a robust statistical modeling technique with a simple consensus approach consolidating projected outcomes for multiple climate change scenarios, and exemplify how the results could guide reforestation planning. Random Forest (RF) was used to model relationships between climate (1961-1990), described by 44 variables, and the geographic distribution of 16 major ecosystem types in British Columbia (BC), Canada. The model predicted current ecosystem distributions with high accuracy (mismatch rate = 4-16% for most ecosystem classes). It was then used to predict the distribution of ecosystem climate niches for the last decade (2001-2009) and project future distributions for 20 climate change scenarios. We found that geographic distributions of the suitable climate habitats for BC ecosystems have already shifted in 23% of BC since the 1970s. Consensus projections for future periods (2020s, 2050s, 2080s) indicated climates suitable for grasslands, dry forests, and moist continental cedar-hemlock forests would substantially expand; climate habitat for coastal rainforests would remain relatively stable; and habitat for boreal, subalpine and alpine ecosystems would decrease substantially. Using these consensus projections and data on the occurrence of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii [Mirb.] Franco) in BC ecosystems, we estimated a twofold increase in seedling demand for this frost-sensitive, commercially important timber species, suggesting managers could begin planning to expand seed inventories and seed orchard capacity to more widely plant this species on logged sites. The results of this work demonstrate the power of RF for building climate envelope models and illustrate the utility of consensus projections for incorporating uncertainty about future climate into management planning. It also emphasizes the immediate need for adapting natural resource management to a changing climate. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
climate effects on red alder growth in the pacific northwest of north america,"We investigated the effects of climate on the growth of red alder across a broad latitudinal gradient and over a wide range of growing conditions in the Pacific Northwest of North America (PNW). Data for this study came from a study established in 1988 that includes 31 research installations located between the Pacific Coast and the Cascade Mountains in Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia. The growth-climate model developed includes: summer heat moisture index (SHM), mean warmest month temperature (MWMT), spring precipitation (PPTsp), and initial height; and captures 78% of the variation in red alder volume increment. Based on this model, estimates of potential future growth were generated for three climate scenarios (i.e., cccma_cgcm3_A2-run4 'warm and wet' of the Canadian Centre for Climate Modeling and Analysis; and ukmo_hadcm3_B1-run1 'cool and moist' and ukmo_HadGEM1_A1B-run1 'hot and dry' of the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research). These projections indicate a potential increase in volume increment of up-to 12% by the 2080s. Range-wide maps were generated for the volume increment potential (VIP) for the reference normal period 1961-1990, for the 'warm and wet' climate scenario, and the 2050s time period, suggesting that climate change may cause a substantial shift in the range and productivity of red alder in the PNW. In addition, maps of the predicted VIP of red alder for the Campbell River District in BC were generated and indicate an overall increase in projected growth of red alder. This study provides evidence that climate change will likely lead to expansion of the range and potential increases in growth for red alder in conjunction with assisted migration of provenance in the PNW. While these results indicate potential increased opportunities for extension of the range of red alder and opportunities for its management, care must be taken to avoid planting alder on sites with high risk of damaging agents such as cold outflow winds, frost, or drought.

spatial genetic structure of the mountain pine beetle (dendroctonus ponderosae) outbreak in western canada: historical patterns and contemporary dispersal,"Environmental change has a wide range of ecological consequences, including species extinction and range expansion. Many studies have shown that insect species respond rapidly to climatic change. A mountain pine beetle epidemic of record size in North America has led to unprecedented mortality of lodgepole pine, and a significant range expansion to the northeast of its historic range. Our goal was to determine the spatial genetic variation found among outbreak population from which genetic structure, and dispersal patterns may be inferred. Beetles from 49 sampling locations throughout the outbreak area in western Canada were analysed at 13 microsatellite loci. We found significant north-south population structure as evidenced by: (i) Bayesian-based analyses, (ii) north-south genetic relationships and diversity gradients; and (iii) a lack of isolation-by-distance in the northernmost cluster. The north-south structure is proposed to have arisen from the processes of postglacial colonization as well as recent climate-driven changes in population dynamics. Our data support the hypothesis of multiple sources of origin for the outbreak and point to the need for population specific information to improve our understanding and management of outbreaks. The recent range expansion across the Rocky Mountains into the jack/lodgepole hybrid and pure jack pine zones of northern Alberta is consistent with a northern British Columbia origin. We detected no loss of genetic variability in these populations, indicating that the evolutionary potential of mountain pine beetle to adapt has not been reduced by founder events. This study illustrates a rapid range-wide response to the removal of climatic constraints, and the potential for range expansion of a regional population."
"climate change impacts on spatial patterns in drought risk in the willamette river basin, oregon, usa","Climate change is likely to lead more frequent droughts in the Pacific Northwest (PNW) of America. Rising air temperature will reduce winter snowfall and increase earlier snowmelt, subsequently reducing summer flows. Longer crop-growing season caused by higher temperatures will lead to increases in evapotranspiration and irrigation water demand, which could exacerbate drought damage. However, the impacts of climate change on drought risk will vary over space and time. Thus, spatially explicit drought assessment can help water resource managers and planners to better cope with risk. This study seeks to identify possible drought-vulnerable regions in the Willamette River Basin of the PNW. In order to estimate drought risk in a spatially explicit way, relative Standardized Precipitation Index (rSPI) and relative Standardized Runoff Index (rSRI) were employed. Statistically downscaled climate simulations forcing two greenhouse gas emission scenarios, A1B and B1, were used to investigate the possible changes in drought frequency with 3-, 6-, 12-, and 24-month time scales. The results of rSPI and rSRI showed an increase in the short-term frequency of drought due to decreases in summer precipitation and snowmelt. However, long-term drought showed no change or a slight decreasing pattern due to increases in winter precipitation and runoff. According to the local index of spatial autocorrelation analysis, the Willamette Valley region was more vulnerable (hot spot) to drought risk than the mountainous regions of the Western Cascades and the High Cascades (cold spot). Although the hydrology of the Western Cascades and the High Cascades will be affected by climate change, these regions will remain relatively water-rich. This suggests that improving the water transfer system could be a reasonable climate adaptation option. Additionally, these results showed that the spatial patterns of drought risk change were affected by drought indices, such that appropriate drought index selection will be important in future studies of climate impacts on spatial drought risk."
what explains landscape patterns of tree mortality caused by bark beetle outbreaks in greater yellowstone?,"Aim Bark beetle outbreaks have recently affected extensive areas of western North American forests, and factors explaining landscape patterns of tree mortality are poorly understood. The objective of this study was to determine the relative importance of stand structure, topography, soil characteristics, landscape context (the characteristics of the landscape surrounding the focal stand) and beetle pressure (the abundance of local beetle population eruptions around the focal stand a few years before the outbreak) to explain landscape patterns of tree mortality during outbreaks of three species: the mountain pine beetle, which attacks lodgepole pine and whitebark pine; the spruce beetle, which feeds on Engelmann spruce; and the Douglas-fir beetle, which attacks Douglas-fir. A second objective was to identify common variables that explain tree mortality among beetletree host pairings during outbreaks. Location Greater Yellowstone ecosystem, Wyoming, USA. Methods We used field surveys to quantify stand structure, soil characteristics and topography at the plot level in susceptible stands of each forest type showing different severities of infestation (0-98% mortality; n = 129 plots). We then used forest cover and beetle infestation maps derived from remote sensing to develop landscape context and beetle pressure metrics at different spatial scales. Plot-level and landscape-level variables were used to explain outbreak severity. Results Engelmann spruce and Douglas-fir mortality were best predicted using landscape-level variables alone. Lodgepole pine mortality was best predicted by both landscape-level and plot-level variables. Whitebark pine mortality was best although poorly - predicted by plot-level variables. Models including landscape context and beetle pressure were much better at predicting outbreak severity than models that only included plot-level measures, except for whitebark pine. Main conclusions Landscape-level variables, particularly beetle pressure, were the most consistent predictors of subsequent outbreak severity within susceptible stands of all four host species. These results may help forest managers identify vulnerable locations during ongoing outbreaks."
grace storage-runoff hystereses reveal the dynamics of regional watersheds,"We characterize how regional watersheds function as simple, dynamic systems through a series of hysteresis loops using measurements from NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites. These loops illustrate the temporal relationship between runoff and terrestrial water storage in three regional-scale watersheds (> 150 000 km(2)) of the Columbia River Basin, USA and Canada. The shape and size of the hysteresis loops are controlled by the climate, topography, and geology of the watershed. The direction of the hystereses for the GRACE signals moves in opposite directions from the isolated groundwater hystereses. The subsurface water (soil moisture and groundwater) hystereses more closely resemble the storage-runoff relationship of a soil matrix. While the physical processes underlying these hystereses are inherently complex, the vertical integration of terrestrial water in the GRACE signal encapsulates the processes that govern the non-linear function of regional-scale watersheds. We use this process-based understanding to test how GRACE data can be applied prognostically to predict seasonal runoff (mean Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency of 0.91) and monthly runoff during the low flow/high demand month of August (mean Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency of 0.77) in all three watersheds. The global nature of GRACE data allows this same methodology to be applied in other regional-scale studies, and could be particularly useful in regions with minimal data and in trans-boundary watersheds."
"simulating the effects of climate change on population connectivity of american marten (martes americana) in the northern rocky mountains, usa","We utilize empirically derived estimates of landscape resistance to assess current landscape connectivity of American marten (Martes americana) in the northern Rocky Mountains, USA, and project how a warming climate may affect landscape resistance and population connectivity in the future. We evaluate the influences of five potential future temperature scenarios involving different degrees of warming. We use resistant kernel dispersal models to assess population connectivity based on full occupancy of suitable habitat in each of these hypothetical future resistance layers. We use the CDPOP model to simulate gene exchange among individual martens in each of these hypothetical future climates. We evaluate: (1) changes in the extent, connectivity and pattern of marten habitat, (2) changes in allelic richness and expected heterozygosity, and (3) changes in the range of significant positive genetic correlation within the northern Idaho marten population under each future scenario. We found that even moderate warming scenarios resulted in very large reductions in population connectivity. Calculation of genetic correlograms for each scenario indicates that climate driven changes in landscape connectivity results in decreasing range of genetic correlation, indicating more isolated and smaller genetic neighborhoods. These, in turn, resulted in substantial loss of allelic richness and reductions in expected heterozygosity. In the U. S. northern Rocky Mountains, climate change may extensively fragment marten populations to a degree that strongly reduces genetic diversity. Our results demonstrate that for species, such as the American marten, whose population connectivity is highly tied to climatic gradients, expected climate change can result in profound changes in the extent, pattern, connectivity and gene flow of populations."
"root architecture of riparian trees: river cut-banks provide natural hydraulic excavation, revealing that cottonwoods are facultative phreatophytes","Plant root architecture reveals the sources of water and nutrients but tree root systems are large and difficult to analyze. With riparian (floodplain) trees, river cut-banks provide natural hydraulic excavation of root systems and this presents a unique study opportunity. Subsequently, we developed the 'Cut-bank Root Method', a simple, quantitative approach for analyzing the distribution of coarse roots, based on analyses of photographs of river cut-banks. These reveal the vertical extent of roots and median root depths (R-d). We applied this method along six rivers draining the Canadian Rocky Mountains and observed tenfold difference in R-d. The floodplain forests were dominated by cottonwoods and from mountain to prairie zones we observed progressively deeper roots of Populus trichocarpa (black cottonwood, R-d similar to 0.3 m), P. balsamifera (balsam poplar), P. angustifolia (narrowleaf cottonwood), and P. deltoides (prairie cottonwood, R-d similar to 0.9 m), which had Rd similar to P. fremontii (Fremont cottonwood) in Nevada, USA. Roots were shallower for co-occurring facultative riparian trees, with R-d similar to 0.1 m for P. tremuloides (trembling aspen) and Picea glauca (white spruce). Across the Canadian sites, Rd for cottonwoods were strongly associated with a growth season moisture index (May through September precipitation-potential evapotranspiration; R-2 = 0.97, P < 0.001). Thus, in wetter climates, riparian cottonwoods were shallow-rooted and would be more dependent upon rain than stream flow. Conversely, in the drier semi-arid regions the cottonwoods were phreatophytic, with deeper root systems in the capillary fringe above the alluvial ground-water table. These phreatophytic cottonwoods would be highly dependent upon stream flow and vulnerable to declining river flows due to river regulation or climate change."
seasonal versus transient snow and the elevation dependence of climate sensitivity in maritime mountainous regions,"In maritime mountainous regions, the phase of winter precipitation is elevation dependent, and in watersheds receiving both rain and snow, hydrologic impacts of climate change are less straightforward than in snowmelt-dominated systems. Here, 29 Pacific Northwest watersheds illustrate how distribution of seasonal snow, transient snow, and winter rain mediates sensitivity to 20th century warming. Watersheds with >50% of their area in the seasonal snow zone had significant (alpha <= 0.1) trends towards greater winter and lower summer discharge, while lower elevations had no consistent trends. In seasonal snow-dominated watersheds, runoff occurs 22-27 days earlier and minimum flows are 5-9% lower than in 1962, based on Sen's slope over the period. Trends in peak streamflow depend on whether watershed area susceptible to rain-on-snow events is increasing or decreasing. Delineation of elevation-dependent snow zones identifies climate sensitivity of maritime mountainous watersheds and enables planning for water and ecosystem impacts of climate change.

"investigating the influence of climate, site, location, and treatment factors on damage to young lodgepole pine in southern british columbia","Lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud. var. latifolia Engelm.) has been extensively planted throughout interior British Columbia, and as a result may be particularly susceptible to climate-induced changes in the range and severity of common damaging agents. We quantified the presence of 14 damaging agents in sixty-six 15-to 30-year-old pine stands. Hard pine stem rusts, primarily western gall rust, were present on every site. We used logistic regression to predict individual agent presence from climatic, location, site, and treatment factors and calculated odds ratios to evaluate whether risk to lodgepole pine increases or decreases as these factors change. Risk of damage from serious agents (stem disease, root disease, and mountain pine beetle) increased with increasing latitude; however, in several of these models, risk also increased as temperature of the coldest month got warmer. We also found evidence that increasing risk of damage from agents that are currently less serious (sequoia pitch moth, pine needle cast, and pine terminal weevil) was associated with warming and (or) increasingly dry climatic conditions. Given the predominance of lodgepole pine in northerly ecosystems and the prediction that climate change effects will increase with latitude, our results suggest the need to consider potential increases in damage from diseases and insects during silviculture planning and timber supply prediction."
isolation and introgression in the intermountain west: contrasting gene genealogies reveal the complex biogeographic history of the american pika (ochotona princeps),"Aim We studied the history of colonization, diversification and introgression among major phylogroups in the American pika, Ochotona princeps (Lagomorpha), using comparative and statistical phylogeographic methods. Our goal was to understand how Pleistocene climatic fluctuations have shaped the distribution of diversity at mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and nuclear DNA (nDNA) loci in this alpine specialist. Location North America's Intermountain West. Methods We accumulated mtDNA sequence data (c. 560-1700 bp) from 232 pikas representing 64 localities, and sequenced two nuclear introns (mast cell growth factor, c. 550 bp, n = 148; protein kinase C iota, c. 660 bp, n = 139) from a subset of individuals. To determine the distribution of major mtDNA lineages, we conducted a phylogenetic analysis on the mtDNA sequence data, and we calculated divergence times among the lineages using a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo approach. Relationships among nuclear alleles were explored with minimum spanning networks. Finally, we conducted coalescent simulations of alternative models of population history to test for congruence between nDNA and mtDNA responses to Pleistocene glacial cycles. Results We found that: (1) all individuals could be assigned to one of five allopatric mtDNA lineages; (2) lineages are associated with separate mountain provinces; (3) lineages originated from at least two rounds of differentiation; (4) nDNA and mtDNA markers exhibited overall phylogeographic congruence; and (5) introgression among phylogroups has occurred at nuclear loci since their initial isolation. Main conclusions Pika populations associated with different mountain systems have followed separate but not completely independent evolutionary trajectories through multiple glacial cycles. Range expansion associated with climate cooling (i.e. glaciations) promoted genetic admixture among populations within mountain ranges. It also permitted periodic contact and introgression between phylogroups associated with different mountain systems, the record of which is retained at nDNA but not mtDNA loci. Evidence for different histories at nuclear and mtDNA loci (i.e. periodic introgression versus deep isolation, respectively) emphasizes the importance of multilocus perspectives for reconstructing complete population histories."
spatial variations of effective moisture in the western united states,"Spatial patterns of actual evapotranspiration (AE), potential evapotranspiration (PE), and their ratio (AE/PE) in the western United States are examined to describe the annual cycle of moisture availability. Long-term (1971-2000) averages of observed temperature and precipitation, and sunshine data were used to calculate AE and PE. A cluster analysis identifies regions with similar annual cycles of AE/PE. We identify three different spatial scales of variability in AE/PE: (1) broadscale patterns reflect the trade-off between winter-dominated precipitation of the Pacific Northwest and summer-dominated precipitation east of the Rocky Mountains, and the south-to-north decrease in PE related to latitudinal variations in net radiation; (2) mesoscale patterns show the influence of regional-scale features (e. g., the North American Monsoon); and (3) local-scale patterns are related to topography. Understanding the scales of effective-moisture variations is valuable from the perspective of terrestrial ecosystems and water resources management in the mostly arid western United States. Citation: Shinker, J.J., and P.J. Bartlein (2010), Spatial variations of effective moisture in the western United States, Geophys. Res. Lett., 37, L02701, doi:10.1029/2009GL041387."
evaluating the temperature sensitivity of radial growth patterns from whitebark pine in the western canadian cordillera,"We present a network of thirteen annual ring-width chronologies from high elevation whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis Engelm.) sites in the western Canadian Cordillera in order to assess the dendroclimatic potential of this long-lived tree species. The temperature signal within the chronologies is complex and strongly influenced by diverging trends in the summer temperature and ring-width records from across the region. A first differences transformation of the tree-ring and temperature records illustrates a loss of frequency coherence in growth response to summer temperatures following reduced radial growth in the 1950s. Prior to reduced growth, we note a positive association with summer temperatures for both first differenced (r(d) = 0.60) and traditional (r = 0.50) records. Following reduced growth, the association at first differences is maintained (r(d) = 0.49) whereas there is a change in the lower frequency component of tree growth response to summer temperatures (r = -0.34). We suggest the cause of this reduced temperature sensitivity is related to the interaction between diurnal temperature and cloud cover patterns, the hydrological regime of snowpack, and site conditions which have been amenable to the initiation of moisture stress during the latter half of the 20th century. Reduced radial growth is coincident with the arrival of white pine blister rust (Cronatium ribicola J.C. Fisch. ex Raben) into the study region which suggests this infestation may be related to the observed reduction in radial growth. Whitebark pine has considerable potential for the field of dendroclimatology. Unfortunately, the decline of the species due to the combined effects of climate change, white pine blister rust, mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopk.), and forest fire exclusion practices indicate this potential may remain unfulfilled.

"climate change, water rights, and water supply: the case of irrigated agriculture in idaho","We conduct a hedonic analysis to estimate the response of agricultural land use to water supply information under the Prior Appropriation Doctrine by using Idaho as a case study. Our analysis includes long-term climate (weather) trends and water supply conditions as well as seasonal water supply forecasts. A farm-level panel data set, which accounts for the priority effects of water rights and controls for diversified crop mixes and rotation practices, is used. Our results indicate that farmers respond to the long-term surface and ground water conditions as well as to the seasonal water supply variations. Climate change-induced variations in climate and water supply conditions could lead to substantial damages to irrigated agriculture. We project substantial losses (up to 32%) of the average crop revenue for major agricultural areas under future climate scenarios in Idaho. Finally, farmers demonstrate significantly varied responses given their water rights priorities, which imply that the distributional impact of climate change is sensitive to institutions such as the Prior Appropriation Doctrine."
climate-streamflow linkages in the north-central rocky mountains: implications for a changing climate,"Water, already a scarce resource in the semiarid Western United States, has become increasingly threatened due to population growth pressures, natural climate variability, and the prospect of future climate change. Water managers are challenged by uncertainties concerning how climate variability and change interact with water supply at the regional level. This study aims to increase predictive capacity in one of the largest river systems in the Western United States, the Snake River, by identifying key atmosphere-ocean controls on streamflow and assessing how projected climate changes will translate into future water supply in the river. In contrast to previous research suggesting the Snake headwaters are in an area of weak teleconnection influence, the results of this study indicate that the region exhibits a response to El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) that is similar to the Pacific Northwest and strongly modulated by northern Pacific conditions. Although current projections of how dynamic features like ENSO might respond to climate change are highly uncertain, the lagged nature of the relationship between Pacific Ocean conditions and streamflow will be useful for near-term planning. The region was found to be sensitive to shifts in the winter westerly storm track system, with extreme low-flow years associated with a north-shifted storm track. Precipitation increases have been projected for the region, but other predicted consequences of climate change-including a poleward shift in storm track position, changing seasonality, and reduced snowpack-suggest an increased likelihood of future drought conditions."
the effects of topography on forest soil characteristics in the oregon cascade mountains (usa): implications for the effects of climate change on soil properties,"Forest soil measurements were made at over 180 sites distributed throughout the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest (HJA) in the Oregon Cascade Mountains. The influences of both elevation and aspect on soil variables were measured in the early (1998) and late summer (1994). Increased elevation significantly increased soil moisture, mean annual precipitation, soil organic matter, labile C and mineralizable N, microbial activities, extractable ammonium, and denitrification potentials. In contrast, bulk density, pH and soil temperature (1998 only) were significantly lower at the higher elevations. Relative to labile C, mineralizable N was preferentially sequestered at higher elevations. Aspect significantly affected annual mean temperature and precipitation, soil moisture and temperature, soil organic matter, mineralizable N, extractable ammonium, denitrification, and microbial activities. There were no significant higher statistical interactions between elevation and aspect on climatic or soil factors. Soil organic matter (SOM) accumulation at higher elevations is likely driven by a reduction in decomposition rates rather that an increase in primary productivity, however, SOM accumulation on north facing slopes is probably due to both a decrease in decomposition and an increase in primary production. Models of climate change effects on temperate forest soils based on elevational studies may not apply to aspect gradients since plant productivity may not respond to temperature-moisture gradients in the same way across all topographical features.

attribution of declining western us. snowpack to human effects,"Observations show snowpack has declined across much of the western United States over the period 1950-99. This reduction has important social and economic implications, as water retained in the snowpack from winter storms forms an important part of the hydrological cycle and water supply in the region. A formal model-based detection and attribution (D-A) study of these reductions is performed. The detection variable is the ratio of 1 April snow water equivalent (SWE) to water-year-to-date precipitation (P), chosen to reduce the effect of P variability on the results. Estimates of natural internal climate variability are obtained from 1600 years of two control simulations performed with fully coupled ocean-atmosphere climate models. Estimates of the SWE/P response to anthropogenic greenhouse gases, ozone, and some aerosols are taken from multiple-member ensembles of perturbation experiments run with two models. The D-A shows the observations and anthropogenically forced models have greater SWE/P reductions than can be explained by natural internal climate variability alone. Model-estimated effects of changes in solar and volcanic forcing likewise do not explain the SWE/P reductions. The mean model estimate is that about half of the SWE/P reductions observed in the west from 1950 to 1999 are the result of climate changes forced by anthropogenic greenhouse gases, ozone, and aerosols."
phylogeography of iris missouriensis (iridaceae) based on nuclear and chloroplast markers,"We investigated the phylogeography of Iris missouriensis (Iridaceae), which is widely distributed in western North America. We utilized transposon display and DNA sequencing to quantify nuclear and chloroplast genetic structure. Our objectives were (i) to characterize the geographic structure of genetic variation throughout the species range, (ii) to test whether both margins of the range show reduced genetic diversity as predicted by north-south expansion and contraction associated with climate change, and (iii) to determine whether the subspecies Iris missouriensis ssp. longipetala is genetically distinct. We found that genetic diversity was significantly lower in the northern part of the range but was not significantly different between the central and southern regions, indicating greater stability of the southern margin vs. the northern. Among-population differentiation was high (Phi(PT) = 0.52). The largest divisions in each marker set were concordant and separated the southern Rocky Mountains and Basin and Range provinces from the remainder of the range. The boundaries of this phylogeographic break do not coincide with gaps in present-day distributions or phylogeographic breaks identified in other species, and may indicate a measure of reproductive isolation. Consistent with current treatments, we did not find support for the taxonomic placement of I. missourienis ssp. longipetala as a distinct species. Although transposon display has been used to investigate relationships among crop accessions and their wild relatives, to our knowledge, this is the first use of these markers for population-level phylogeography of a nonmodel species and further demonstrates their utility in species recalcitrant to amplified fragment length polymorphism protocols."
invasive pathogens at alpine treeline: consequences for treeline dynamics,"The potential impact of invasive forest pathogens oil alpine treeline dynamics has not previously been considered. Whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis), a foundation and keystone species of subalpine forests and major component of alpine treeline in the northern Rocky Mountains of the United States and southern Canada, is infected nearly range-wide by the exotic pathogen Cronartium ribicola, which causes white pine blister rust. A major component of treeline in the northern Rocky Mountains, whitebark pine initiates tree islands on the eastern slope in northwestern Montana more than any other conifer species. Blister rust infects whitebark pine throughout the region, and both infection and mortality are already evident at treeline. We discuss the cascading ecological effects of the loss of treeline whitebark pine and expected changes in landscape vegetation patterns. Potential implications of the loss of whitebark pine for northwestern Montana treelines are examined in the context of climate change within a conceptual model. We speculate that exotic pathogens could potentially confound predictions of treeline responses to global warming in many geographic regions."
a projection of the effects of the climate change induced by increased co2 on extreme hydrologic events in the western us,"The effects of increased atmospheric CO2 on the frequency of extreme hydrologic events in the Western United States (WUS) for the 10-yr period of 2040-2049 are examined using dynamically downscaled regional climate change signals. For assessing the changes in the occurrence of hydrologic extremes, downscaled climate change signals in daily precipitation and runoff that are likely to indicate the occurrence of extreme events are examined. Downscaled climate change signals in the selected indicators suggest that the global warming induced by increased CO2 is likely to increase extreme hydrologic events in the WUS. The indicators for heavy precipitation events show largest increases in the mountainous regions of the northern California Coastal Range and the Sierra Nevada. Increased cold season precipitation and increased rainfall-portion of precipitation at the expense of snowfall in the projected warmer climate result in large increases in high runoff events in the Sierra Nevada river basins that are already prone to cold season flooding in today's climate. The projected changes in the hydrologic characteristics in the WUS are mainly associated with higher freezing levels in the warmer climate and increases in the cold season water vapor influx from the Pacific Ocean."
"hydrologic regimes of forested, mountainous, headwater basins in new hampshire, north carolina, oregon, and puerto rico","This study characterized the hydrologic regimes at four forested, mountainous long-term ecological research (LTER) sites: H.J. Andrews (Oregon), Coweeta (North Carolina), Hubbard Brook (New Hampshire), and Luquillo (Puerto Rico). Over 600 basinyears of daily streamflow records were examined from 18 basins that have not experienced human disturbances since at least the 1930s and in some cases much longer periods. This study used statistical methods to systematically evaluate the relationship between precipitation and streamflow at a range of spatial and temporal scales, and draw inferences from these relationships about the hydrologic behavior of the basins. Basins in this study had fundamentally different abilities to store and release moisture at a range of time and space scales. These different hydrologic regimes are the result of different types of forest canopies, snow, and soils in the study basins. Through their influences on interception and transpiration, forest canopies appear to play a very important role in the hydrologic regimes at Andrews and Luquillo, but at Coweeta and Hubbard Brook, the current deciduous forest plays a more limited although seasonally important role. Because of the timing of melt and its interaction with soils, seasonal snowpacks at Hubbard Brook and Andrews have quite different effects upon streamflow and vegetation water use. A variety of water flowpath types in soil, from macropore flow to long flowpaths in deep soils or fractured bedrock, appear to operate at the four sites. Hydrologic regimes may help predict the temporal scales of biogeochemical cycling and stream ecological processes, as well as the magnitude and timing of hydrologic response to disturbance and climate change in headwater basins.

"twentieth-century fire patterns in the selway-bitterroot wilderness area, idaho/montana, and the gila/aldo leopold wilderness complex, new mexico","Twentieth century fire patterns were analyzed for two large, disparate wilderness areas in the Rocky Mountains. Spatial and temporal patterns of fires were represented as GIS-based digital fire atlases compiled from archival Forest Service data. We find that spatial and temporal fire patterns are related to landscape features and changes in land use. The rate and extent of burning are interpreted in the context of changing fire management strategies in each wilderness area. This research provides contextual information to guide fire management in these land similar) areas in the future and forms the basis for future research involving the empirical definition of fire regimes based on spatially explicit time-series of fire occurrence."
radiative forcing of natural forest disturbances,"Forest disturbances are major sources of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, and therefore impact global climate. Biogeophysical attributes, such as surface albedo (reflectivity), further control the climate-regulating properties of forests. Using both tower-based and remotely sensed data sets, we show that natural disturbances from wildfire, beetle outbreaks, and hurricane wind throw can significantly alter surface albedo, and the associated radiative forcing either offsets or enhances the CO<sub xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">2</sub> forcing caused by reducing ecosystem carbon sequestration over multiple years. In the examined cases, the radiative forcing from albedo change is on the same order of magnitude as the CO<sub xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">2</sub> forcing. The net radiative forcing resulting from these two factors leads to a local heating effect in a hurricane-damaged mangrove forest in the subtropics, and a cooling effect following wildfire and mountain pine beetle attack in boreal forests with winter snow. Although natural forest disturbances currently represent less than half of gross forest cover loss, that area will probably increase in the future under climate change, making it imperative to represent these processes accurately in global climate models."
water resources implications of global warming: a us regional perspective,"The implications of global warming for the performance of six U.S. water resource systems are evaluated. The six case study sites represent a range of geographic and hydrologic, as well as institutional and social settings. Large, multi-reservoir systems (Columbia River, Missouri River, Apalachicola-Chatahoochee-Flint (ACF) Rivers), small, one or two reservoir systems (Tacoma and Boston) and medium size systems (Savannah River) are represented. The river basins range from mountainous to low relief and semi-humid to semi-arid, and the system operational purposes range from predominantly municipal to broadly multi-purpose. The studies inferred, using a chain of climate downscaling, hydrologic and water resources systems models, the sensitivity of six water resources systems to changes in precipitation, temperature and solar radiation. The climate change scenarios used in this study are based on results from transient climate change experiments performed with coupled ocean-atmosphere General Circulation Models (GCMs) for the 1995 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment. An earlier doubled-CO2 scenario from one of the GCMs was also used in the evaluation. The GCM scenarios were transferred to the local level using a simple downscaling approach that scales local weather variables by fixed monthly ratios (for precipitation) and fixed monthly shifts (for temperature). For those river basins where snow plays an important role in the current climate hydrology (Tacoma, Columbia, Missouri and, to a lesser extent, Boston) changes in temperature result in important changes in seasonal streamflow hydrographs. In these systems, spring snowmelt peaks are reduced and winter flows increase, on average. Changes in precipitation are generally reflected in the annual total runoff volumes more than in the seasonal shape of the hydrographs. In the Savannah and ACF systems, where snow plays a minor hydrological role, changes in hydrological response are linked more directly to temperature and precipitation changes. Effects on system performance varied from system to system, from GCM to GCM, and for each system operating objective (such as hydropower production, municipal and industrial supply, flood control, recreation, navigation and instream flow protection). Effects were generally smaller for the transient scenarios than for the doubled CO2 scenario. In terms of streamflow, one of the transient scenarios tended to have increases at most sites, while another tended to have decreases at most sites. The third showed no general consistency over the six sites. Generally, the water resource system performance effects were determined by the hydrologic changes and the amount of buffering provided by the system's storage capacity. The effects of demand growth and other plausible future operational considerations were evaluated as well. For most sites, the effects of these non-climatic effects on future system performance would about equal or exceed the effects of climate change over system planning horizons."
effects of climate on radial growth of sub-alpine conifers in the north cascade mountains,"Dendroecological techniques were used to study the influence of climate on the growth of subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa (Hook.) Nutt.), Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii Parry), and subalpine larch (Larix lyallii Parl.) in the North Cascade Mountains of Washington state. Study sites were selected on different topographic features at three points along an elevation gradient (ridgetop, valley slope, and valley floor) to characterize site influences on growth response to climate. Mixed species stands were sampled to identify possible differences in species response to climate on a common site. Species differences account for most of the variability in radial growth patterns and response to climate. The greatest differences are between subalpine fir and subalpine larch, while the greatest similarities are between subalpine fir and Engelmann spruce. After species, aspect is the most significant factor affecting growth response to climate. Spring snowpack and summer temperature are the primary climatic factors influencing growth. Spring snowpack is negatively correlated with growth for all three species, but the relationship is strongest for subalpine fir and weakest for subalpine larch. Subalpine larch growth is positively correlated with June temperature. Subalpine fir growth is positively correlated with July-August temperature. Engelmann spruce growth is positively correlated with June-August temperature, but unusually warm July-August temperatures are associated with reduced growth the following year. The response of subalpine forests in the North Cascades to future climate change will depend on winter snowpack accumulations and spring snowmelt rates. Earlier meltouts and warmer summers would benefit growth on north aspect sites, but could also increase the frequency and severity of summer drought conditions on ridges and south-aspect sites, where summer soil moisture may already be limiting."
landscape-level analysis of mountain goat population connectivity in washington and southern british columbia,"Habitat fragmentation and habitat loss diminish population connectivity, reducing genetic diversity and increasing extinction risk over time. Improving connectivity is widely recommended to preserve the long-term viability of populations, but this requires accurate knowledge of how landscapes influence connectivity. Detectability of landscape effects on gene flow is highly dependent on landscape context, and drawing conclusions from single landscape studies may lead to ineffective management strategies. We present a novel approach to elucidate regional variation in the relative importance of landscape variable effects on gene flow. We demonstrate this approach by evaluating gene flow between isolated, genetically impoverished mountain goat (Oreamnos americanus) populations in Washington and much larger, genetically robust populations in southern British Columbia. We used geneland to identify steep genetic gradients and then employed individual-based landscape genetics in a causal modeling framework to independently evaluate landscape variables that may be generating each of these genetic gradients. Our results support previous findings that freeways, highways, water, agriculture and urban landcover limit gene flow in this species. Additionally, we found that a previously unsupported landscape variable, distance to escape terrain, also limits gene flow in some contexts. By integrating geneland and individual-based methods we effectively identified regional limiting factors that have landscape-level implications for population viability."
a coupled hierarchical modeling approach to simulating the geomorphic response of river systems to anthropogenic climate change,"Anthropogenic climate change is expected to change the discharge and sediment transport regime of river systems. Because rivers adjust their channels to accommodate their typical inputs of water and sediment, changes in these variables can potentially alter river morphology. In this study, a hierarchical modeling approach was developed and applied to examine potential changes in reach-averaged bedload transport and spatial patterns of erosion and deposition for three snowmelt-dominated gravelbed rivers in the interior Pacific Northwest. The modeling hierarchy was based on discharge and suspended-sediment load from a basin-scale hydrologic model driven by a range of downscaled climate-change scenarios. In the field, channel morphology and sediment grain-size data for all three rivers were collected. Changes in reach-averaged bedload transport were estimated using the Bedload Assessment of Gravel-bedded Streams (BAGS) software, and the Cellular Automaton Evolutionary Slope and River (CAESAR) model was used to simulate the spatial pattern of erosion and deposition within each reach to infer potential changes in channel geometry and planform. The duration of critical discharge was found to control bedload transport. Changes in channel geometry were simulated for the two higher-energy river reaches, but no significant morphological changes were found for a lower-energy reach with steep, cohesive banks. Changes in sediment transport and river morphology resulting from climate change could affect the management of river systems for human and ecological uses.

local variability mediates vulnerability of trout populations to land use and climate change,"Land use and climate change occur simultaneously around the globe. Fully understanding their separate and combined effects requires a mechanistic understanding at the local scale where their effects are ultimately realized. Here we applied an individual-based model of fish population dynamics to evaluate the role of local stream variability in modifying responses of Coastal Cutthroat Trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii clarkii) to scenarios simulating identical changes in temperature and stream flows linked to forest harvest, climate change, and their combined effects over six decades. We parameterized the model for four neighboring streams located in a forested headwater catchment in northwestern Oregon, USA with multi-year, daily measurements of stream temperature, flow, and turbidity (20072011), and field measurements of both instream habitat structure and three years of annual trout population estimates. Model simulations revealed that variability in habitat conditions among streams (depth, available habitat) mediated the effects of forest harvest and climate change. Net effects for most simulated trout responses were different from or less than the sum of their separate scenarios. In some cases, forest harvest countered the effects of climate change through increased summer flow. Climate change most strongly influenced trout (earlier fry emergence, reductions in biomass of older trout, increased biomass of young-of-year), but these changes did not consistently translate into reductions in biomass over time. Forest harvest, in contrast, produced fewer and less consistent responses in trout. Earlier fry emergence driven by climate change was the most consistent simulated response, whereas survival, growth, and biomass were inconsistent. Overall our findings indicate a host of local processes can strongly influence how populations respond to broad scale effects of land use and climate change."
"summer stream temperatures influence sculpin distributions and spatial partitioning in the upper clark fork river basin, montana","The upper Clark Fork River basin of western Montana supports a poorly understood sculpin (Uranidea spp.) fauna that has perplexed ichthyologists and fish ecologists since the late 1800s. During our study, the basin contained three sculpin taxa whose taxonomy was under revision. All three taxa were formerly referred to the genus Cottus but are now treated as Uranidea. Our goal was to improve understanding of the distribution and ecology of two of the taxa. From 2006 to 2009, we sampled 144 reaches in 31 streams and rivers to determine distributions of each taxa across the study area and within streams. We collected habitat data in 2007 and stream temperature data from 2006-2009 to identify correlates of sculpin distributions. In streams where both taxa occurred, Rocky Mountain Sculpin Uranidea sp. cf. bairdii were downstream and Columbia Slimy Sculpin U. sp. cf. cognata were upstream with a syntopic zone in between. Summer stream temperatures strongly influenced sculpin distributions, with mean August 2007 water temperatures increasing in order of reaches characterized as: Columbia Slimy Sculpin-dominated, syntopic, Rocky Mountain Sculpin-dominated, and no sculpin. Columbia Slimy Sculpin occurred in cold tributaries a the Blackfoot, Clark Fork, and Bitterroot rivers and in two coldwater refugia in the mainstem Bitterroot River. In contrast, Rocky Mountain Sculpin occupied warmer downstream segments of many Blackfoot and Clark Fork river tributaries as well as some mainstem reaches of both rivers but were absent from the Bitterroot River drainage. Persistence of the taxa will likely depend, both directly and indirectly, on future water temperatures, and thus, sculpins are appropriate targets for researching and monitoring biological changes resulting from climate change."
genetic diversity is related to climatic variation and vulnerability in threatened bull trout,"Understanding how climatic variation influences ecological and evolutionary processes is crucial for informed conservation decision-making. Nevertheless, few studies have measured how climatic variation influences genetic diversity within populations or how genetic diversity is distributed across space relative to future climatic stress. Here, we tested whether patterns of genetic diversity (allelic richness) were related to climatic variation and habitat features in 130 bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus) populations from 24 watersheds (i.e., similar to 4-7th order river subbasins) across the Columbia River Basin, USA. We then determined whether bull trout genetic diversity was related to climate vulnerability at the watershed scale, which we quantified on the basis of exposure to future climatic conditions (projected scenarios for the 2040s) and existing habitat complexity. We found a strong gradient in genetic diversity in bull trout populations across the Columbia River Basin, where populations located in the most upstream headwater areas had the greatest genetic diversity. After accounting for spatial patterns with linear mixed models, allelic richness in bull trout populations was positively related to habitat patch size and complexity, and negatively related to maximum summer temperature and the frequency of winter flooding. These relationships strongly suggest that climatic variation influences evolutionary processes in this threatened species and that genetic diversity will likely decrease due to future climate change. Vulnerability at a watershed scale was negatively correlated with average genetic diversity (r=-0.77; P<0.001); watersheds containing populations with lower average genetic diversity generally had the lowest habitat complexity, warmest stream temperatures, and greatest frequency of winter flooding. Together, these findings have important conservation implications for bull trout and other imperiled species. Genetic diversity is already depressed where climatic vulnerability is highest; it will likely erode further in the very places where diversity may be most needed for future persistence."
geographically variable response of dendroctonus ponderosae to winter warming in the western united states,"Milder winters have contributed to recent outbreaks of Dendroctonus ponderosae in Canada, but have not been evaluated as a factor permitting concurrent outbreaks across its large range (ca.1500 x 1500 km) in the western United States (US). We examined the trend in minimum air temperatures in D. ponderosae habitats across the western US and assessed whether warming winters explained the occurrence of outbreaks using physiological and population models. We used climate data to analyze the history of minimum air temperatures and reconstruct physiological effects of cold on D. ponderosae. We evaluated relations between winter temperatures and beetle abundance using aerial detection survey data. Extreme winter temperatures have warmed by about 4 A degrees C since 1960 across the western US. At the broadest scale, D. ponderosae population dynamics between 1997 and 2010 were unrelated to variation in minimum temperatures, but relations between cold and D. ponderosae dynamics varied among regions. In the 11 coldest ecoregions, lethal winter temperatures have become less frequent since the 1980s and beetle-caused tree mortality increased-consistent with the climatic release hypothesis. However, in the 12 warmer regions, recent epidemics cannot be attributed to warming winters because earlier winters were not cold enough to kill D. ponderosae. There has been pronounced warming of winter temperatures throughout the western US, and this has reduced previous constraints on D. ponderosae abundance in some regions. However, other considerations are necessary to understand the broad extent of recent D. ponderosae epidemics in the western US."
projected deglaciation of western canada in the twenty-first century,"Retreat of mountain glaciers is a significant contributor to sea-level rise and a potential threat to human populations through impacts on water availability and regional hydrology. Like most of Earth's mountain glaciers, those in western North America are experiencing rapid mass loss(1,2). Projections of future large-scale mass change are based on surface mass balance models that are open to criticism, because they ignore or greatly simplify glacier physics. Here we use a high-resolution regional glaciation model, developed by coupling physics-based ice dynamics with a surface mass balance model, to project the fate of glaciers in western Canada. We use twenty-first-century climate scenarios from an ensemble of global climate models in our simulations; the results indicate that by 2100, the volume of glacier ice in western Canada will shrink by 70 +/- 10% relative to 2005. According to our simulations, few glaciers will remain in the Interior and Rockies regions, but maritime glaciers, in particular those in northwestern British Columbia, will survive in a diminished state. We project the maximum rate of ice volume loss, corresponding to peak input of deglacial meltwater to streams and rivers, to occur around 2020-2040. Potential implications include impacts on aquatic ecosystems, agriculture, forestry, alpine tourism and water quality."
disruption of the 'disease triangle' by chemical and physical environmental change,"The physical and chemical environment of the Earth has changed rapidly over the last 100 years and is predicted to continue to change into the foreseeable future. One of the main concerns with potential alterations in climate is the propensity for increases in the magnitude and frequency of extremes to occur. Even though precipitation is predicted to increase in some locations, in others precipitation is expected to decrease and evapotranspiration increase with air temperature, resulting in exacerbated drought in the future. Chemical [ozone (O-3) and other air contaminants] and subsequent physical alterations in the environment will have a profound effect on the 'disease triangle' (a favourable environment, a susceptible host and a virulent pathogen) and should be included in any analysis of biological response to climate change. The chemical and physical environment affects plant health and alters plant susceptibility to insect and pathogen attack through increased frequency, duration and severity of drought and reduction in host vigour. The potential effects of climate change and O3 on tree diseases with emphasis on the western United States are discussed. We describe a generalised modelling approach to incorporate the complexities of the 'disease triangle' into dynamic vegetation models."
"a spatiotemporal pattern analysis of potential mountain pine beetle emergence in british columbia, canada","Emergence, the beginning of the mountain pine beetle life cycle and initiation of dispersal leading to colonization of new hosts, is a key beetle population process but it is also probably the least understood. Although from the management perspective information on beetle emergence is crucial in determining an appropriate timing to monitor beetle populations and mitigate outbreaks, especially at the landscape scale in a changing climate, no attempt has yet been made to map the spatiotemporal patterns of beetle emergence across the landscape. In this study, we used a novel heating cycle approach to map potential beetle emergence spatially and temporally. This study reveals that the thermal environment and timing for potential beetle emergence are spatially and temporally synchronous across the landscape. The spatial synchrony in potential beetle emergence occurs at a distance of more than 1500 km across the BC landscape. The spatiotemporal patterns of potential beetle emergence vary with the defined factors (region, period, latitude, elevation, and landform type). At the provincial and regional levels, the thermal environment for potential beetle emergence is surprisingly warmer during 1977-1987 compared to 1999-2010 except for the Southeast region although the provincial climate and weather are generally warmer during 1999-2010 than during 1977-1987, suggesting a small increase in annual temperature may not be enough to significantly improve the thermal environment. A warmer thermal environment with a larger temporal window for potential beetle emergence (i.e., the potential emergence starts earlier and ends later) is associated with the Southeast region, lower latitude and elevation, and landscape topographic features of canyons and valleys. However, although the thermal environment varies with the defined factors, the timing and window of potential beetle peak emergence remain consistent among these defined factors, suggesting that beetles may take different strategies to adapt to temporally synchronized thermal windows in the regions and areas with varied thermal environments. The summarized variables of heating cycles are limited in generally predicting the beetle infestations for a specific period, especially at endemic and incipient levels. However, they may play a greater role in predicting more severely infested areas. The heating cycle approach demonstrated in this study may provide a simple complementary tool to the existing climate suitability models in assessing the impacts of climate change on beetle outbreaks, particularly for those bark beetle species whose physiological responses to temperature have not been fully studied.

"cascading effects of feedbacks, disease, and climate change on alpine treeline dynamics","Whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis) is important for tree island development in some alpine treeline ecosystems in western North America: therefore the effects of an exotic disease on whitebark pine may cascade to other species and affect how treeline responds to climate change. We developed an agent-based model to examine the interactive impacts of blister rust and climate change on treeline dynamics. Our model includes positive and negative feedback effects for population processes and infection in a neighborhood. We simulated a present-day-like whitebark pine treeline community in the northern U.S. Rocky Mountains under stable conditions, and then conditions of disease, climate amelioration, and their combination. The loss of pine to disease was only partly compensated by the effect of climate change, and resulted in less facilitation for other species reversing the positive effects of climate amelioration. Spatially explicit simulation captured the cascading effects of neighborhood facilitation on treeline populations and patterns. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
phenology and density-dependent dispersal predict patterns of mountain pine beetle (dendroctonus ponderosae) impact,"For species with irruptive population behavior, dispersal is an important component of outbreak dynamics. We developed and parameterized a mechanistic model describing mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) population demographics and dispersal across a landscape. Model components include temperature-dependent phenology, host tree colonization determined by an Allee effect, and random-walk dispersal with motility conditioned by host tree density. The model was parameterized at a study site in central Idaho, United States (US), and evaluated at an independent site in northern Washington, US. Phloem and air temperatures, MPB spatial impact data from USDA Forest Service aerial detection surveys, and remotely sensed host tree density data were used to parameterize the model using a maximum likelihood approach. At both study sites the model was highly accurate (>84%) in predicting annual pattern formation when the model was re-initiated each year with the location of new patches of infested trees. Prediction of annual population growth at both sites was also good (>90%), although the model under-predicted area impacted at the Washington site, and at both sites was unable to predict initiation of new small patches. Our model extends previous research by providing a mechanistic description of the link between motility, dispersal and temperature-dependent MPB phenology. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

modeling the effects of dispersal and patch size on predicted fisher (pekania [martes] pennanti) distribution in the us rocky mountains,"Climate change impacts many species through shifts in habitat. The intensity of this impact will depend on the dispersal rates of the species, the patchiness of the environment, and the velocity of habitat change. Here we examine how dispersal affects projected future habitat availability for a threatened carnivore, the fisher (Pekania [Martes] pennanti). We used non-invasive genetic sampling to detect fisher across their historical distribution in Montana and Idaho. This survey included 4846 non-invasive hair snares, of which 288 identified fishers through mitochondrial DNA analysis. We modeled the distribution of fisher across western Montana and northern Idaho using a suite of vegetative, topographic, and climatic variables. We modeled future distribution using a global climate model and two climate change scenarios (high emissions [A2] or reduced emissions [B2]) and three time steps (2030, 2060, and 2090). We incorporated the effects of dispersal ability and habitat patch size into our model by varying the distance and enforcing a minimum patch size at which newly created habitat could be colonized. We found that the probability of current fisher occurrence was highest given the presence of mesic forest types with tall trees, high annual precipitation, and mid-range winter temperatures. Future predictions show an increase in area of high-probability habitat under most dispersal assumptions. Interestingly, we found a large contrast in results when minimum patch size and species dispersal capabilities were considered. Our distribution model with full dispersal and no limits on patch size predicted a 24.5% increase in fisher habitat by 2090, whereas a dispersal limit of 1 km through non-habitat (agricultural fields and urban zones) and a minimum patch size yielded a loss of 25.8% of fisher habitat under this same scenario. Varying dispersal appears to limit habitat availability more than minimum patch size under most scenarios. Published by Elsevier Ltd."
numerical simulation of the impact of sediment supply and streamflow variations on channel grain sizes and chinook salmon habitat in mountain drainage networks,"Climatically driven changes in streamflow and hillslope sediment supply could potentially alter stream surface grain size distribution patterns and thereby impact habitat for a number of threatened and endangered in-stream fish species. Relatively little is known about hydrograph (shape, peak flow) influence or the relative importance of chronic and episodic hillslope inputs on channel conditions. To better understand these external drivers, we calculated sediment routing through a gravel-bedded river network using a one-dimensional (1D) bedload transport model. We calculated changes in grain sizes and estimated Chinook salmon habitat suitability caused by a dry year and an extreme flood hydrograph, and chronic (diffusive, overland flow) or pulse (landslide, debris flow) hillslope sediment supplies. To obtain accurate channel conditions, a relatively high reference Shields stress, representative of steep mountain streams, was needed. An extreme event flood without any hillslope sediment inputs caused widespread bed coarsening and a decrease in aquatic habitat. Chronic sediment input combined with this hydrograph eliminated any changes in grain size and habitat, although when combined with a dry year flow, caused systematic bed fining. The influence of a given hydrograph therefore highly depends on the hillslope sediment supply. Regardless of the flow hydrograph or sediment pulse timing, grain size distribution or location, pulse sediment inputs did not cause widespread grain size changes despite being 100 times the total chronic input volume. Widespread and continuous hillslope sediment inputs may influence channel grain sizes and aquatic habitat more than a single discrete sediment pulse. Depending on the magnitudes of flow hydrograph and sediment supply alterations, climate change may induce no differences in grain sizes or very dramatic changes with significant consequences for long-term sustainability.

variability common to first leaf dates and snowpack in the western conterminous united states,"Singular value decomposition is used to identify the common variability in first leaf dates (FLDs) and 1 April snow water equivalent (SWE) for the western United States during the period 1900-2012. Results indicate two modes of joint variability that explain 57% of the variability in FLD and 69% of the variability in SWE. The first mode of joint variability is related to widespread late winter-spring warming or cooling across the entire west. The second mode can be described as a north-south dipole in temperature for FLD, as well as in cool season temperature and precipitation for SWE, that is closely correlated to the El Nino-Southern Oscillation. Additionally, both modes of variability indicate a relation with the Pacific-North American atmospheric pattern. These results indicate that there is a substantial amount of common variance in FLD and SWE that is related to large-scale modes of climate variability."
will future climate favor more erratic wildfires in the western united states?,"Wildfires that occurred over the western United States during August 2012 were fewer in number but larger in size when compared with all other Augusts in the twenty-first century. This unique characteristic, along with the tremendous property damage and potential loss of life that occur with large wildfires with erratic behavior, raised the question of whether future climate will favor rapid wildfire growth so that similar wildfire activity may become more frequent as climate changes. This study addresses this question by examining differences in the climatological distribution of the Haines index (HI) between the current and projected future climate over the western United States. The HI, ranging from 2 to 6, was designed to characterize dry, unstable air in the lower atmosphere that may contribute to erratic or extreme fire behavior. A shift in HI distribution from low values (2 and 3) to higher values (5 and 6) would indicate an increased risk for rapid wildfire growth and spread. Distributions of Haines index are calculated from simulations of current (1971-2000) and future (2041-70) climate using multiple regional climate models in the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program. Despite some differences among the projections, the simulations indicate that there may be not only more days but also more consecutive days with HI 5 during August in the future. This result suggests that future atmospheric environments will be more conducive to erratic wildfires in the mountainous regions of the western United States."
rapid increases and time-lagged declines in amphibian occupancy after wildfire,"Climate change is expected to increase the frequency and severity of drought and wildfire. Aquatic and moisture-sensitive species, such as amphibians, may be particularly vulnerable to these modified disturbance regimes because large wildfires often occur during extended droughts and thus may compound environmental threats. However, understanding of the effects of wildfires on amphibians in forests with long fire-return intervals is limited. Numerous stand-replacing wildfires have occurred since 1988 in Glacier National Park (Montana, U.S.A.), where we have conducted long-term monitoring of amphibians. We measured responses of 3 amphibian species to fires of different sizes, severity, and age in a small geographic area with uniform management. We used data from wetlands associated with 6 wildfires that burned between 1988 and 2003 to evaluate whether burn extent and severity and interactions between wildfire and wetland isolation affected the distribution of breeding populations. We measured responses with models that accounted for imperfect detection to estimate occupancy during prefire (0-4 years) and different postfire recovery periods. For the long-toed salamander (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Ambystoma macrodactylum</i>) and Columbia spotted frog (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Rana luteiventris</i>), occupancy was not affected for 6 years after wildfire. But 7-21 years after wildfire, occupancy for both species decreased ���������25% in areas where &gt;50% of the forest within 500 m of wetlands burned. In contrast, occupancy of the boreal toad (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Anaxyrus boreas</i>) tripled in the 3 years after low-elevation forests burned. This increase in occupancy was followed by a gradual decline. Our results show that accounting for magnitude of change and time lags is critical to understanding population dynamics of amphibians after large disturbances. Our results also inform understanding of the potential threat of increases in wildfire frequency or severity to amphibians in the region."
increasing synchrony of high temperature and low flow in western north american streams: double trouble for coldwater biota?,"Flow and temperature are strongly linked environmental factors driving ecosystem processes in streams. Stream temperature maxima (T (max_w)) and stream flow minima (Q (min)) can create periods of stress for aquatic organisms. In mountainous areas, such as western North America, recent shifts toward an earlier spring peak flow and decreases in low flow during summer/fall have been reported. We hypothesized that an earlier peak flow could be shifting the timing of low flow and leading to a decrease in the interval between T (max_w) and Q (min). We also examined if years with extreme low Q (min) were associated with years of extreme high T (max_w). We tested these hypotheses using long-term data from 22 minimally human-influenced streams for the period 1950-2010. We found trends toward a shorter time lag between T (max_w) and Q (min) over time and a strong negative association between their magnitudes. Our findings show that aquatic biota may be increasingly experiencing narrower time windows to recover or adapt between these extreme events of low flow and high temperature. This study highlights the importance of evaluating multiple environmental drivers to better gage the effects of the recent climate variability in freshwaters."
aquatic insect assemblages associated with subalpine stream segment types in relict glaciated headwaters,"Aquatic habitats and biotic assemblages in subalpine headwaters are sensitive to climate and human impacts. Understanding biotic responses to such perturbations and the contribution of high-elevation headwaters to riverine biodiversity requires the assessment of assemblage composition among habitat types. We compared aquatic insect assemblages among headwater stream segment types in relict glaciated subalpine basins in Mt. Rainier National Park, Washington, USA. Aquatic insects were collected during summer and autumn in three headwater basins. In each basin, three different stream segment types were sampled: colluvial groundwater sources, alluvial lake inlets, and cascade-bedrock lake outlets. Ward's hierarchical cluster analysis revealed high diversity in aquatic insect assemblages, and non-metric multidimensional scaling indicated that spatial and temporal patterns in assemblage composition differed among headwater stream segment types. Aquatic insect assemblages showed more fidelity to stream segment types than to individual basins, and the principal environmental variables associated with assemblage structure were temperature and substrate. Indicator species analyses identified specific aquatic insects associated with each stream segment type. Several rare and potentially endemic aquatic insect taxa were present, including the recently described species, Lednia borealis (Baumann and Kondratieff). Our results indicate that aquatic insect assemblages in relict glaciated subalpine headwaters were strongly differentiated among stream segment types. These results illustrate the contribution of headwaters to riverine biodiversity and emphasise the importance of these habitats for monitoring biotic responses to climate change. Monitoring biotic assemblages in high-elevation headwaters is needed to prevent the potential loss of unique and sensitive biota."
"spatial variability of the response to climate change in regional groundwater systems - examples from simulations in the deschutes basin, oregon","We examine the spatial variability of the response of aquifer systems to climate change in and adjacent to the Cascade Range volcanic arc in the Deschutes Basin, Oregon using downscaled global climate model projections to drive surface hydrologic process and groundwater flow models. Projected warming over the 21st century is anticipated to shift the phase of precipitation toward more rain and less snow in mountainous areas in the Pacific Northwest, resulting in smaller winter snowpack and in a shift in the timing of runoff to earlier in the year. This will be accompanied by spatially variable changes in the timing of groundwater recharge. Analysis of historic climate and hydrologic data and modeling studies show that groundwater plays a key role in determining the response of stream systems to climate change. The spatial variability in the response of groundwater systems to climate change, particularly with regard to flow-system scale, however, has generally not been addressed in the literature. Here we simulate the hydrologic response to projected future climate to show that the response of groundwater systems can vary depending on the location and spatial scale of the flow systems and their aquifer characteristics. Mean annual recharge averaged over the basin does not change significantly between the 1980s and 2080s climate periods given the ensemble of global climate models and emission scenarios evaluated. There are, however, changes in the seasonality of groundwater recharge within the basin. Simulation results show that short-flow-path groundwater systems, such as those providing baseflow to many head-water streams, will likely have substantial changes in the timing of discharge in response changes in seasonality of recharge. Regional-scale aquifer systems with flow paths on the order of many tens of kilometers, in contrast, are much less affected by changes in seasonality of recharge. Flow systems at all spatial scales, however, are likely to reflect interannual changes in total recharge. These results provide insights into the possible impacts of climate change to other regional aquifer systems, and the streams they support, where discharge points represent a range of flow system scales.

pest outbreak distribution and forest management impacts in a changing climate in british columbia,"This paper examines the risks associated with forest insect outbreaks in a changing climate from biological and forest management perspectives. Two important Canadian insects were considered: western spruce budworm (WSBW; Choristoneura occidentalis Freeman, Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), and spruce bark beetle (SBB; Dendroctonus rufipennis Kirby, Coleoptera: Curculionidae). This paper integrates projections of tree species suitability, pest outbreak risk, and bio-economic modelling. Several methods of estimating pest outbreak risk were investigated. A simple climate envelope method based on empirically derived climate thresholds indicates substantial changes in the distribution of outbreaks in British Columbia for two climate scenarios and both pests. A ""proof of concept"" bio-economic model, to inform forest management decisions in a changing climate, considers major stand-level harvest decision factors, such as preservation of old-growth forest, and even harvest flow rates in the presence of changing tree species suitability and outbreak risk. The model was applied to data for the Okanagan Timber Supply Area and also the entire Province of British Columbia. At the provincial level, the model determined little net timber production impact, depending on which of two climate scenarios was considered. Several potentially important factors not considered in this first version of the model are discussed, which indicates that impact may be underestimated by this preliminary study. Despite these factors, negative impacts were projected at the Okanagan Timber Supply Area level for both scenarios. Policy implications are described as well as guidance for future work to determine impacts of climate change on future distribution and abundance of forest resources. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

a stochastic conceptual modeling approach for examining the effects of climate change on streamflows in mountain basins,"This study presents a modeling approach for examining how changes in climate affect streamflow in mesoscale mountain basins dominated by snowmelt runoff. A conceptual snowmelt-runoff model was developed that is forced by daily time series of temperature and precipitation. The model can be run using either observed climate data or artificial climate data generated from a GCM or a stochastic model. The model was applied to a case-study basin, the north fork of the Clearwater River in Idaho, using stochastically generated climate scenarios. Climate scenarios were generated using a contemporaneous auto-regressive integrated moving average (CARIMA) model for temperature and a precipitation model based on a two-state first-order Markov process. A baseline climate scenario was developed that represents recently observed temperature and precipitation conditions and then 15 additional climate scenarios that represent shifts in recent conditions. For each scenario, model application produced an ensemble of 50 streamflow traces each spanning 30 yr. Results show that an increase in temperature among scenarios leads to a decrease in streamflow and vice versa. Decreases in temperature shift the basin runoff to fully snowmelt dominated, whereas increases in temperature increase the frequency of midwinter runoff events. Increasing precipitation leads to increased runoff in cases where the temperature remains the same as the observed record, but not in cases where the temperature increases. The modeling approach presented here can be used by water managers to examine which types of climate change could require modifications in water planning and operations."
sensitivity of the snowcover energetics in a mountain basin to variations in climate,"Snow is an important natural reservoir that holds water on the landscape for release later in the season in western North America and other portions of the world. As air temperature increases with global climate change, the character of the generally established seasonal snowcover will be affected. To study the specific response to variable climate, a carefully collected and processed meteorological data set for the 1984-2008 water years (WYs) was assembled for a snow-dominated headwater mountain catchment. The data were used to force a physically based, distributed energy balance snow model to simulate patterns of snow deposition and melt over the catchment for the 25-year period. This period covers both the highest (1984) and lowest (1992) snow seasons on record and exhibits extreme inter-annual variability. This unique forcing data set captured meteorological conditions that resulted in the range of variability in snowcover accumulation, timing of ablation, and the timing and amount of surface water input (SWI), and discharge during the 25-year study period. SWI is the amount of liquid water delivered to the soil surface from melting snow or from rain that passes through the snowcover or falls directly on the soil. Warm winters, characterized by early-and mid-winter rain, triggered earlier inputs from SWI and response in discharge than cool winters. Cool conditions prolonged the generation of SWI and streamflow out of the basin. Very wet conditions that were warm passed 50% of the SWI 27 days earlier and passed 50% of the discharge 15 days earlier, when compared to very wet conditions that were cool. Warmer conditions produced less snow water equivalent, shortened the melt season, and would be expected to extend the summer drought. Copyright. (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
"interactive effects of wildfire, forest management, and isolation on amphibian and parasite abundance","Projected increases in wildfire and other climate-driven disturbances will affect populations and communities worldwide, including host-parasite relationships. Research in temperate forests has shown that wildfire can negatively affect amphibians, but this research has occurred primarily outside of managed landscapes where interactions with human disturbances could result in additive or synergistic effects. Furthermore, parasites represent a large component of biodiversity and can affect host fitness and population dynamics, yet they are rarely included in studies of how vertebrate hosts respond to disturbance. To determine how wildfire affects amphibians and their parasites, and whether effects differ between protected and managed landscapes, we compared abundance of two amphibians and two nematodes relative to wildfire extent and severity around wetlands in neighboring protected and managed forests (Montana, USA). Population sizes of adult, male long-toed salamanders (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Ambystoma macrodactylum</i>) decreased with increased burn severity, with stronger negative effects on isolated populations and in managed forests. In contrast, breeding population sizes of Columbia spotted frogs (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Rana luteiventris</i>) increased with burn extent in both protected and managed protected forests. Path analysis showed that the effects of wildfire on the two species of nematodes were consistent with differences in their life history and transmission strategies and the responses of their hosts. Burn severity indirectly reduced abundance of soil-transmitted <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Cosmocercoides variabilis</i> through reductions in salamander abundance. Burn severity also directly reduced <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">C. variabilis</i> abundance, possibly though changes in soil conditions. For the aquatically transmitted nematode <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Gyrinicola batrachiensis</i>, the positive effect of burn extent on density of Columbia spotted frog larvae indirectly increased parasite abundance. Our results show that effects of wildfire on amphibians depend upon burn extent and severity, isolation, and prior land use. Through subsequent effects on the parasites, our results also reveal how changes in disturbance regimes can affect communities across trophic levels."
"implications of climate-driven variability and trends for the hydrologic assessment of the reynolds creek experimental watershed, idaho","The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was used to assess the implications of long-term climate trends for the hydroclimatology of the Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed (RCEW) in the Owyhee Mountains, Idaho of the Intermountain West over a 40-year period (1967-2006). Calibration and validation of the macroscale hydrology model in this highly monitored watershed is key to address the watershed processes that are vulnerable to both natural climate variability and climate change. The model was calibrated using the streamflow data collected between 1997 and 2006 from the three nested weirs, the Reynolds Mountain East (RME), Tollgate and Outlet. For assessing the performance of the calibrated model, this study used 30 years of streamflow data for the period between 1966 and 1996. This investigation suggested that the model predicted streamflow was best at RME, and inadequate at Outlet. Simulated soil moisture was also verified using the data available from five soil moisture measurement sites. The model was able to capture the seasonal patterns of changes in soil water storage considering the differences in the spatial extent of the observed and predicted soil water storage (point measurements against the spatially averaged values for the HRU) and uncertainty associated with the soil moisture measurements due to instrument effects. Water budget partitioning during a wet (1984) water year and a dry (1987) water year were also analyzed to characterize the differences in hydrologic cycles during the extreme hydrologic conditions. Our analysis showed that in the dry water year, vegetation at the higher elevation were under water stress by the end of the water year. Contrastingly, in the wet water year only the vegetation at low and mid-elevations were under water stress whereas vegetation at the higher elevations derived substantial soil moisture for ET processes even towards the end of the growing season. To understand the effect of climate change on the hydrologic cycle, the observed and simulated streamflow were analyzed for trends in Center of Timing (CT). Earlier CT timings for the simulated and observed streamflow at RME weir was obvious thus manifesting global warming signals at the watershed scale level in the Intermountain west region. Observed streamflow at the Tollgate and Outlet weirs, where streamflow is partially affected by the agricultural diversions, showed later CT timings and these results appeared to suggest that climate impact assessment studies need to carefully distinguish the system behavior that is altered by both natural and human-induced changes.

"spatial-temporal analysis of species range expansion: the case of the mountain pine beetle, dendroctonus ponderosae","Aim The spatial extent of western Canada's current epidemic of mountain pine beetle, Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins (Coleoptera: Curculionidae, Scolytinae), is increasing. The roles of the various dispersal processes acting as drivers of range expansion are poorly understood for most species. The aim of this paper is to characterize the movement patterns of the mountain pine beetle in areas where range expansion is occurring, in order to describe the fine-scale spatial dynamics of processes associated with mountain pine beetle range expansion. Location Three regions of Canada's Rocky Mountains: Kicking Horse Pass, Yellowhead Pass and Pine Pass. Methods Data on locations of mountain pine beetle-attacked trees of predominantly lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia) were obtained from annual fixed-wing aircraft surveys of forest health and helicopter-based GPS surveys of mountain pine beetle-damaged areas in British Columbia and Alberta. The annual (1999-2005) spatial extents of outbreak ranges were delineated from these data. Spatial analysis was conducted using the spatial-temporal analysis of moving polygons (STAMP), a recently developed pattern-based approach. Results We found that distant dispersal patterns (spot infestations) were most often associated with marginal increases in the areal size of mountain pine beetle range polygons. When the mountain pine beetle range size increased rapidly relative to the years examined, local dispersal patterns (adjacent infestation) were more common. In Pine Pass, long-range dispersal (> 2 km) markedly extended the north-east border of the mountain pine beetle range. In Yellowhead Pass and Kicking Horse Pass, the extension of the range occurred incrementally via ground-based spread. Main conclusions Dispersal of mountain pine beetle varies with geography as well as with host and beetle population dynamics. Although colonization is mediated by habitat connectivity, during periods of low overall habitat expansion, dispersal to new distant locations is common, whereas during periods of rapid invasion, locally connected spread is the dominant mode of dispersal. The propensity for long-range transport to establish new beetle populations, and thus to be considered a driver of range expansion, is likely to be determined by regional weather patterns, and influenced by local topography. We conclude that STAMP appears to be a useful approach for examining changes in biogeograpical ranges, with the potential to reveal both fine- and large-scale patterns."
freshwater ecosystems and resilience of pacific salmon: habitat management based on natural variability,"In spite of numerous habitat restoration programs in fresh waters with an aggregate annual funding of millions of dollars, many populations of Pacific salmon remain significantly imperiled. Habitat restoration strategies that address limited environmental attributes and partial salmon life-history requirements or approaches that attempt to force aquatic habitat to conform to idealized but ecologically unsustainable conditions may partly explain this lack of response. Natural watershed processes generate highly variable environmental conditions and population responses, i.e., multiple life histories, that are often not considered in restoration. Examples from several locations underscore the importance of natural variability to the resilience of Pacific salmon. The implication is that habitat restoration efforts will be more likely to foster salmon resilience if they consider processes that generate and maintain natural variability in fresh water. We identify three specific criteria for management based on natural variability: the capacity of aquatic habitat to recover from disturbance, a range of habitats distributed across stream networks through time sufficient to fulfill the requirements of diverse salmon life histories, and ecological connectivity. In light of these considerations, we discuss current threats to habitat resilience and describe how regulatory and restoration approaches can be modified to better incorporate natural variability."
"impact of climate change on north cascade alpine glaciers, and alpine runoff","Analysis of key components of the alpine North Cascade hydrologic system indicate significant changes in glacier mass balance, terminus behavior, alpine snowpack, and alpine streamflow from 1950 to 2005. North Cascade glacier retreat is rapid and ubiquitous. All 47 monitored glaciers are currently undergoing a significant retreat and four of them have disappeared. Annual mass balance measured on ten glaciers, averaging 30-50 m in thickness, yields a mean cumulative annual balance for the 1984-2006 period of -12.4 m water equivalent (m we), a net loss of 14 m in glacier thickness and 20-40% loss of their total volume in two decades. The data indicate broad regional continuity in North Cascades glacial response to climate. The substantial negative annual balances have accompanied significant thinning in the accumulation zone of 75% of North Cascade glaciers monitored. This is indicative of glacier disequilibrium; a glacier in disequilibrium will not survive the current warmer climate trend. Alpine snowpack snow water equivalent (SWE) on April I has declined 25% since 1946 at five USDA Snow Course sites. This decline has occurred in spite of a slight increase in winter precipitation. The combination of a decline in winter snowpack and a 0.6 degrees increase in ablation season temperature, during the 1946-2005 period in the North Cascades, has altered alpine strearnflow in six North Cascade basins. Observed changes in streamflow are: increased winter streamflow, slightly declining spring strearnflow and a 27% decline in summer strearnflow. Only in the heavily glaciated Thunder Creek Basin (>10% glaciated) has summer strearnflow declined less than 10%; this is attributable to enhanced glacier melting."
integrating climate change into forest management in south-central british columbia: an assessment of landscape vulnerability and development of a climate-smart framework,"The achievement of sustainable forest management requires the incorporation of risk and uncertainty into long-term planning. Climatic change will have significant impacts on natural disturbances, species and ecosystems, particularly on landscapes influenced by forest management. Understanding where vulnerabilities lie is important in managing the risks associated directly or indirectly with climatic change. The vulnerability of landscapes to natural disturbances, the resilience of ecosystems and distribution of species are all important components that need to be considered when undertaking forest planning, but climatic change is rarely factored into such planning. In this study, the vulnerability of fire potential, fire regimes, ecosystems and species to climatic change was modelled for a 145,000 ha landscape in the south-central interior of British Columbia, Canada. The results from these analyses were used to guide forest zoning, using the triad zoning framework, and for the development of a ""climate-smart"" management framework. The use of climate-smart management is advocated as a decision-making framework for managing forested landscapes based on an understanding of landscape vulnerability to future climatic change. From this understanding, the maintenance of ecosystem health and vitality could be achieved. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
a tree and climate assessment tool for modelling ecosystem response to climate change,"Understanding how vulnerable forest ecosystems are to climate change is a key requirement if sustainable forest management is to be achieved. Modelling the response of species in their regeneration niche to phenological and biophysical processes that are directly influenced by climate is one method for achieving this understanding. A model was developed to investigate species resilience and vulnerability to climate change within its fundamental-regeneration niche. The utility of the developed model, tree and climate assessment (TACA), was tested within the interior Douglas-fir ecosystem in south-central British Columbia. TACA modelled the current potential tree species composition of the ecosystem with high accuracy and modelled significant responses amongst tree species to climate change. The response of individual species suggests that the studied ecosystem could transition to a new ecosystem over the next 100 years. TACA showed that it can be an effective tool for identifying species resilience and vulnerability to changes in climate within the most sensitive stage of development, the regeneration phase. The TACA model was able to identify the degree of change in phenological and biophysical variables that control tree establishment, growth and persistence. The response to changes in one or more of these variables resulted in changes in the climatic suitability of the ecosystem for species and enabled a measure of vulnerability to be quantified. TACA could be useful to forest managers as a decision support tool for adaptation actions and by researchers interested in modelling stand dynamics under climate change. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

influence of fire regimes on lodgepole pine stand age and density across the yellowstone national park (usa) landscape,"A probabilistic spatial model was created based on empirical data to examine the influence of different fire regimes on stand structure of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia) forests across a > 500,000-ha landscape in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, USA. We asked how variation in the frequency of large fire events affects (1) the mean and annual variability of age and tree density (defined by postfire sapling density and subsequent stand density) of lodgepole pine stands and (2) the spatial pattern of stand age and density across the landscape. The model incorporates spatial and temporal variation in fire and serotiny in predicting postfire sapling densities of lodgepole pine. Empirical self-thinning and in-filling curves alter initital postfire sapling densities over decades to centuries. In response to a six-fold increase in the probability of large fires (0.003 to 0.018 year), mean stand age declined from 291 to 121 years. Mean stand density did not increase appreciably at high elevations (1,029 to 1,249 stems ha(-1)) where serotiny was low and postfire sapling density was relatively low (1,252 to 2,203 stems ha(-1)). At low elevations, where prefire serotiny and postfire lodgepole pine density are high, mean stand densities increased from 2,807 to 7,664 stems ha(-1). Spatially, the patterns of stand age became more simplified across the landscape, yet patterns of stand density became more complex. In response to more frequent stand replacing fires, very high annual variability in postfire sapling density is expected, with higher means and greater variation in stand density across lodgepole pine landscapes, especially in the few decades following large fires."
"atmospheric, climatic, and ecological controls on extreme wildfire years in the northwestern united states","Wildland fire is an important disturbance agent in forests of the American Northwest. Historical fire suppression efforts have contributed to an accumulation of fuels in many Northwestern forests and may result in more frequent and/or more severe wildfire events. Here we investigate the extent to which Atmospheric and climatic variability may contribute to variability in annual area burned on 20 National Forests in. Washington,,Oregon, and Idaho. Empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis was used to identify coherent patterns in area burned by wildfire in the Pacific Northwest. Anomaly fields of 500-hPa height were regressed onto the resulting principal-component time series.,to identify the patterns in atmospheric circulation that are associated with variability in area burned by wildfire. Additionally, cross-correlation functions were calculated for the Palmer drought severity index (PDSI) over the year preceding the wildfire season. Parallel analyses based on superposed epoch analysis focused only on the extreme fire years (both large and small) to discriminate the controls on extreme years from the linear responses identified in the regression analyses. Four distinct patterns in area burned were identified, each associated,with distinct-climatic processes. Extreme wildfire years are forced at least in part by antecedent drought and summertime blocking,in the 500-hPa height field. However the response to these forcing's is modulated by the ecology of the dominant forest. In more mesic forest types. antecedent, drought is a necessary precondition for forests to burn, but it is not a good predictor of area burned due to the rarity of subsequent ignition. At especially dry locations, summertime blocking events can lead to increases in area burned even in the absence of antecedent drought. At particularly xeric locations summertime cyclones can also lead to increased area burned, probably due to dry lightning storms that bring ignition and strong winds but little precipitation.. These results suggest that fuels treatments alone may not be effective at reducing area burned under extreme climatic conditions and furthermore that anthropogenic climate change may have important implications for forest management."
post-fire aspen seedling recruitment across the yellowstone (usa) landscape,"Landscape patterns of quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) seedling occurrence and abundance were studied after a rare recruitment event following the 1988 fires in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, USA. Belt transects (1 to 17 km in length, 4 m width) along 18 foot trails were surveyed for aspen seedlings on the subalpine plateau of the Park, along gradients of elevation and geologic substrate, during the summer of 1996. Aspen seedling presence and density were characterized as a function of elevation, geologic substrate, slope, aspect, vegetation/ cover type, presence of burned forest, and distance to nearest adult aspen stand. Presence of aspen seedlings was best predicted by the incidence of burned forest and proximity to adult aspen; aspen seedlings were only found in burned forest and were more likely to occur closer to adult aspen clones. When tested against independent data collected in 1997, the logistic regression model for aspen seedling presence performed well ( overall accuracy = 73%, Tau(p) = 0.41). When present, variation in aspen seedling density at local scales (less than or equal to 200 m) was largely explained by elevation, with higher densities observed at lower elevations. At broad scales (> 1 km), seedling density was a function of cover type, elevation, aspect, slope, and burn severity, with greater seedling density in more severely burned forested habitats on southerly, shallow slopes at lower elevations. Aspen seedling densities ranged from 0 to 46,000 seedlings/ha with a median density of 2,000/ha on sites where they occurred. Aspen seedlings were most abundant in the south central and southwest central regions of the park, approximately an order of magnitude less abundant in the southeast region, and nearly absent in the north central area. Establishment of new aspen stands on Yellowstone's subalpine plateau would represent a substantial change in the landscape. However, the long-term fate of these postfire aspen seedlings is not known."
"effects of environment and grazing disturbance on tree establishment in meadows of the central cascade range, oregon, usa","Within the last century there has been widespread establishment of trees in mountain meadows of the Pacific Northwest. We reconstructed patterns of tree invasion at 17 meadow sites in the central Cascade Range of Oregon, USA - sites representing diverse physical environments and vegetation types and experiencing different histories of recent anthropogenic disturbance(sheep grazing). Spatial distributions and age structures of invasive tree populations were analysed with respect to climatic records and grazing history. Patterns of establishment varied considerably among meadows, reflecting strong differences in environment and grazing history. In montane hydric meadows, tree establishment was spatially clumped beneath large old trees and on elevated microsites; however the timing of invasion differed between sites with stable versus fluctuating water tables. in upland mesic/dry montane meadows, timing of invasion corresponded with cessation of sheep grazing (early 1940s) and the onset of wetter summers (mid 1940s). In the subalpine zone, climate and aspect interacted to produce contrasting histories of invasion on north- and south-facing slopes. Establishment on north-facing slopes, concentrated in heath-shrub communities, coincided with regional warming (ca. 1920-1945) when snowpacks were lighter and melted earlier. Recruitment of trees onto south-facing slopes occurred later, when conditions were wetter (1945-1985). In many environments, the spatial distribution of recruitment suggests that once trees have established, autogenic factors become increasingly important as individual trees or groups of trees alter the physical or biotic conditions that once inhibited establishment. Knowledge of the factors that influence invasion, and of their varying importance across gradients in environment and vegetation, is critical to predicting future changes in these dynamic systems."
effect of climate change on hydrologic regime of two climatically different watersheds,"Hydrologic modeling of the responses of two study watersheds to climate change is presented. The watersheds are the Upper Campbell and the Illecillewaet watersheds located in British Columbia. The first is a maritime watershed located on the eastern slopes of the Vancouver Island mountains; the second is located in the Selkirk Mountains in Eastern British Columbia. The Canadian Climate Centre General Circulation model has been used for the prediction of potential effects of climate change on meteorological parameters. In addition to the changes in the amounts of precipitation and temperature usually assumed in hydrologic climate change studies, other meteorological and climatic parameters also considered are the effect of climate on the spatial distribution of precipitation with elevation, as well as on cloud cover, glaciers, vegetation distribution, vegetation biomass production, and plant physiology. The results showed that the mean annual temperature in the two watersheds could increase by more than 3 degrees C and the annual basinwide precipitation could increase by 7.5% in the Upper Campbell watershed and by about 17% in the Illecillewaet watershed. The higher temperatures changed some snowfall to rainfall and the extra precipitation was mainly in the form of rain. The increase of the CO(2) concentration caused stomata closure that reduced evapotranspiration. This effect was compensated by increased biomass in the Upper Campbell watershed, but not in the Illecillewaet watershed. These changes produced higher flows in winter and smaller flows in summer. The largest change in the hydrograph shape was in the Illecillewaet watershed where the mean annual maximum daily flow decreased by about 13% and its frequency was reduced. On the other hand, the mean annual runoff increased by 21%. In contrast, although the shape of the simulated annual hydrograph of the Upper Campbell watershed was not affected, magnitude and frequency of the annual maximum precipitation increased. Also, the mean annual runoff in the Upper Campbell watershed increased by 7.5%. These results indicate that different management procedures may be needed to minimize the effects of climate change on the water resources of the two climatically different watersheds and the regions that they represent."
thermal limits to salmonid distributions in the rocky mountain region and potential habitat loss due to global warming: a geographic information system (gis) approach,"The present distribution of salmonid fishes in Wyoming streams was found to be limited to regions where mean July air temperatures did not exceed 22 degrees C. Much of the present salmonid habitat in streams is predicted to be lost if climatic warming occurs. For increases of 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 degrees C in mean July air temperature, the geographic area of Wyoming containing suitable salmonid habitat would be reduced by 16.2, 29.1, 38.5, 53.3, or 68.0%, respectively. This loss of geographic range would correspond to reductions of 7.5, 13.6, 21.0, 31.4, or 43.3% in the length of streams having suitable salmonid habitat. In the Rocky Mountain region, increases of 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 degrees C in mean July air temperature would reduce the geographic area containing suitable salmonid habitat by 16.8, 35.6, 49.8, 62.0, or 71.8%, respectively. As warming proceeds, salmonid populations would be forced into increasingly higher elevations and would become fragmented as suitable habitat for coldwater fish becomes separated from main river channels and restricted to headwater streams. A geographic information system (GIS) proved useful for combining the various databases necessary to assess the potential impact of global warming on salmonid populations."
the cold-water climate shield: delineating refugia for preserving salmonid fishes through the 21st century,"The distribution and future fate of ectothermic organisms in a warming world will be dictated by thermalscapes across landscapes. That is particularly true for stream fishes and cold-water species like trout, salmon, and char that are already constrained to high elevations and latitudes. The extreme climates in those environments also preclude invasions by most non-native species, so identifying especially cold habitats capable of absorbing future climate change while still supporting native populations would highlight important refugia. By coupling crowd-sourced biological datasets with high-resolution stream temperature scenarios, we delineate network refugia across >250000 stream km in the Northern Rocky Mountains for two native salmonidsbull trout (BT) and cutthroat trout (CT). Under both moderate and extreme climate change scenarios, refugia with high probabilities of trout population occupancy (>0.9) were predicted to exist (33-68 BT refugia; 917-1425 CT refugia). Most refugia are on public lands (>90%) where few currently have protected status in National Parks or Wilderness Areas (<15%). Forecasts of refuge locations could enable protection of key watersheds and provide a foundation for climate smart planning of conservation networks. Using cold water as a climate shield' is generalizable to other species and geographic areas because it has a strong physiological basis, relies on nationally available geospatial data, and mines existing biological datasets. Importantly, the approach creates a framework to integrate data contributed by many individuals and resource agencies, and a process that strengthens the collaborative and social networks needed to preserve many cold-water fish populations through the 21st century."
representative regional models of post-disturbance forest carbon accumulation: integrating inventory data and a growth and yield model,"Disturbance is a key driver of carbon (C) dynamics in forests. Insect epidemics, wildfires, and timber harvest have greatly affected North American C budgets in the last century. Research is needed to understand how forest C dynamics (source duration and recovery time) following disturbance vary as a function of disturbance type, severity, forest type, and initial C stocks. We used the Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS) to simulate total C stocks (excluding soil) for 100 years following three types of disturbance (fire, harvest, and insects) with four levels of severity. We initiated the model using empirical data from a large representative sample of forest conditions on the national forest ownership in the Rocky Mountain region (Forest Inventory and Analysis data). Unlike analyses based on stand age, an ambiguous quantity with respect to disturbance history, our approach enables explicit consideration of disturbance type and severity, as well as pre-disturbance forest C. On average, stands became a C sink after fire in 5, 6, 14, and 23 years for low to high-severity fire. Pre-fire C stocks were reached 25-55 years later. Following bark beetle epidemics, on average stands continued to be a C source for 10 years longer than fire and up to 40 years longer in some cases, but pre-disturbance C stocks were reached in a similar amount of time. C stocks following harvest showed the largest initial decline, but on average stands became a sink sooner at 1, 5, 15, and 12 years post-harvest for low to high-severity harvests. Differences in C dynamics based on disturbance type and severity, initial conditions, and forest type demonstrate the importance of considering this variability when modeling forest C dynamics. The regionally averaged models of C response quantified in this study can be combined with remotely sensed data on disturbance type and severity and used with C accounting approaches that rely on growth and yield or state and transition models.

"modeling cold tolerance in the mountain pine beetle, dendroctonus ponderosae","Cold-induced mortality is a key factor driving mountain pine beetle, <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Dendroctonus ponderosae</i>, population dynamics. In this species, the supercooling point (SCP) is representative of mortality induced by acute cold exposure. Mountain pine beetle SCP and associated cold-induced mortality fluctuate throughout a generation, with the highest SCPs prior to and following winter. Using observed SCPs of field-collected <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">D. ponderosae</i> larvae throughout the developmental season and associated phloem temperatures, we developed a mechanistic model that describes the SCP distribution of a population as a function of daily changes in the temperature-dependent processes leading to gain and loss of cold tolerance. It is based on the changing proportion of individuals in three states: (1) a non cold-hardened, feeding state, (2) an intermediate state in which insects have ceased feeding, voided their gut content and eliminated as many ice-nucleating agents as possible from the body, and (3) a fully cold-hardened state where insects have accumulated a maximum concentration of cryoprotectants (e.g. glycerol). Shifts in the proportion of individuals in each state occur in response to the driving variables influencing the opposite rates of gain and loss of cold hardening. The level of cold-induced mortality predicted by the model and its relation to extreme winter temperature is in good agreement with a range of field and laboratory observations. Our model predicts that cold tolerance of <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">D. ponderosae</i> varies within a season, among seasons, and among geographic locations depending on local climate. This variability is an emergent property of the model, and has important implications for understanding the insect's response to seasonal fluctuations in temperature, as well as population response to climate change. Because cold-induced mortality is but one of several major influences of climate on <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">D. ponderosae</i> population dynamics, we suggest that this model be integrated with others simulating the insect's biology."
pyrogenic carbon controls across a soil catena in the pacific northwest,"Since turnover times of pyrogenic carbon (PyC) are substantially slower than those of other organic carbon input to soil, it is considered an important constituent of the global C cycle acting as a C sink. In the Pacific Northwest vegetation fires regularly produce PyC, but its accumulation in soils is poorly quantified. Using mid-infrared spectroscopy (MIR) and partial least-squares (PLS) analysis in conjunction with ultraviolet photo-oxidation followed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (UV-NMR) techniques, PyC contents were quantified for samples from soil profiles along a vegetation gradient. Sample locations included different forest types as well as sites under agricultural use. While PyC was most prevalent in the first 0.2 m with 7-24% of total soil organic C (SOC), it could be found in the subsoil of all locations. However, PyC concentrations did not change consistently with soil depth. Stock sizes were lowest at the Turkey Farm (0.71 kg m(-2); 10% of SOC) and Organic Growers Farm (1.14 kg m(-2); 8% of SOC) sites, presumably due to the pervasive combustion of grass and cereals. Among the forested sites, lower stocks were observed at sites with higher mean annual temperature (MAT) and lower mean annual precipitation (MAP) such as Metolius (1.71 kg m(-2); 15% of SOC) and Juniper (1.89 kg m(-2); 26% of SOC). In contrast, the highest PyC stocks were found under cooler and moister conditions at Cascade Head dominated by Douglas Fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.)) (5.66 kg m(-2); 16% of SOC) and Soapgrass Mountain (4.80 kg m(-2); 15% of SOC). PyC was only moderately related to non-PyC SOC, which comprises plant residues, their decomposition products and soil biota (r(2) = 0.61 and 0.44 for SOC with and without PyC, respectively), suggesting largely independent processes influencing production and disappearance.

"climate, fire size, and biophysical setting control fire severity and spatial pattern in the northern cascade range, usa","Warmer and drier climate over the past few decades has brought larger fire sizes and increased annual area burned in forested ecosystems of western North America, and continued increases in annual area burned are expected due to climate change. As warming continues, fires may also increase in severity and produce larger contiguous patches of severely burned areas. We used remotely sensed burn-severity data from 125 fires in the northern Cascade Range of Washington, USA, to explore relationships between fire size, severity, and the spatial pattern of severity. We examined relationships between climate and the annual area burned and the size of wildfires over a 25-year period. We tested the hypothesis that increased fire size is commensurate with increased burn severity and increased spatial aggregation of severely burned areas. We also asked how local ecological controls might modulate these relationships by comparing results over the whole study area (the northern Cascade Range) to those from four ecological subsections within it. We found significant positive relationships between climate and fire size, and between fire size and the proportion of high severity and spatial-pattern metrics that quantify the spatial aggregation of high-severity areas within fires, but the strength and significance of these relationships varied among the four subsections. In areas with more contiguous subalpine forests and less complex topography, the proportion and spatial aggregation of severely burned areas were more strongly correlated with fire size. If fire sizes increase in a warming climate, changes in the extent, severity, and spatial pattern of fire regimes are likely to be more pronounced in higher-severity fire regimes with less complex topography and more continuous fuels."
"climate, weather, and recent mountain pine beetle outbreaks in the western united states","Recent outbreaks of mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) have impacted large areas of western North America. Climate and weather conditions influence beetle population dynamics, and managers and policymakers are concerned about the potential effects of climate change on outbreaks. Here we studied five locations with extensive outbreaks in lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) forests across the western United States. Using observations and modeling, we quantified means and changes relative to prior years of three climate or weather factors associated with outbreaks: (1) year-round temperatures that affect adaptive seasonality; (2) low temperatures that induce mortality of overwintering beetles; and (3) drought stress of host trees. Climate variable means varied among locations, indicating the beetle's tolerance to different climate during outbreaks. Analyses of climate or weather factors as outbreaks progressed revealed that year-round temperatures during outbreaks were typically higher than in prior years, and outbreak years lacked very low winter temperatures that often occurred in prior years. Drought was present at each location during some time of an outbreak, and increases in beetle-caused tree mortality at lower beetle population levels (as indicated by killed trees) were usually coincident with drought. Furthermore, drought was not required to maintain large outbreaks; in several locations, relief from drought during periods of high tree mortality did not cause subsequent declines in tree mortality. We did not find strong evidence that maladaptive seasonality, cold-induced mortality, or drought stress was responsible for decreases in tree mortality, suggesting the role of host depletion. Large variability in the relationships between climate or weather variables and outbreaks suggests that different climate and weather factors may have been limiting outbreaks at different times and that these factors did not influence beetle-caused tree mortality similarly among locations. Our results increase understanding of the climate and weather factors that influence beetle outbreaks and their variability in space and time and will lead to more accurate predictions of future patterns of outbreaks that consider future climate.

climate change and stream temperature projections in the columbia river basin: habitat implications of spatial variation in hydrologic drivers,"Water temperature is a primary physical factor regulating the persistence and distribution of aquatic taxa. Considering projected increases in air temperature and changes in precipitation in the coming century, accurate assessment of suitable thermal habitats in freshwater systems is critical for predicting aquatic species' responses to changes in climate and for guiding adaptation strategies. We use a hydrologic model coupled with a stream temperature model and downscaled general circulation model outputs to explore the spatially and temporally varying changes in stream temperature for the late 21st century at the subbasin and ecological province scale for the Columbia River basin (CRB). On average, stream temperatures are projected to increase 3.5 degrees C for the spring, 5.2 degrees C for the summer, 2.7 degrees C for the fall, and 1.6 degrees C for the winter. While results indicate changes in stream temperature are correlated with changes in air temperature, our results also capture the important, and often ignored, influence of hydrological processes on changes in stream temperature. Decreases in future snowcover will result in increased thermal sensitivity within regions that were previously buffered by the cooling effect of flow originating as snowmelt. Other hydrological components, such as precipitation, surface runoff, lateral soil water flow, and groundwater inflow, are negatively correlated to increases in stream temperature depending on the ecological province and season. At the ecological province scale, the largest increase in annual stream temperature was within the Mountain Snake ecological province, which is characterized by migratory coldwater fish species. Stream temperature changes varied seasonally with the largest projected stream temperature increases occurring during the spring and summer for all ecological provinces. Our results indicate that stream temperatures are driven by local processes and ultimately require a physically explicit modeling approach to accurately characterize the habitat regulating the distribution and diversity of aquatic taxa."
assessing possible shifts in wildfire regimes under a changing climate in mountainous landscapes,"Climate change may affect the probability of extreme events such as wildfires. Although wildfires are some of the most important ecological processes in forest ecosystems, large-scale wildfires are often perceived as an environmental disaster. Since failure to include the dynamic nature of ecosystems in planning will inevitably lead to unexpected outcomes, we need to enhance our ability to cope with future extreme events coupled with climate change. This study presents several future scenarios in three different time periods for Canada's Columbia Montane Cordillera Ecoprovince, which is prone to wildfires. These scenarios predict the probability of occurrence of widespread wildfires based on the hierarchical Bayesian model. The model was based on the relationships between wildfires and the Monthly Drought Code (MDC). The MDC is a generalized monthly version of the Daily Drought Code widely used across Canada by forest fire management agencies for monitoring of wildfire risk. To calculate future MDC values, we relied on different possible future conditions of climate, given by the Global Circulation Models. We found a regime shift in drought intensity with abrupt decreases in lightning-caused wildfire activity around 1940, suggesting that future wildfire risks can be inferred primarily from the summer drought code. For future periods, we found increasing trends in the probabilities of large-scale fires with time in most areas. It should be notable that, by the 2080s, there is a probability of some areas having more than 50% of large-scale wildfires under the ""average"" climatic conditions in the future, indicating that, even without ""extreme"" weather conditions, some ecosystems will have a fundamental probability of experiencing catastrophic fires under the condition of average summer. However, the rate of progression toward a fire-prone condition is quite different among the three climate change scenarios and among the region analyzed. Given such scenario-sensitive, spatially-heterogeneous patterns of wildfire probability in response to climate variability, management strategy should be flexible and more localized. By drawing on this knowledge, it may be possible to mitigate climate change impacts both before they arise and once they have occurred. These considerations are critical for maintaining the integrity of systems shaped by large-scale natural disturbances to increase their resilience to the changing climate while protecting human society and infrastructures. Working with alternative scenarios will facilitate our adaptation to climate change in managing fire-prone forest ecosystems. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
charred forests increase snowmelt: effects of burned woody debris and incoming solar radiation on snow ablation,"We document effects of postfire forest conditions on snow accumulation, albedo, and ablation in the Oregon Cascades. We measured snow water equivalent, solar radiation, snow albedo, and snowpack surface debris at a pair of burned and unburned forest plots. Snow accumulation was greater in the burned forest; however, the snowpack disappeared 23days earlier and had twice the ablation rate than in the unburned forest. Snow albedo was 40% lower in the burned forest during ablation, while approximately 60% more solar radiation reached the snow surface, driving a 200% increase in net shortwave radiation. Significant amounts of pyrogenic carbon particles and larger burned woody debris shed from standing charred trees accumulated on the snowpack and darkened its surface. Spatial analysis showed that across the Western U.S., 80% of all forest fires occurred in the seasonal snow zone, and were 4.4 times larger than fires outside the seasonal snow zone."
sensitivity of salmonid freshwater life history in western us streams to future climate conditions,"We projected effects of mid-21st century climate on the early life growth of Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and steelhead (O.mykiss) in western United States streams. Air temperature and snowpack trends projected from observed 20th century trends were used to predict future seasonal stream temperatures. Fish growth from winter to summer was projected with temperature-dependent models of egg development and juvenile growth. Based on temperature data from 115 sites, by mid-21st century, the effects of climate change are projected to be mixed. Fish in warm-region streams that are currently cooled by snow melt will grow less, and fish in suboptimally cool streams will grow more. Relative to 20th century conditions, by mid-21st century juvenile salmonids' weights are expected to be lower in the Columbia Basin and California Central Valley, but unchanged or greater in coastal and mountain streams. Because fish weight affects fish survival, the predicted changes in weight could impact population fitness depending on other factors such as density effects, food quality and quantity changes, habitat alterations, etc. The level of year-to-year variability in stream temperatures is high and our analysis suggests that identifying effects of climate change over the natural variability will be difficult except in a few streams."
anticipating stream ecosystem responses to climate change: toward predictions that incorporate effects via land-water linkages,"Climate change (CC) is projected to increase the frequency and severity of natural disturbances (wildfires, insect outbreaks, and debris flows) and shift distributions of terrestrial ecosystems on a global basis. Although such terrestrial changes may affect stream ecosystems, they have not been incorporated into predictions of stream responses to CC. Here, we introduce a conceptual framework to evaluate to what extent responses of streams to CC will be driven by not only changes in thermal and hydrologic regimes, but also alterations of terrestrial processes. We focused on forested watersheds of western North America because this region is projected to experience CC-induced alteration of terrestrial processes. This provided a backdrop for investigating interactive effects of climate and terrestrial responses on streams. Because stream responses to terrestrial processes have been well-studied in contexts largely independent of CC research, we synthesized this knowledge to demonstrate how CC-induced alterations of terrestrial ecosystems may affect streams. Our synthesis indicated that altered terrestrial processes will change terrestrial-aquatic linkages and autotrophic production, potentially yielding greater sensitivity of streams to CC than would be expected based on shifts in temperature and precipitation regime alone. Despite uncertainties that currently constrain predictions regarding stream responses to these additional pathways of change, this synthesis highlighted broader effects of CC that require additional research. Based on widespread evidence that CC is linked to changing terrestrial processes, we conclude that accurate predictions of CC effects on streams may be coupled to the accuracy of predictions for long-term changes in terrestrial ecosystems."
application of a land class hydrological model to climatic change,"Many climatologists predict major changes in the earth's climate due to an expected doubling of atmospheric greenhouse gases. Global circulation models have been used to derive alternate climate scenarios under such conditions and the effects on water resources have been estimated with hydrological models. The hydrological models have generally assumed that the watershed itself would remain unchanged. However, it is more likely that a changing climate would alter the distribution and the transpiration efficiency of vegetation types within a watershed. A new hydrological model in which the parameters are based on land use class (effectively vegetation type) was calibrated and verified for a watershed in the Rocky Mountains of British Columbia. The changes in land use associated with a doubled carbon dioxide scenario were estimated, and the model was rerun incorporating the changed climate and the changed land use. Details of the effects of this scenario on the hydrology of the watershed are given, but it is emphasized that the purpose of the paper is to develop the methodology and not to endorse any particular scenario of climatic change."
history of pacific northwest heat waves: synoptic pattern and trends,"A historical record of Pacific Northwest (defined here as west of the Cascade Mountains in Washington and Oregon) heat waves is identified using the U. S. Historical Climate Network, version 2, daily data (1901-2009). Both daytime and nighttime events are examined, defining a heat wave as three consecutive days above the 99th percentile for the maximum and minimum temperature anomalies separately. Although the synoptic characteristics of the daytime and nighttime heat events are similar, they do indicate some differences between the two types of events. Most notable is a stronger influence of downslope warming over the Cascade Mountains for the daytime events versus a more important role of precipitable water content for the nighttime events, presumably through its impact on downward longwave radiative fluxes. Current research suggests that the frequency and duration of heat waves are expected to increase in much of the United States, and analysis of the heat events reveals that a significant, increasing trend in the frequency of the nighttime events is already occurring in the Pacific Northwest. A heat wave occurred in 2009 that set all-time-record maximum temperatures in many locations and ranked as the second strongest daytime event and the longest nighttime event in the record."
novel genomic resources for a climate change sensitive mammal: characterization of the american pika transcriptome,"Background: When faced with climate change, species must either shift their home range or adapt in situ in order to maintain optimal physiological balance with their environment. The American pika (Ochotona princeps) is a small alpine mammal with limited dispersal capacity and low tolerance for thermal stress. As a result, pikas have become an important system for examining biotic responses to changing climatic conditions. Previous research using amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) has revealed evidence for environmental-mediated selection in O. princeps populations distributed along elevation gradients, yet the anonymity of AFLP loci and lack of available genomic resources precluded the identification of associated gene regions. Here, we harnessed next-generation sequencing technology in order to characterize the American pika transcriptome and identify a large suite of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which can be used to elucidate elevation-and site-specific patterns of sequence variation. Results: We constructed pooled cDNA libraries of O. princeps from high (1400m) and low (300m) elevation sites along a previously established transect in British Columbia. Transcriptome sequencing using the Roche 454 GS FLX titanium platform generated 780 million base pairs of data, which were assembled into 7,325 high coverage contigs. These contigs were used to identify 24,261 novel SNP loci. Using high resolution melt analysis, we developed 17 of these SNPs into genotyping assays, which were validated with independent DNA samples from British Columbia Canada and Oregon State USA. In addition, we detected haplotypes in the NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5 of the mitochondrial genome that were fixed and different among elevations, suggesting that this may be an informative target gene for studying the role of cellular respiration in local adaptation. We also identified contigs that were unique to each elevation, including a high elevation-specific contig that was a positive match with the hemoglobin alpha chain from the plateau pika, a species restricted to high elevation steppes in Asia. Elevation-specific contigs may represent candidate regions subject to differential levels of gene expression along this elevation gradient. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first broad-scale, transcriptome-level study conducted within the Ochotonidae, providing novel genomic resources for studying pika ecology, behaviour and population history."
characterizing the thermal suitability of instream habitat for salmonids: a cautionary example from the rocky mountains,"Understanding a species' thermal niche is becoming increasingly important for management and conservation within the context of global climate change, yet there have been surprisingly few efforts to compare assessments of a species' thermal niche across methods. To address this uncertainty, we evaluated the differences in model performance and interpretations of a species' thermal niche when using different measures of stream temperature and surrogates for stream temperature. Specifically, we used a logistic regression modeling framework with three different indicators of stream thermal conditions (elevation, air temperature, and stream temperature) referenced to a common set of Brook Trout Salvelinus fontinalis distribution data from the Boise River basin, Idaho. We hypothesized that stream temperature predictions that were contemporaneous with fish distribution data would have stronger predictive performance than composite measures of stream temperature or any surrogates for stream temperature. Across the different indicators of thermal conditions, the highest measure of accuracy was found for the model based on stream temperature predictions that were contemporaneous with fish distribution data (percent correctly classified = 71%). We found considerable differences in inferences across models, with up to 43% disagreement in the amount of stream habitat that was predicted to be suitable. The differences in performance between models support the growing efforts in many areas to develop accurate stream temperature models for investigations of species' thermal niches.

potential effects of climate change on streambed scour and risks to salmonid survival in snow-dominated mountain basins,"Snowmelt-dominated basins in northern latitudes provide critical habitat for salmonids. As such, these systems may be especially vulnerable to climate change because of potential shifts in the frequency, magnitude, and timing of flows that can scour incubating embryos. A general framework is presented to examine this issue, using a series of physical models that link climate change, streamflow, and channel morphology to predict the magnitude and spatial distribution of streambed scour and consequent risk to salmonid embryos at basin scales. The approach is demonstrated for a mountain catchment in the Northern Rocky Mountains, USA. Results show that risk of critical scour varies as a function of species and life history and is modulated by local variations in lithology and channel confinement. Embryos of smaller-bodied fall spawners may be at greater risk because of shallow egg burial depths and increased rain-on-snow events during their incubation period. Scour risk for all species is reduced when changes in channel morphology (width, depth, and grain size) keep pace with climate-driven changes in streamflow. Although climate change is predicted to increase scour magnitude, the frequency of scouring events relative to typical salmonid life cycles is relatively low, indicating that individual year classes may be impacted by critical scour, but extirpation of entire populations is not expected. Furthermore, refugia are predicted to occur in unconfined portions of the stream network, where scouring shear stresses are limited to bankfull stage because overbank flows spread across alluvial floodplains; conversely, confined valleys will likely exacerbate climate-driven changes in flow and scour. Our approach can be used to prioritize management strategies according to relative risk to different species or spatial distributions of risk and can be used to predict temporal shifts in the spatial distribution of suitable spawning habitats. A critical unknown issue is whether biological adaptation can keep pace with rates of climate change and channel response. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
oregon hydrologic landscapes: a classification framework,"Wigington, Parker J., Jr., Scott G. Leibowitz, Randy L. Comeleo, and Joseph L. Ebersole, 2012. Oregon Hydrologic Landscapes: A Classification Framework. Journal of the American Water Resources Association (JAWRA) 1-20. DOI: 10.1111/jawr.12009 Abstract: There is a growing need for hydrologic classification systems that can provide a basis for broad-scale assessments of the hydrologic functions of landscapes and watersheds and their responses to stressors such as climate change. We developed a hydrologic landscape (HL) classification approach that describes factors of climate-watershed systems that control the hydrologic characteristics of watersheds. Our assessment units are incremental watersheds (i.e., headwater watersheds or areas draining directly into stream reaches). Major components of the classification include indices of annual climate, climate seasonality, aquifer permeability, terrain, and soil permeability. To evaluate the usefulness of our approach, we identified 30 rivers with long-term streamflow-gauging records and without major diversions and impoundments. We used statistical clustering to group the streams based on the shapes of their annual hydrographs. Comparison of the streamflow clusters and HL distributions within river basin clusters shows that the Oregon HL approach has the ability to provide insights about the expected hydrologic behavior of HLs and larger river basins. The Oregon HL approach has potential to be a useful framework for comparing hydrologic attributes of streams and rivers in the Pacific Northwest."
"glacier change of the columbia icefield, canadian rocky mountains, 1919-2009","We determined length, area, elevation and volume change of the Columbia Icefield using Interprovincial Boundary Commission Survey maps from 1919, eight sets of aerial photographs from 1948 to 1993, and satellite data from 1999 to 2009. Over the period 1919-2009, glaciers on average retreated 1150 +/- 34 m and shrank by 2.4 +/- 0.2 km(2). Total area loss was 59.6 +/- 1.2 km(2) (23 +/- 5%), and mean elevation change was -49 +/- 25 m w.e., resulting in a total volume loss of 14.3 +/- 2.0 km(3) w.e. Large outlet glaciers experienced the greatest absolute ice loss, while small, detached glaciers lost the most relative length and area. Thinning rates of debris-covered ice were 30-60% lower than those for clean ice. All glacier changes were significantly correlated with each other (p < 0.01), with r values ranging from 0.54 to 0.82. Temperature is correlated with length and area change over periods lagged 1-5 years (p < 0.05), and with elevation and volume change over periods lagged 9-18 years (p < 0.05). Precipitation is correlated with glacier change over periods lagged 1-10 years (p < 0.05)."
climate and streamflow trends in the columbia river basin: evidence for ecological and engineering resilience to climate change,"Large river basins transfer the water signal from the atmosphere to the ocean. Climate change is widely expected to alter streamflow and potentially disrupt water management systems. We tested the ecological resilience-capacity of headwater ecosystems to sustain streamflow under climate change-and the engineering resilience-capacity of dam and reservoir management to overprint a climate change signal-in seven sub-basins of the Columbia River from 1950 to 2011. Sub-basins had a headwater gauge above dams with a long-term streamflow record and a nearby climate station with a long-term record of air temperature and precipitation, as well as matching long-term streamflow records at gauges downstream of dams. Trends were fitted to daily data for maximum and minimum temperature, precipitation, and streamflow over the period of record (mostly 1950-2011). Consistent with predicted streamflow response to climate warming, annual snowmelt runoff peaks in five of seven headwater basins shifted to a few days earlier over the period 1950 to 2010, but the changes were small, displaying ecological resilience. Below dams, streamflow change was attributable to reservoir operation for flood control (reduced annual peak flows) and irrigation (augmented late summer low flows), as well as flow management for hydropower, navigation, and recreation, but predicted streamflow responses to climate change were absent, indicating engineering resilience. Thus, to date, climate-warming effects on streamflow have been limited to headwaters, and flow regulation has obscured the expression of climate change on streamflow below dams in the Columbia River basin."
landscape-scale analysis of aboveground tree carbon stocks affected by mountain pine beetles in idaho,"Bark beetle outbreaks kill billions of trees in western North America, and the resulting tree mortality can significantly impact local and regional carbon cycling. However, substantial variability in mortality occurs within outbreak areas. Our objective was to quantify landscape-scale effects of beetle infestations on aboveground carbon (AGC) stocks using field observations and remotely sensed data across a 5054 ha study area that had experienced a mountain pine beetle outbreak. Tree mortality was classified using multispectral imagery that separated green, red, and gray trees, and models relating field observations of AGC to LiDAR data were used to map AGC. We combined mortality and AGC maps to quantify AGC in beetle-killed trees. Thirty-nine per cent of the forested area was killed by beetles, with large spatial variability in mortality severity. For the entire study area, 40-50% of AGC was contained in beetle-killed trees. When considered on a per-hectare basis, 75-89% of the study area had >25% AGC in killed trees and 3-6% of the study area had >75% of the AGC in killed trees. Our results show that despite high variability in tree mortality within an outbreak area, bark beetle epidemics can have a large impact on AGC stocks at the landscape scale."
"climatic, landform, microtopographic, and overstory canopy controls of tree invasion in a subalpine meadow landscape, oregon cascades, usa","Tree invasions have been documented throughout Northern Hemisphere high elevation meadows, as well as globally in many grass and forb-dominated ecosystems. Tree invasions are often associated with large-scale changes in climate or disturbance regimes, but are fundamentally driven by regeneration processes influenced by interactions between climatic, topographic, and biotic factors at multiple spatial scales. The purpose of this research was to quantify spatiotemporal patterns of meadow invasion; and how climate, larger landforms, topography, and overstory trees have interactively influenced tree invasion. We combined airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) characterizations of landforms, topography, and overstory vegetation with historical climate, field measurements of snow depth, tree abundance, and tree ages to reconstruct spatial and temporal patterns of tree invasion over five decades in a subalpine meadow complex in the Oregon Cascade Range, USA. Proportion of meadow occupied by trees increased from 8 % in 1950 to 35 % in 2007. Larger landforms, topography, and tree canopies interactively mediated regional climatic controls of tree invasion by modifying depth and persistence of snow pack, while tree canopies also influenced seed source availability. Landscape context played an important role mediating snow depth and tree invasion; on glacial landforms tree invasion was negatively associated with spring snowfall, but on debris flows tree invasion was not associated with snow fall. The importance of snow, uncertain climate change impacts on snow, and mediation of snow by interacting and context dependent factors in complex mountain terrain poses substantial hurdles for understanding how these ecotones may respond to future climate conditions."
"perspectives on climate change, mountain hydrology, and water resources in the oregon cascades, usa","From both social and environmental perspectives, water is the main connection between highland and lowland processes in mountain watersheds: Water flows downhill while human impacts flow uphill. For example, in the Oregon Cascades mountain range, geology, vegetation, and climate influence the hydrologic connections within watersheds. Geology determines which watersheds are surface runoff-dominated and which are groundwater-dominated. In this Mediterranean climate with dry summers, surface runoff watersheds will consistently experience near-zero late summer discharge, so declining snowpacks will have little effect on low flows. This contrasts with groundwater-dominated watersheds, where a shift from snow to rain or a decline in precipitation will reduce recharge, thereby reducing late summer groundwater contributions to streamflow. Earlier snowmelt causes forests to transpire earlier, resulting in decreased springtime streamflow. Reduced snowpacks lead to soil moisture stress, making forests more vulnerable to extensive wildfires and affecting the lifespan and composition of forests. Monitoring and quantifying these complex linkages and feedbacks require appropriate measurement networks. Sampling strategies often use watershed typology to identify where measurements should be focused. Such an approach should include not only established watershed classification parameters such as topology and geology but also interannual climate variability and land cover. As concerns of water scarcity and vulnerability move to the forefront, our watershed classifications should be extended to include ecosystem and social-ecological parameters. An integrated and agent-based modeling scheme called Envision has been developed to simulate alternative future landscapes at the watershed scale. Using fully coupled models of hydrology, ecosystems, and socioeconomics, decision-makers can simulate the effects of policy decisions in conjunction with other climate forcing, land use change, and economic disturbances. To understand the combined impacts of climate change and humans on water in mountain watersheds, researchers must develop integrated monitoring and modeling systems that explicitly include connections across eco-hydrologic and social-ecological systems."
"relative impact of anthropogenic modifications versus climate change on the natural flow regimes of rivers in the northern rocky mountains, united states","We studied discharge data from stream gauges located in natural and anthropogenically modified river basins of the Northern Rocky Mountains over 59 years. We applied linear and nonlinear models to the data to determine what, if any, alterations have occurred in the annual flow regimes. By comparing the different results from the natural and anthropogenically modified river basins, we were able to distinguish the impacts that climate change and anthropogenic modifications have had on flow regimes in the Northern Rocky Mountains over the period of record. We found that regional climate change has not significantly altered the natural flow regimes. However, we did find an underlying cyclical pattern in the total amount of annual discharge in both the natural and anthropogenically modified river basins. This suggests a strong link between the quantity of runoff and some kind of hydroclimatologic cycle. Conversely, direct basin anthropogenic modifications such as damming, irrigation, and urbanization have caused a decrease in the difference between the minimum and maximum annual discharges and a decrease in the daily variations of flows across the Northern Rocky Mountains. In general, direct anthropogenic modifications of the river basins have altered the flow regimes to a much greater extent than climate change."
modeling interannual variability in snow-cover development and melt for a semiarid mountain catchment,"Observed changes in midelevation snow cover and duration have raised concerns over future impacts of global warming on snowmelt-dependent water resources and ecosystems. However, predictions of future changes in snow hydrology and water supply from mountain basins are complicated by natural variability in climate and interactions among topography, vegetation structure, wind and radiation energy, and snow deposition. In this study, interannual variability in snow-cover development, snow melt, and runoff is assessed for a range of precipitation and temperature conditions typical of a mountain catchment, the Reynolds Mountain East (RME) basin, in Idaho. A spatially distributed energy and mass balance snow model, Isnobal, coupled with a windfield and snow redistribution model, is used to continuously simulate snow accumulation and melt for five individual snow seasons (1984, 1986, 1987, 2001, and 2006), representing the historic range of climatic variance. The modeling results compare well with the field measurements of snow water equivalent for all simulation snow seasons (Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient of 0.81 to 0.97). The modeling scheme used in this study demonstrates spatial and temporal differences in snow-cover development and melt processes in complex mountain terrain. During all simulation snow seasons, the forested site was shown to hold more snow, generate more snowmelt, and melt later than the exposed site of the basin. Comparison of simulation results for wet and dry snow seasons showed that the snow melts earlier and a greater fraction of surface water input (SWI) is utilized to fill soil water storage during dry seasons than in wet snow seasons. This study demonstrates differences in snowmelt volume and timing during wet and dry seasons within a mountain basin. It will improve understanding of how interannual variability affects the delivery of water from the seasonal snowcover to the soil and streams of mountain basins, and can provide useful inputs to the decision-making process for reservoir and water management strategies for utilizing surplus or supplementing deficit water supplies during wet and dry years, respectively.

small soil storage capacity limits benefit of winter snowpack to upland vegetation,"In the western United States, the mountain snowpack is an important natural reservoir that extends spring and summer water delivery to downstream users and ecosystems. The importance of winter snow accumulation to upland ecosystems is not as clearly defined. This study investigates the relative contribution of winter precipitation to upland spring and summer soil moisture storage and availability in a semi-arid mountainous watershed. At this site, coarse soil textures and shallow soil depths limit soil storage capacity to 616?cm. Winter precipitation exceeds soil storage capacity by 2.5 times. Accordingly, soil moisture profiles at most locations in the watershed reach field capacity in early winter. With soil storage near capacity, water released by snowmelt primarily contributes to deep drainage and makes a limited contribution to the soil moisture reservoir. Water that is retained by the soil after the snowpack melts is lost to evapotranspiration in as little as 10?days. In contrast, spring precipitation extends moist soil conditions by up to 90?days into the warm season, when ecological water demand is highest. These field observations suggest that changes in spring precipitation, not winter snowpack, may have the greater impact on upland ecosystems in this environment. Furthermore, because winter precipitation is in excess compared to the soil storage capacity, soil moisture availability may be fairly insensitive to climate change-induced transitions from snow to rain.

"estimates of future flow, including extremes, of the columbia river headwaters","Streamflow projections, including extremes, for the 2050s for the Columbia River headwaters above Donald are obtained by downscaling four regional climate models of the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP) suite and subsequent driving of a hydrologic model. We employ the entire model chain from global and regional climate models, station-based statistical downscaling, and a fully distributed, physically based hydrologic model and verify the results against observed streamflow. The performance is model dependent but is generally encouraging enough to justify the application of the climate scenarios. A general warming of about 2 degrees C is projected and, on average, slightly drier conditions, especially in late summer. We find evidence that the projected changes are elevation dependent and relatively small scale, with decreasing signals with higher elevations. All models project a shift of the hydrograph toward a more rain-fed regime, with peak flows occurring in June instead of July. Annual peak flow is projected to not increase, and August low flow decreases in all four models. With nonshrinking (static) glaciers, relatively high melting rates are simulated for August and September that partly compensate for the shifted hydrograph; this enhanced glacier melt is also detected in simulated historic Columbia headwater flow. The static approximation is supported by a heuristic seasonal sensitivity analysis that suggests a moderate average areal glacier recession of about 10% for the midcentury. We discuss the need for a dynamic glacier component for a refined assessment of future drought risk."
changes in spring snowpack for selected basins in the united states for different climate-change scenarios,"Spring snowpack is an important water resource in many river basins in the United States in areas where snowmelt comprises a large part of the annual runoff. Increasing temperatures will likely reduce snowpacks in the future, resulting in more winter runoff and less available water during the summer low-flow season. As part of the National Climate Change Modeling Project by the U.S. Geological Survey, distributed watershed-model output was analyzed to characterize areal extent and water-equivalent volumes of spring snowpack for a warming climate. The output from seven selected watershed models from the mountainous western United States and one model from coastal Maine in the northeastern United States shows a future of declining spring snowpack. Snow-cover area (SCA) and snow-water equivalent (SWE) were used to compare the spring snowpack for current conditions (2006) with three time periods in the future (2030, 2060, and 2090) using three Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) emission scenarios published in the 2007 Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES): A2, B1, and A1B. Distributed SWE and SCA values were sorted into elevation zones in each basin. The change in spring snowpack over time was greater than the change among different emission scenarios, suggesting that, even for a globally reduced carbon emission scenario, large decreases in SWE are likely to occur. The SRES A2 scenario resulted in the greatest decrease in SWE for six of the basins, and the SRES B1 and A1B scenarios resulted in the greatest decrease in one basin each."
"climate determines upper, but not lower, altitudinal range limits of pacific northwest conifers","Does climate determine species' ranges? Rapid rates of anthropogenic warming make this classic ecological question especially relevant. We ask whether climate controls range limits by quantifying relationships between climatic variables (precipitation, temperature) and tree growth across the altitudinal ranges of six Pacific Northwestern conifers on Mt. Rainier, Washington, USA. Results for three species (Abies amabilis, Callitropsis nootkatensis, Tsuga mertensiana) whose upper limits occur at treeline (>1600 m) imply climatic controls on upper range limits, with low growth in cold and high snowpack years. Annual growth was synchronized among individuals at upper limits for these high-elevation species, further suggesting that stand-level effects such as climate constrain growth more strongly than local processes. By contrast, at lower limits climatic effects on growth were weak for these high-elevation species. Growth-climate relationships for three low-elevation species (Pseudotsuga menziesii, Thuja plicata, Tsuga heterophylla) were not consistent with expectations of climatic controls on upper limits, which are located within closed-canopy forest (<1200 m). Annual growth of these species was poorly synchronized among individuals. Our results suggest that climate controls altitudinal range limits at treeline, while local drivers (perhaps biotic interactions) influence growth in closed-canopy forests. Climate-change-induced range shifts in closed-canopy forests will therefore be difficult to predict accurately."
"influences of the biophysical environment on blister rust and mountain pine beetle, and their interactions, in whitebark pine forests","Aim To understand how the biophysical environment influences patterns of infection by non-native blister rust (caused by Cronartium ribicola) and mortality caused by native mountain pine beetles (Dendroctonus ponderosae) in whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis) communities, to determine how these disturbances interact, and to gain insight into how climate change may influence these patterns in the future. Location High-elevation forests in south-west Montana, central Idaho, eastern and western Oregon, USA. Methods Stand inventory and dendroecological methods were used to assess stand structure and composition and to reconstruct forest history at sixty 0.1-ha plots. Patterns of blister rust infection and mountain pine beetle-caused mortality in whitebark pine trees were examined using nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA, Mann-Whitney U-tests, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov two-sample tests. Stepwise regression was used to build models of blister rust infection and mountain pine beetle-related mortality rates based on a suite of biophysical site variables. Results Occurrence of blister rust infections was significantly different among the mountain ranges, with a general gradient of decreasing blister rust occurrence from east to west. Evidence of mountain pine beetle-caused mortality was identified on 83% of all dead whitebark pine trees and was relatively homogenous across the study area. Blister rust infected trees of all ages and sizes uniformly, while mountain pine beetles infested older, larger trees at all sites. Stepwise regressions explained 64% and 58% of the variance in blister rust infection and beetle-caused mortality, respectively, indicating that these processes are strongly influenced by the biophysical environment. More open stand structures produced by beetle outbreaks may increase the exposure of surviving whitebark pine trees to blister rust infection. Main conclusions Variability in the patterns of blister rust infection and mountain pine beetle-caused mortality elucidated the fundamental dynamics of these disturbance agents and suggests that the effects of climate change will be complex in whitebark pine communities and vary across the species' range. Interactions between blister rust and beetle outbreaks may accelerate declines or facilitate the rise of rust resistance in whitebark pine depending on forest conditions at the time of the outbreak."
modeling the effects of developmental variation on insect phenology,"Phenology, the timing of developmental events such as oviposition or pupation, is highly dependent on temperature; since insects are ectotherms, the time it takes them to complete a life stage (development time) depends on the temperatures they experience. This dependence varies within and between populations due to variation among individuals that is fixed within a life stage (giving rise to what we call persistent variation) and variation from random effects within a life stage (giving rise to what we call random variation). It is important to understand how both types of variation affect phenology if we are to predict the effects of climate change on insect populations. We present three nested phenology models incorporating increasing levels of variation. First, we derive an advection equation to describe the temperature-dependent development of a population with no variation in development time. This model is extended to incorporate persistent variation by introducing a developmental phenotype that varies within a population, yielding a phenotype-dependent advection equation. This is further extended by including a diffusion term describing random variation in a phenotype-dependent Fokker-Planck development equation. These models are also novel because they are formulated in terms of development time rather than developmental rate; development time can be measured directly in the laboratory, whereas developmental rate is calculated by transforming laboratory data. We fit the phenology models to development time data for mountain pine beetles (MPB) (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins [Coleoptera: Scolytidae]) held at constant temperatures in laboratory experiments. The nested models are parameterized using a maximum likelihood approach. The results of the parameterization show that the phenotype-dependent advection model provides the best fit to laboratory data, suggesting that MPB phenology may be adequately described in terms of persistent variation alone. MPB phenology is simulated using phloem temperatures and attack time distributions measured in central Idaho. The resulting emergence time distributions compare favorably to field observations."
effects of climate change and wildfire on stream temperatures and salmonid thermal habitat in a mountain river network,"Mountain streams provide important habitats for many species, but their faunas are especially vulnerable to climate change because of ectothermic physiologies and movements that are constrained to linear networks that are easily fragmented. Effectively conserving biodiversity in these systems requires accurate downscaling of climatic trends to local habitat conditions, but downscaling is difficult in complex terrains given diverse microclimates and mediation of stream heat budgets by local conditions. We compiled a stream temperature database (n = 780) for a 2500-km river network in central Idaho to assess possible trends in summer temperatures and thermal habitat for two native salmonid species from 1993 to 2006. New spatial statistical models that account for network topology were parameterized with these data and explained 93% and 86% of the variation in mean stream temperatures and maximas, respectively. During our study period, basin average mean stream temperatures increased by 0.38 degrees C (0.27 degrees C/decade), and maximas increased by 0.48 degrees C (0.34 degrees C/decade), primarily due to long-term (30-50 year) trends in air temperatures and stream flows. Radiation increases from wildfires accounted for 9% of basin-scale temperature increases, despite burning 14% of the basin. Within wildfire perimeters, however, stream temperature increases were 2-3 times greater than basin averages, and radiation gains accounted for 50% of warming. Thermal habitat for rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) was minimally affected by temperature increases, except for small shifts towards higher elevations. Bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus), in contrast, were estimated to have lost 11-20% (8-16%/decade) of the headwater stream lengths that were cold enough for spawning and early juvenile rearing, with the largest losses occurring in the coldest habitats. Our results suggest that a warming climate has begun to affect thermal conditions in streams and that impacts to biota will be specific to both species and context. Where species are at risk, conservation actions should be guided based on considerations of restoration opportunity and future climatic effects. To refine predictions based on thermal effects, more work is needed to understand mechanisms associated with biological responses, climate effects on other habitat features, and habitat configurations that confer population resilience."
on glacier retreat and drought cycles in the rocky mountains of montana and canada,"The enigma of why mountain glacier started to retreat in the 1850s in the Rocky Mountains and elsewhere remains unresolved. The most important factor affecting climate change presumably was a change in the mode of operation of the sun one or two decades earlier (from irregular periodicity and low output to regular periods and greater brightness). But the direct cause appears to have been the onset of drought in the 1830s. Interestingly, there is no obvious solar information in the drought narrative in Montana and southwestern Canada. The presence of tidal lines in the spectrum of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, together with the presence of lines that could be interpreted as beat periods between solar and tidal forcing in the drought series, suggests that the energy of solar variation is preempted for interference with tidal forcing, within the system of oscillations informing precipitation patterns in the region. The suggestion is supported by the presence of a strikingly dominant 12.5-year period in the drought series, which is interpreted as a difference tone between the main sunspot cycle (at 10.8) and a tidal period at 5.8.

optimized flood control in the columbia river basin for a global warming scenario,"Anticipated future temperature changes in the mountainous U. S. Pacific Northwest will cause reduced spring snow pack, earlier melt, earlier spring peak flow and lower summer flow in transient rain-snow and snowmelt dominant river basins. In the context of managed flood control, these systematic changes are likely to disrupt the balance between flood control and reservoir refill in existing reservoir systems. To adapt to these hydrologic changes, refill timing and evacuation requirements for flood control need to be modified. This work poses a significant systems engineering problem, especially for large, multiobjective water systems. An existing optimization/simulation procedure is refined for rebalancing flood control and refill objectives for the Columbia River Basin for anticipated global warming. To calibrate the optimization model for the 20th century flow, the objective function is tuned to reproduce the current reliability of reservoir refill, while providing comparable levels of flood control to those produced by current flood control practices. After the optimization model is calibrated using the 20th century flow the same objective function is used to develop flood control curves for a global warming scenario which assumes an approximately 2 C increase in air temperature. Robust decreases in system storage deficits are simulated for the climate change scenario when optimized flood rule curves replace the current flood control curves, without increasing monthly flood risks."
"genetic architecture and phenotypic plasticity of thermally-regulated traits in an eruptive species, dendroctonus ponderosae","Phenotypic plasticity in thermally-regulated traits enables close tracking of changing environmental conditions, and can thereby enhance the potential for rapid population increase, a hallmark of outbreak insect species. In a changing climate, exposure to conditions that exceed the capacity of existing phenotypic plasticity may occur.

modeling tamarisk (tamarix spp) habitat and climate change effects in the northwestern united states,"Tamarisk species are shrubs or small trees considered by some to be among the most aggressively invasive and potentially detrimental exotic plants in the United States. Although extensively studied in the southern and interior west, northwestern (Oregon, Washington, and Idaho) distribution and habitat information for tamarisk is either limited or lacking. We obtained distribution data for the northwest, developed a habitat suitability map, and projected changes in habitat due to climate change in a smaller case study area using downscaled climate data. Results show extensive populations of tamarisk east of the Cascade Mountains. Despite the perceived novelty of tamarisk in the region, naturalized populations were present by the 1920s. Major population centers are limited to the warmest and driest environments in the central Snake River Plain, Columbia Plateau, and Northern Basin and Range. Habitat suitability model results indicate that 21% of the region supports suitable tamarisk habitat. Less than 1% of these areas are occupied by tamarisk; the remainder is highly vulnerable to invasion. Although considerable uncertainty exists regarding future climate change, we project a 2- to 10-fold increase in highly suitable tamarisk habitat by the end of the century. Our habitat suitability maps can be used in ""what if"" exercises as part of planning, detection, restoration, management, and eradication purposes."
mountain pine beetle and forest carbon feedback to climate change,"The mountain pine beetle ( Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins, Coleoptera: Curculionidae, Scolytinae) is a native insect of the pine forests of western North America, and its populations periodically erupt into large- scale outbreaks(1-3). During outbreaks, the resulting widespread tree mortality reduces forest carbon uptake and increases future emissions from the decay of killed trees. The impacts of insects on forest carbon dynamics, however, are generally ignored in large- scale modelling analyses. The current outbreak in British Columbia, Canada, is an order of magnitude larger in area and severity than all previous recorded outbreaks(4). Here we estimate that the cumulative impact of the beetle outbreak in the affected region during 2000 - 2020 will be 270 megatonnes ( Mt) carbon ( or 36 g carbon m(-2) yr(-1) on average over 374,000 km 2 of forest). This impact converted the forest from a small net carbon sink to a large net carbon source both during and immediately after the outbreak. In the worst year, the impacts resulting from the beetle outbreak in British Columbia were equivalent to similar to 75% of the average annual direct forest fire emissions from all of Canada during 1959 - 1999. The resulting reduction in net primary production was of similar magnitude to increases observed during the 1980s and 1990s as a result of global change(5). Climate change has contributed to the unprecedented extent and severity of this outbreak(6). Insect outbreaks such as this represent an important mechanism by which climate change may undermine the ability of northern forests to take up and store atmospheric carbon, and such impacts should be accounted for in large- scale modelling analyses."
anticipated climate warming effects on bull trout habitats and populations across the interior columbia river basin,"A warming climate could profoundly affect the distribution and abundance of many fishes. Bull trout Salvelinus confluentus may be especially vulnerable to climate change given that spawning and early rearing are constrained by cold water temperatures creating a patchwork of natal headwater habitats across river networks. Because the size and connectivity of patches also appear to influence the persistence of local populations, climate warming could lead to increasing fragmentation of remaining habitats and accelerated decline of this species. We modeled the relationships between (1) the lower elevation limits of small bull trout and mean annual air temperature and (2) latitude and longitude across the species' potential range within the interior Columbia River basin of the USA. We used our results to explore the implications of the climate warming expected in the next 50 or more years. We found a strong association between the lower elevation limits of bull trout distributions and longitude and latitude; this association was consistent with the patterns in mean annual air temperature. We concluded that climate does strongly influence regional and local bull trout distributions, and we estimated bull trout habitat response to a range of predicted climate warming effects. Warming over the range predicted could result in losses of 18-92% of thermally suitable natal habitat area and 27-99% of large (>10,000-ha) habitat patches, which suggests that population impacts may be disproportionate to the simple loss of habitat area. The predicted changes were not uniform across the species' range, and some populations appear to face higher risks than others. These results could provide a foundation for regional prioritization in conservation management, although more detailed models are needed to prioritize actions at local scales."
mountain hydrology of the western united states,"[ 1] Climate change and climate variability, population growth, and land use change drive the need for new hydrologic knowledge and understanding. In the mountainous West and other similar areas worldwide, three pressing hydrologic needs stand out: first, to better understand the processes controlling the partitioning of energy and water fluxes within and out from these systems; second, to better understand feedbacks between hydrological fluxes and biogeochemical and ecological processes; and, third, to enhance our physical and empirical understanding with integrated measurement strategies and information systems. We envision an integrative approach to monitoring, modeling, and sensing the mountain environment that will improve understanding and prediction of hydrologic fluxes and processes. Here extensive monitoring of energy fluxes and hydrologic states are needed to supplement existing measurements, which are largely limited to streamflow and snow water equivalent. Ground-based observing systems must be explicitly designed for integration with remotely sensed data and for scaling up to basins and whole ranges."
flow regime alterations under changing climate in two river basins: implications for freshwater ecosystems,"We examined impacts of future climate scenarios on flow regimes and how predicted changes might affect river ecosystems. We examined two case studies: Cle Elum River, Washington, and Chattahoochee-Apalachicola River Basin, Georgia and Florida. These rivers had available downscaled global circulation model (GCM) data and allowed us to analyse the effects of future climate scenarios on rivers with (1) different hydrographs, (2) high future water demands, and (3) a river-floodplain system. We compared observed flow regimes to those predicted under future climate scenarios to describe the extent and type of changes predicted to occur. Daily stream flow under future climate scenarios was created by either statistically downscaling GCMs (Cle Elum) or creating a regression model between climatological parameters predicted from GCMs and stream flow (Chattahoochee-Apalachicola). Flow regimes were examined for changes from current conditions with respect to ecologically relevant features including the magnitude and timing of minimum and maximum flows. The Cie Elum's hydrograph under future climate scenarios showed a dramatic shift in the timing of peak flows and lower low flow of a longer duration. These changes could mean higher summer water temperatures, lower summer dissolved oxygen, and reduced survival of larval fishes. The Chattahoochee-Apalachicola basin is heavily impacted by dams and water withdrawals for human consumption; therefore, we made comparisons between pre-large dam conditions, current conditions, current conditions with future demand, and future climate scenarios with future demand to separate climate change effects and other anthropogenic impacts. Dam construction, future climate, and future demand decreased the flow variability of the river. In addition, minimum flows were lower under future climate scenarios. These changes could decrease the connectivity of the channel and the floodplain, decrease habitat availability, and potentially lower the ability of the river to assimilate wastewater treatment plant effluent. Our study illustrates the types of changes that river ecosystems might experience under future climates. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
declining mountain snowpack in western north america,"In western North America, snow provides crucial storage of winter precipitation, effectively transferring water from the relatively wet winter season to the typically dry summers. Manual and telemetered. measurements of spring snowpack, corroborated by a physically based hydrologic model, are examined here for climate-driven fluctuations and trends during the period of 1916-2002. Much of the mountain West has experienced declines in spring snowpack, especially since midcentury, despite increases in winter precipitation in many places. Analysis and modeling show that climatic trends are the dominant factor, not changes in land use, forest canopy, or other factors. The largest decreases have occurred where winter temperatures are mild, especially in the Cascade Mountains and northern California. In most mountain ranges, relative declines grow from minimal at ridgetop to substantial at snow line. Taken together, these results emphasize that the West's snow resources are already declining as earth's climate warms."
fire-induced erosion and millennialscale climate change in northern ponderosa pine forests,"Western US ponderosa pine forests have recently suffered extensive stand-replacing fires followed by hillslope erosion and sedimentation(1-4). These fires are usually attributed to increased stand density as a result of fire suppression, grazing and other land use, and are often considered uncharacteristic or unprecedented(1-3). Tree-ring records from the past 500 years indicate that before Euro-American settlement, frequent, low-severity fires maintained open stands(1-3). However, the pre-settlement period between about AD 1500 and AD 1900 was also generally colder than present(5-10), raising the possibility that rapid twentieth-century warming promoted recent catastrophic fires. Here we date fire-related sediment deposits in alluvial fans in central Idaho to reconstruct Holocene fire history in xeric ponderosa pine forests and examine links to climate. We find that colder periods experienced frequent low-severity fires, probably fuelled by increased understory growth. Warmer periods experienced severe droughts, stand-replacing fires and large debris-flow events that comprise a large component of long-term erosion(11) and coincide with similar events in sub-alpine forests of Yellowstone National Park(12). Our results suggest that given the powerful influence of climate, restoration of processes typical of pre-settlement times may be difficult in a warmer future that promotes severe fires."
"climate change impacts on water management and irrigated agriculture in the yakima river basin, washington, usa","The Yakima River Reservoir system supplies water to ���������180,000 irrigated hectares through the operation of five reservoirs with cumulative storage of ���������30% mean annual river flow. Runoff is derived mostly from winter precipitation in the Cascade Mountains, much of which is stored as snowpack. Climate change is expected to result in earlier snowmelt runoff and reduced summer flows. Effects of these changes on irrigated agriculture were simulated using a reservoir system model coupled to a hydrological model driven by downscaled scenarios from 20 climate models archived by the 2007 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report. We find earlier snowmelt results in increased water delivery curtailments. Historically, the basin experienced substantial water shortages in 14% of years. Without adaptations, for IPCC A1B global emission scenarios, water shortages increase to 27% (13% to 49% range) in the 2020s, to 33% in the 2040s, and 68% in the 2080s. For IPCC B1 emissions scenarios, shortages occur in 24% (7% to 54%) of years in the 2020s, 31% in the 2040s and 43% in the 2080s. Historically unprecedented conditions where senior water rights holders suffer shortfalls occur with increasing frequency in both A1B and B1 scenarios. Economic losses include expected annual production declines of 5%-16%, with greater probabilities of operating losses for junior water rights holders."
characteristics of the western united states snowpack from snowpack telemetry (snotel) data,"Daily station data from U.S. Department of Agriculture snowpack telemetry (SNOTEL) archives through the 1995/1996 season are used to examine the climatic characteristics of snow water equivalent (SWE) for the mountainous western United States and linkages with precipitation (PRE) and temperature. Quality control procedures were developed to screen outliers in each variable. SWE for April 1 at the SNOTEL sites compares favorably with colocated snow course values. Regional differences in the seasonal cycle of SWE are discussed in terms of winter-half precipitation, temperature, and the corresponding SWE/PRE ratio. The percentage of annual precipitation represented by snowfall is highest for the Sierra Nevada (67%), northwestern Wyoming (64%), Colorado (63%), and Idaho/western Montana (62%) sectors, manifesting high SWE/PRE ratios and winter-half precipitation maxima. Lower percentages for the Pacific Northwest (50%) and Arizona/New Mexico (39%) reflect lower ratios and, especially for the latter region, a larger fraction of PRE falling outside of the accumulation season. Interannual variability in SWE in the colder inland regions is primarily controlled by available precipitation. For the warmer Pacific coast regions and Arizona/New Mexico the more important factor is the SWE/PRE ratio, illustrating the sensitivity of these areas to climate change."
"carbon implications of current and future effects of drought, fire and management on pacific northwest forests","Climate change has already begun to impact the structure and function of forest ecosystems in the Pacific Northwest by altering the frequency, intensity, and duration of droughts and heat stress, with implications for widespread environmental and socio-economic change. A major realization is that accumulated physiological stress can ultimately lead to tree mortality and changes in species distributions, particularly in areas away from maritime influences. To ameliorate the effects of drought, insect outbreaks, and reduce the risk of crown fires, various strategies are being tested. To make some of these strategies economical, biomass is proposed as an alternative energy source. At the same time that an increase in harvesting is being considered, there is a desire to increase carbon sequestration by forests to offset, at least in part, greenhouse gas emissions. Assessments are needed to determine current and future impacts of climate change, and to evaluate management options while considering carbon storage benefits and sustainability of ecosystem structure and function. Here we provide an overview of research results from the Pacific Northwest region where forests dominate the landscape and contain among the highest biomass on earth. In this review, we present findings that challenge common assumptions, and suggest a way to predict outcomes of changes in climate and land management in the future. The approach includes the use of observation-driven land system models that integrate the extent that forests are vulnerable to climate change, management practices, and economic considerations. It also requires increased emphasis on in situ and remotely sensed observations and experiments to initialize and test the model, and to track trends in forest condition. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

projected future vegetation changes for the northwest united states and southwest canada at a fine spatial resolution using a dynamic global vegetation model,"Future climate change may significantly alter the distributions of many plant taxa. The effects of climate change may be particularly large in mountainous regions where climate can vary significantly with elevation. Understanding potential future vegetation changes in these regions requires methods that can resolve vegetation responses to climate change at fine spatial resolutions. We used LPJ, a dynamic global vegetation model, to assess potential future vegetation changes for a large topographically complex area of the northwest United States and southwest Canada (38.0-58.0 degrees N latitude by 136.6-103.0 degrees W longitude). LPJ is a process-based vegetation model that mechanistically simulates the effect of changing climate and atmospheric CO2 concentrations on vegetation. It was developed and has been mostly applied at spatial resolutions of 10-minutes or coarser. In this study, we used LPJ at a 30-second (similar to 1-km) spatial resolution to simulate potential vegetation changes for 2070-2099. LPJ was run using downscaled future climate simulations from five coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (CCSM3, CGCM3.1(T47), GISS-ER, MIROC3.2(medres), UKMO-HadCM3) produced using the A2 greenhouse gases emissions scenario. Under projected future climate and atmospheric CO2 concentrations, the simulated vegetation changes result in the contraction of alpine, shrub-steppe, and xeric shrub vegetation across the study area and the expansion of woodland and forest vegetation. Large areas of maritime cool forest and cold forest are simulated to persist under projected future conditions. The fine spatial-scale vegetation simulations resolve patterns of vegetation change that are not visible at coarser resolutions and these fine-scale patterns are particularly important for understanding potential future vegetation changes in topographically complex areas."
sensitivity of soil water availability to changing snowmelt timing in the western us,"The ecohydrological effects of changing snowmelt are strongly mediated by soil moisture. We utilize 259 Snow Telemetry stations across the western U.S. to address two questions: (1) how do relationships between peak soil moisture (PSM) timing and the day of snow disappearance (DSD) vary across ecoregions and (2) what is the regional sensitivity of PSM timing to earlier DSD associated with warming and drying scenarios? All western U.S. ecoregions showed significant relationships between the timing of PSM and DSD. Changes in the timing of PSM based on warming predicted for the middle and end of the 21st century ranged from 1 to 9days and from 6 to 17days among ecoregions, respectively. The maritime ecoregions PSM timing were 2-3 times more sensitive to warming and drying versus the interior mountain ecoregions. This work suggests that soil hydrology modifies the effects of earlier snowmelt on regional streamflow response and vegetation water stress."
snow cover variability in a forest ecotone of the oregon cascades via modis terra products,"Snow cover pattern and persistence have important implications for planetary energy balance, climate sensitivity to forcings, and vegetation structure, function, and composition. Variability in snow cover within mountainous regions of the Pacific Northwest, USA is attributable to a combination of anthropogenic climate change and climate oscillations. However, snow covered areas can be heterogeneous and patchy, requiring more detailed mapping of snow trends to understand their potential influences on montane forests. We used standard daily MODIS snow products (MOD10A1.5) to investigate the 15-year record (2000-2014) of snow cover in the predominant forest ecotone of the Oregon Western Cascades. We modeled the ecotone using field data from the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest, and only considered forested MODIS Terra pixels located within the mapped ecotone of a five-county region. Three snow cover metrics were developed using both binary and fractional snow cover data: mean ecotone snow cover percent, number of snow covered days during the melt season, and day of snow disappearance. Snow cover and depletion dates exhibited large interannual variability and no significant linear trends. This variability is likely influenced by the preceding wintertime states of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the El Nino/Southem Oscillation (ENSO), which tend to covary. We improve and generalize existing methods for power analysis of trend estimation and quantify the number of uninterrupted observations of the snow metrics that would be needed to distinguish trends of different magnitudes from noise variance, taking possible autocorrelation into account. Sensitivity analyses of the results to some of our heuristic choices are conducted, and challenges associated with optical remote sensing of snow in a dense montane forest are discussed.

"epiphytic macrolichen indication of air quality and climate in interior forested mountains of the pacific northwest, usa","Biomonitoring can provide cost-effective and practical information about the distribution of nitrogen (N) deposition, particularly in regions with complex topography and sparse instrumented monitoring sites. Because of their unique biology, lichens are very sensitive bioindicators of air quality. Lichens lack a cuticle to control absorption or leaching of nutrients and they dynamically concentrate nutrients roughly in proportion to the abundance in the atmosphere. As N deposition increases, nitrogen-loving eutrophic lichens become dominant over oligotrophic lichens that thrive in nutrient-poor habitats. We capitalize on these characteristics to develop two lichen-based indicators of air-borne and depositional N for interior forested mountain ecosystems of the Pacific Northwest and calibrate them with N concentration measured in PM2.5 at 12 IMPROVE air quality monitoring sites in the study area. The two lichen indices and peak frequencies of individual species exhibited continuous relationships with inorganic N pollution throughout the range of N in ambient PM2.5, suggesting that the designation of a critical level or critical load is somewhat arbitrary because at any level above background, some species are likely to experience adverse impacts. The concentration of N in PM2.5 near the city of Spokane, Washington was the lowest measured at an instrumented monitoring site near known N pollution sources. This level, 0.37 mu g/m(3)/year, served as a critical level, corresponding to a concentration of 1.02% N in the lichen Letharia vulpina, which is similar to the upper end of background lichen N concentrations measured elsewhere in the western United States. Based on this level, we estimate critical loads to be 1.54 and 2.51 kg/ha/year of through-fall dissolved inorganic N deposition for lichen communities and lichen N concentration, respectively. We map estimated fine-particulate (PM2.5) N in ambient air based on lichen community and lichen N concentration indices to identify hotspots in the region. We also develop and map an independent lichen community-based bioclimatic index, which is strongly related to gradients in moisture availability and temperature variability. Lichen communities in the driest climates were more eutrophic than those in wetter climates at the same levels of N air pollution. Published by Elsevier Ltd."
mountain landscapes offer few opportunities for high-elevation tree species migration,"Climate change is anticipated to alter plant species distributions. Regional context, notably the spatial complexity of climatic gradients, may influence species migration potential. While high-elevation species may benefit from steep climate gradients in mountain regions, their persistence may be threatened by limited suitable habitat as land area decreases with elevation. To untangle these apparently contradictory predictions for mountainous regions, we evaluated the climatic suitability of four coniferous forest tree species of the western United States based on species distribution modeling (SDM) and examined changes in climatically suitable areas under predicted climate change. We used forest structural information relating to tree species dominance, productivity, and demography from an extensive forest inventory system to assess the strength of inferences made with a SDM approach. We found that tree species dominance, productivity, and recruitment were highest where climatic suitability (i.e., probability of species occurrence under certain climate conditions) was high, supporting the use of predicted climatic suitability in examining species risk to climate change. By predicting changes in climatic suitability over the next century, we found that climatic suitability will likely decline, both in areas currently occupied by each tree species and in nearby unoccupied areas to which species might migrate in the future. These trends were most dramatic for high elevation species. Climatic changes predicted over the next century will dramatically reduce climatically suitable areas for high-elevation tree species while a lower elevation species, Pinus ponderosa, will be well positioned to shift upslope across the region. Reductions in suitable area for high-elevation species imply that even unlimited migration would be insufficient to offset predicted habitat loss, underscoring the vulnerability of these high-elevation species to climatic changes."
"a spatiotemporal pattern analysis of historical mountain pine beetle outbreaks in british columbia, canada","This study documents the spatiotemporal patterns of mountain pine beetle infestations by applying a novel approach based on a landscape infestation dynamics conceptual model in combination with morphological spatial pattern analysis using the mountain pine beetle infested pine mortality data (1960-2010) collected by the annual British Columbia aerial overview survey. The pattern analysis at the provincial level reveals that the 1980s outbreak did not crash as originally thought. The current outbreak is most likely a result of the progressive buildup of the epidemic infestations during the transition period (1985-1995) under favourable weather conditions and substantially improved host resources. This is also true for the Northeast and Cariboo areas of the province specifically, even though the infestations in the Cariboo area remained at incipient-epidemic levels during the transition period after the 1980s outbreak crashed in 1985. In the Southeast area, the current outbreak apparently continued from the outbreak that initiated in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The 1980s outbreak originated from multiple spatially separate locations whereas the current outbreak initiated from a single location in Tweedsmuir Provincial Park. The centralized and self-amplifying buildup of the current outbreak implicates at least three substantial expansions that occurred in 2002, 2006, and 2008. This study suggests that at the provincial level, as well as for the Northeast and Southeast areas of the province, the current outbreak is declining but most likely will continue for many years given the ongoing and future warming climate and a large proportion of pines that remain in the habitats of mountain pine beetles. This study also suggests that dispersals, particularly long-distance dispersal, may play a key role in driving the spread and expansion of the current outbreak although uncertainty remains due to the local dynamics of the beetle populations."
bull trout trends in abundance and probabilities of persistence in idaho,"We estimated the population growth rates of Bull Trout Salvelinus confluentus and used population growth models to evaluate observation error and estimate Bull Trout persistence probabilities by using 25 data sets (averaging 19years of record) that indexed abundance across Idaho. These data sets were derived from a variety of fish sampling techniques, including weirs, screw traps, redd counts, daytime snorkeling, electrofishing, and angler creel. Bull Trout populations in Idaho were relatively stable prior to 1994, but after 1994, substantially more population growth rates trended statistically upward (n = 14) than downward (n = 3). Average intrinsic rates of population change were 0.01 (SE = 0.03) prior to 1994 and 0.07 (SE = 0.02) after 1994; across all years of data, the rate of change averaged 0.07 (SE = 0.02). Fifty-nine percent of the data sets had zero to minimal observation error according to Gompertz state-space model estimates; observation error was least common in data from screw traps and redd counts and most common in snorkel data. Gompertz-type density-dependent models were most often the best-fitting models for Bull Trout population growth. Moreover, few of the most reliable modeling results (i.e., those from data sets estimated to have zero to minimal observation error) contained a period effect or time (i.e., year) effect, suggesting that carrying capacity generally did not differ between the pre-1994 and post-1994 periods and generally was not trending positively or negatively through time. Parametric bootstraps predicted that the mean probability of falling below the quasi-extinction level of 20 adults in the next 30years was 9.8% (median = 4.7%) for data sets estimated to have zero to minimal observation error. The weight of evidence from our modeling results suggests that for most Bull Trout populations in Idaho, abundance is stable or increasing and the risk of extirpation in the foreseeable future is low.

population connectivity and genetic diversity of american marten (martes americana) in the united states northern rocky mountains in a climate change context,"Climate change is likely to alter population connectivity, particularly for species associated with higher elevation environments. The goal of this study is to predict the potential effects of future climate change on population connectivity and genetic diversity of American marten populations across a 30.2 million hectare region of the in the US northern Rocky Mountains. We use a landscape resistance model validated from empirical landscape genetics modeling to predict the current and expected future extent and fragmentation of American marten dispersal habitat under five climate change scenarios, corresponding to climatic warming of between 0.7 and 3.3 A degrees C, consistent with expected climate change by year 2080. We predict the regions of the current and future landscapes where gene flow is expected to be governed by isolation by distance and the regions where population fragmentation is expected to limit gene flow. Finally, we predict changes in the strength and location of predicted movement corridors, fracture zones and the location of dispersal barriers across the study area in each scenario. We found that under the current climate, gene flow is predicted to be limited primarily by distance (isolation), and landscape structure does not significantly limit gene flow, resulting in very high genetic diversity over most of the study area. Projected climatic warming substantially reduces the extent and increases the fragmentation of marten populations in the western and northwestern parts of the study area. In contrast, climate change is not predicted to fragment the extensive higher elevation mountain massifs in central Idaho, the northern U.S. continental divide, and Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. In addition, we show locations in the study area that are important corridors in the current landscape that remain intact across the climate change scenarios."
"the relative influence of temperature, moisture and their interaction on range limits of mammals over the past century","Aims I determine the relative importance of temperature and moisture acting alone and in tandem for range contractions and expansions of mammalian species over c. 70 years. Location The contiguous United States west of the eastern border of the Rocky Mountains (103.77 degrees W). Methods Museum records of 67 mammalian species from two time periods (190039 and 19702009), mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation are used to model historic and modern distributions. For each era the region outside each species' range in the opposing era is assigned to zones of range limitation: temperature alone is prohibitive, moisture alone is prohibitive, both preclude the species, or both have values that alone are within the species' tolerance range but in combination are outside its climatic niche (interaction' limitation). The relative importance of each type of limitation is estimated by their intersection with regions of range contraction and expansion. Results Averaged across species, 82 +/- 3% (+/- SE) of the areas of contraction are now occupied by interaction limitation, and 74 +/- 5% of areas expanded into were historically occupied by similar zones. In comparison, areas of range shift in which just temperature or moisture acting alone would have excluded the species comprise between only 9 and 17%, and areas in which both factors are limiting are negligible. Expansions into and contractions from regions of interaction limitation occurred more often than expected by chance given the distribution of this type of limitation in the wider study region. Main conclusions Particular combinations of temperature and moisture can interact directly or indirectly to limit species ranges even when these factors alone do not exceed species tolerances. Change in the correlation between of range-limiting factors can have as much effect on species ranges as absolute change in those factors by themselves."
spatial and temporal change in the hydro-climatology of the canadian portion of the columbia river basin under multiple emissions scenarios,"The Canadian portion of the Columbia River basin, or Upper Columbia River basin (UCRB), which is made up of the sub-basins of the Columbia and Kootenay rivers, has a hydrologic regime dominated by snow and glacier melt that makes it particularly susceptible to climate change. To investigate the influence of climate change on the water balance and streamflow of the UCRB, simulations are made for a 20-member ensemble made up of seven global climate models (GCMs) run under three emissions scenarios (A1B, A2, and B1 (with one exception)) for three future periods (2020s, 2050s, and 2080s) downscaled using Bias Corrected Spatial Disaggregation and simulated via the spatially distributed Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model. To maximize the utility of the VIC model, a process-based distributed model, it is calibrated to 24 sub-basins. Snow water equivalent (SWE) decreases at lower elevations primarily in the southern portion of the UCRB and increases progressively at high elevations in the north from the 2020s to the 2050s to the 2080s based on the mean of seven GCMs run under the A2 scenario. Evaporation increases where adequate moisture is available in the summer months out to the 2080s. Runoff increases strongly in winter and spring and increases moderately in fall in the UCRB. Mean annual streamflow is projected to increase twice as fast in the northern, higher elevation, Columbia River basin than in the southern Kootenay River basin. Projected increases in mean annual flow are greatest under the A2 emissions scenario, ranging from a 9% increase in the 2020s to a 27% increase in the 2080s in the Columbia River at Keenlyside Dam. Changes in the hydrograph for four sub-basins of the UCRB are most pronounced in the 2080s under the A2 emissions scenario with streamflow increases projected in November to May, decreases in July to September, and mixed responses in June and October. The magnitude of peak flows and low flows is projected to increase for most sub-basins, time periods, and scenarios. Such projected changes could be expected to have implications for water resources management in the basin."
"glacier meltwater contributions and glaciometeorological regime of the illecillewaet river basin, british columbia, canada","This study characterizes the meteorological parameters influencing glacier runoff and quantifies recent glacier contributions to streamflow in the Illecillewaet River basin, British Columbia. The Illecillewaet is a glacierized catchment that feeds the Columbia River, with terrain, glacial cover, and topographic relief that are typical of Columbia River headwaters basins in southwestern Canada. Meteorological and mass balance data collected on Illecillewaet Glacier are used to develop and constrain a distributed model for glacier melt, based on temperature and absorbed solar radiation. The melt model is applied to all of the glaciers in the Illecillewaet River basin for the summers of 2009 to 2011. Modelled glacier runoff for the three years has an average value of 112 +/- 12 x 10(6) m(3), approximately 10% of Illecillewaet River yields for 2009 to 2011. Glaciers contributed 25% to August flows for the three years. On average, 66% of modelled glacial discharge is derived from the seasonal snowpack, with the remaining 34% resulting from the melting of glacier ice and firn. For the lowest flow year in the basin, 2009, snow and ice melt from glaciers in the basin contributed 14% and 33%, respectively; 81% of the August glacier runoff is derived from glacier storage (ice and firn). Climate sensitivity studies for Illecillewaet Glacier indicate that the glacier mass balance is strongly influenced by summer temperature, with a net balance change of -0.6 metres of water equivalent (m w.e.) under a 1 degrees C warming. A 30% increase in winter precipitation is needed to offset this. Our values are initial estimates, and long-term monitoring is essential to characterize glacier and climate variability in the region better, to refine estimates of glacier runoff, and to quantify the sensitivity of runoff to glacier retreat."
controls of summer stream temperature in the pacific northwest,"This is a regional study of the landscape, stream, and channel factors that control summer stream temperatures in the Pacific Northwest. The study focusses on two characteristics of stream temperature: the thermal regime, defined as the pattern of seasonal and spatial stream temperature variation in a stream, and the thermal sensitivity, considered here to be the slope of the stream-air temperature relationship. The baseflow index, or degree of groundwater influence in a stream, is hypothesized to be an important regional control of both thermal regime and thermal sensitivity. Weekly stream temperatures were calculated and evaluated at 104 primarily unregulated sites that were geographically distributed across the region. Air temperature and streamflow explained an average of 94% of the variance in annual thermal regimes and 68% of the variance in August thermal regimes at individual sites. Regression results showed that thermal sensitivity to increasing air temperatures was less in summer than at other times of the year. Future climate projections of summer stream temperature, based on thermal sensitivities, are small in comparison to the range of summer stream temperatures that exist across the region. This observation highlights the need to understand summer thermal regimes as well as summer thermal sensitivities when assessing climate change impacts to regional stream temperatures. Multiple regression analysis identified several landscape factors and stream characteristics that explained summer stream temperatures and thermal sensitivities regionally. Two of the most important factors were baseflow index and stream channel slope. Lastly, the summer stream/air temperature ratio of a stream may be useful in assessing existing or expected stream temperature conditions at a site in relation to these factors or in identifying unique environmental conditions or potential restoration needs at a site.

potential economic benefits of adapting agricultural production systems to future climate change,"Potential economic impacts of future climate change on crop enterprise net returns and annual net farm income (NFI) are evaluated for small and large representative farms in Flathead Valley in Northwest Montana. Crop enterprise net returns and NFI in an historical climate period (1960-2005) and future climate period (2006-2050) are compared when agricultural production systems (APSs) are adapted to future climate change. Climate conditions in the future climate period are based on the A1B, B1, and A2 CO<sub xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">2</sub> emission scenarios from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report. Steps in the evaluation include: (1) specifying crop enterprises and APSs (i.e., combinations of crop enterprises) in consultation with locals producers; (2) simulating crop yields for two soils, crop prices, crop enterprises costs, and NFIs for APSs; (3) determining the dominant APS in the historical and future climate periods in terms of NFI; and (4) determining whether NFI for the dominant APS in the historical climate period is superior to NFI for the dominant APS in the future climate period. Crop yields are simulated using the Environmental/Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model and dominance comparisons for NFI are based on the stochastic efficiency with respect to a function (SERF) criterion. Probability distributions that best fit the EPIC-simulated crop yields are used to simulate 100 values for crop yields for the two soils in the historical and future climate periods. Best-fitting probability distributions for historical inflation-adjusted crop prices and specified triangular probability distributions for crop enterprise costs are used to simulate 100 values for crop prices and crop enterprise costs. Averaged over all crop enterprises, farm sizes, and soil types, simulated net return per ha averaged over all crop enterprises decreased 24% and simulated mean NFI for APSs decreased 57% between the historical and future climate periods. Although adapting APSs to future climate change is advantageous (i.e., NFI with adaptation is superior to NFI without adaptation based on SERF), in six of the nine cases in which adaptation is advantageous, NFI with adaptation in the future climate period is inferior to NFI in the historical climate period. Therefore, adaptation of APSs to future climate change in Flathead Valley is insufficient to offset the adverse impacts on NFI of such change."
reconstructing historical snow depth surfaces to evaluate changes in critical demographic rates and habitat components of snow-dependent and snow-restricted species,"1. Climate change models consistently predict snow depth declines across the Northern Hemisphere. Snow depth has been linked to the demography of numerous species, and snow depth reduction is expected to affect the demography of some northern species. As many demographic studies depend on long-term population data that extend back beyond available sources of spatially continuous snow depth data, reliable hindcasting of snow depth surface maps is needed. 2. We developed a two-stage regression modelling approach to reconstructing historic snow depths using an existing and readily available spatiotemporal data set of daily meteorological variables across a large, heterogeneous landscape in North America from 1982 to 2003. The final model accounted for ecoregional differences and predicted snow depth as a function of elevation and total snowfall accumulation. 3. Model validations showed that the estimated snow depths were spatially and temporally accurate. 4. We demonstrate how to apply this model with ArcGIS to hindcast monthly and yearly sequences of high-resolution, spatially continuous surfaces of historic snow depths. We also illustrate the utility of the modelled snow depth surfaces for informing predictions of how changes in snow depth may influence the demography and habitats of snow-dependent and snow-restricted species by assessing the spatiotemporal stochasticity of snow conditions that potentially benefit wolverine Gulo gulo and the winter ranges, net energy costs and population growth of mule deer Odocoileus hemionus. 5. This model can be used to hindcast snow depth surfaces across similar regions; our simple twostage modelling approach can be applied to other regions where equivalent climate data are available. The resulting spatiotemporal snow depth surfaces estimated from this model can be linked to existing long-term wildlife population data sets to investigate the extent to which snow depth declinesmay regulate or limit populations."
"modeling effects of climate change and fire management on western white pine (pinus monticola) in the northern rocky mountains, usa","Climate change is projected to profoundly influence vegetation patterns and community compositions, either directly through increased species mortality and shifts in species distributions or indirectly through disturbance dynamics such as increased wildfire activity and extent, shifting fire regimes, and pathogenesis. Mountainous landscapes have been shown to be particularly sensitive to climate changes and are likely to experience significant impacts under predicted future climate regimes. Western white pine (Pinus monticola), a five-needle pine species that forms the most diverse of the white pine forest cover types in the western United States, is vulnerable to an interacting suite of threats that includes climate change, fire suppression, white pine blister rust (Cronartium ribicola), and mountain pine beetles (Dendroctonus ponderosae) that have already caused major changes in species distribution and abundance. We used the mechanistic simulation model FireBGCv2 to simulate effects of climate change and fire management on western white pines in a mountainous watershed in Glacier National Park, Montana, USA. Our results suggest that warming temperatures favor increased abundance of western white pine over existing climax and shade tolerant species in the study area, mainly because warmer conditions potentiate fire dynamics, including increased wildfire frequency and extent, which facilitates regeneration. Suppression of wildfires reduced the area dominated by western white pine, but fire suppression was less effective at limiting burned area extent and fire frequency in a warmer and drier climate. Wildfires created canopy gaps that allowed for western white pine regeneration at a high enough rate to escape local extirpation from white pine blister rust. Western white pine appears to be a resilient species even under fairly extreme warming trajectories and shifting fire regimes, and may provide a hedge against vegetation community shifts away from forest types and toward grass and shrublands."
twenty years after the 1988 yellowstone fires: lessons about disturbance and ecosystems,"The 1988 Yellowstone fires were among the first in what has proven to be an upsurge in large severe fires in the western USA during the past 20 years. At the time of the fires, little was known about the impacts of such a large severe disturbance because scientists had had few previous opportunities to study such an event. Ecologists predicted short-and long-term effects of the 1988 fires on vegetation, biogeochemistry, primary productivity, wildlife, and aquatic ecosystems based on scientific understanding of the time. Twenty-plus years of subsequent study allow these early predictions to be evaluated. Most of the original predictions were at least partially supported, but some predictions were refuted, others nuanced, and a few postfire phenomena were entirely unexpected. Post-1988 Yellowstone studies catalyzed advances in ecology focused on the importance of spatial and temporal heterogeneity, contingent influences, and multiple interacting drivers. Post-1988 research in Yellowstone also has changed public perceptions of fire as an ecological process and attitudes towards fire management. Looking ahead to projected climate change and more frequent large fires, the well-documented ecological responses to the 1988 Yellowstone fires provide a foundation for detecting and evaluating potential changes in fire regimes of temperate mountainous regions."
continued warming could transform greater yellowstone fire regimes by mid-21st century,"Climate change is likely to alter wildfire regimes, but the magnitude and timing of potential climate-driven changes in regional fire regimes are not well understood. We considered how the occurrence, size, and spatial location of large fires might respond to climate projections in the Greater Yellowstone ecosystem (GYE) (Wyoming), a large wildland ecosystem dominated by conifer forests and characterized by infrequent, high-severity fire. We developed a suite of statistical models that related monthly climate data (1972-1999) to the occurrence and size of fires >200 ha in the northern Rocky Mountains; these models were cross-validated and then used with downscaled (similar to 12 km x 12 km) climate projections from three global climate models to predict fire occurrence and area burned in the GYE through 2099. All models predicted substantial increases in fire by midcentury, with fire rotation (the time to burn an area equal to the landscape area) reduced to <30 y from the historical 100-300 y for most of the GYE. Years without large fires were common historically but are expected to become rare as annual area burned and the frequency of regionally synchronous fires increase. Our findings suggest a shift to novel fire-climate-vegetation relationships in Greater Yellowstone by midcentury because fire frequency and extent would be inconsistent with persistence of the current suite of conifer species. The predicted new fire regime would transform the flora, fauna, and ecosystem processes in this landscape and may indicate similar changes for other subalpine forests."
the unusual nature of recent snowpack declines in the north american cordillera,"In western North America, snowpack has declined in recent decades, and further losses are projected through the 21st century. Here, we evaluate the uniqueness of recent declines using snowpack reconstructions from 66 tree-ring chronologies in key runoff-generating areas of the Colorado, Columbia, and Missouri River drainages. Over the past millennium, late 20th century snowpack reductions are almost unprecedented in magnitude across the northern Rocky Mountains and in their north-south synchrony across the cordillera. Both the snowpack declines and their synchrony result from unparalleled springtime warming that is due to positive reinforcement of the anthropogenic warming by decadal variability. The increasing role of warming on large-scale snowpack variability and trends foreshadows fundamental impacts on streamflow and water supplies across the western United States."
interspecies synchrony in salmonid densities associated with large-scale bioclimatic conditions in central idaho,"The abundance of lotic salmonids varies substantially through time, but the extent to which several sympatric species respond coherently to large-scale bioclimatic conditions has rarely been investigated for freshwater fishes. We compared correlations in salmonid density in central Idaho and examined the relationships between changes in salmonid density and the variation in large-scale bioclimatic conditions as indexed by stream flow, air temperature, drought, coastal upwelling, and the number of Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha redds (a surrogate for nutrient influx and therefore increased stream productivity). The average densities of six stream-dwelling salmonid fishes were highly synchronous, with declines from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s followed by a rebound through 2003. All pairwise correlations were positive and 8 of 15 were statistically significant. Stream flow and Chinook salmon redds were correlated with fish densities as a group, but the importance of bioclimatic indices differed by species and varied by the lag times applied. Stream flow 3 and 4 years previous was most important for brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis and bull trout S. confluentus. The presence of Chinook salmon redds from the previous year was most important for Chinook salmon. The coastal upwelling index 4 years previous was most important for mountain whitefish Prosopium williamsoni and steelhead O. mykiss. No variable captured much of the variation in the density of westslope cutthroat trout O. clarkii lewisi. Models based on data from 1985 to 2003 correctly predicted the synchronous declines in fish density observed for all species from 2004 to 2009, suggesting that the bioclimatic indices we chose were useful surrogates for large-scale factors influencing the temporal changes in salmonid densities in central Idaho. For fishery managers, interspecies synchrony may allow a more powerful multispecies approach to monitoring and reveal the tractability of large systems to management control. However, causal mechanisms are hard to infer and require further research (e.g., the effects of ocean conditions). Our study provides a basis for such work."
a process-based approach to estimate lodgepole pine (pinus contorta dougl) distribution in the pacific northwest under climate change,"Lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl.) is a widely distributed species in the Pacific Northwest of North America. The extent that the current distribution of this species may be altered under a changing climate is an important question for managers of wood supply as well as those interested in conservation of subalpine ecosystems. In this paper, we address the question, how much might the current range of the species shift under a changing climate? We first assessed the extent that suboptimal temperature, frost, drought, and humidity deficits affect photosynthesis and growth of the species across the Pacific Northwest with a process-based model (3-PG). We then entered the same set of climatic variables into a decision-tree model, which creates a suite of rules that differentially rank the variables, to provide a basis for predicting presence or absence of the species under current climatic conditions. The derived decision-tree model successfully predicted weighted presence and absence recorded on 12,660 field survey plots with an accuracy of similar to 70%. The analysis indicated that sites with significant spring frost, summer temperatures averaging < 15A degrees C and soils that fully recharged from snowmelt were most likely to support lodgepole pine. Based on these criteria, we projected climatic conditions through the twenty-first century as they might develop without additional efforts to reduce carbon emissions using the Canadian Climate Centre model (CGCM2). In the 30-year period centered around 2020, the area suitable for lodgepole pine in the Pacific Northwest was projected to be reduced only slightly (8%). Thereafter, however, the projected climatic conditions appear to progressively favor other species, so that by the last 30 years of twenty-first century, lodgepole pine could be nearly absent from much of its current range. We conclude that process-based models, because they are highly sensitive to seasonal variation in solar radiation, are well adapted to identify the importance of different climatic variables on photosynthesis and growth. These same variables, once indentified, and run through a decision-tree model, provide a reasonable approach to predict current and future patterns in a species' distribution."
observations and modeling of aboveground tree carbon stocks and fluxes following a bark beetle outbreak in the western united states,"Bark beetle epidemics result in tree mortality across millions of hectares in North America. However, few studies have quantified impacts on carbon (C) cycling. In this study, we quantified the immediate response and subsequent trajectories of stand-level aboveground tree C stocks and fluxes using field measurements and modeling for a location in central Idaho, USA that experienced an outbreak of mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins). We measured tree characteristics in lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) plots spanning a range of structure and mortality conditions. We then initialized the forest vegetation simulator, an individual tree-based model, with these measurements and simulated the response of aboveground production of C fluxes as well as trajectories of C stocks and fluxes in the coming decades. Mountain pine beetles killed up to 52% of the trees within plots, with more larger trees killed. C stocks in lodgepole pine were reduced by 31-83% following the outbreak, and plot-level C fluxes decreased 28-73%. Modeled C stocks increased nearly continuously following the infestation, recovering to preoutbreak levels in 25 years or less. Simulated aboveground tree C fluxes increased following the immediate postoutbreak decrease, then subsequently declined. Substantial variability of C stocks and fluxes among plots resulted from the number and size of killed and surviving trees. Our study illustrates that bark beetle epidemics alter forest C cycling unlike stand-replacement wildfires or clear-cut harvests, due in part to incomplete mortality coupled with the preference by beetles for larger trees. The dependency of postoutbreak C stocks and fluxes on stand structure suggests that C budget models and studies in areas experiencing mountain pine beetle disturbances need to include size distribution of trees for the most accurate results."
"groundwater level responses in temperate mountainous terrain: regime classification, and linkages to climate and streamflow","Groundwater responses in temperate mountainous terrain are assessed using groundwater, hydrometric and climatic data from southern British Columbia, Canada. Well and stream hydrographs are analysed using a series of diagnostic tools including time series plots, hysteresis plots, and cross-correlation plots. Characterizing the seasonal timing of the response requires consideration of the hydroclimatology of the region: rainfall-dominated (pluvial), snowmelt-dominated (nival) or hybrid (mixture of rain and snow). The magnitude and timing of the recharge and discharge response of the groundwater system was shown to depend on the storage and permeability characteristics of the aquifer and whether the system is stream-driven or recharge-driven. These two dominant stream-aquifer system types were defined based on classifying different aquifer types found in the southwest portion of the province. The classification scheme and diagnostic tools have the potential to provide a framework for evaluating the responses of wells in other mountainous regions. Using this framework, the potential consequences of future climate change may then be better understood based on the interactions between the hydrogeological and hydroclimatic settings of these aquifers.

local atmospheric decoupling in complex topography alters climate change impacts,"Cold air drainage and pooling occur in many mountain valleys, especially at night and during winter. Local climate regimes associated with frequent cold air pooling have substantial impacts on species phenology, distribution and diversity. However, little is known about how the degree and frequency of cold air drainage and pooling will respond to a changing climate. Evidence suggests that, because cold pools are decoupled from the free atmosphere, these local climates may not respond in the same way as regional-scale climates estimated from coarse-grid general circulation models. Indeed, recent studies have demonstrated that historical changes M the frequency of synoptic conditions have produced complex spatial variations in the resulting climatic changes on the ground. In the mountainous terrain of the Oregon Cascades, we show that, at relatively exposed hill slope and ridge top locations, air temperatures are highly coupled to changes in synoptic circulation patterns at the 700-hPa level, whereas in sheltered valley bottoms, cold air pooling at night and during winter causes temperatures to be largely decoupled from, and relatively insensitive to, 700-hPa How variations. The result is a complex temperature landscape composed of steep gradients in temporal variation. controlled largely by gradients in elevation and topographic position. When a projected climate warming of 2.5 degrees C was combined with likely changes in the frequency distribution of synoptic circulation, modelled temperature changes at closely spaced locations diverged widely (by up to 6 degrees C), with differences equalling or exceeding that of the imposed regional temperature change. Because cold air pooling and consequent atmospheric decoupling occur in many mountain valleys, especially at high latitudes. this phenomenon is likely to he an important consideration in understanding the impacts of climate change in mountainous regions.

"forest ecosystems, disturbance, and climatic change in washington state, usa","Climatic change is likely to affect Pacific Northwest (PNW) forests in several important ways. In this paper, we address the role of climate in four forest ecosystem processes and project the effects of future climatic change on these processes across Washington State. First, we relate Douglas-fir growth to climatic limitation and suggest that where Douglas-fir is currently water-limited, growth is likely to decline due to increased summer water deficit. Second, we use existing analyses of climatic controls on tree species biogeography to demonstrate that by the mid twenty-first century, climate will be less suitable for key species in some areas of Washington. Third, we examine the relationships between climate and the area burned by fire and project climatically driven regional and sub-regional increases in area burned. Fourth, we suggest that climatic change influences mountain pine beetle (MPB) outbreaks by increasing host-tree vulnerability and by shifting the region of climate suitability upward in elevation. The increased rates of disturbance by fire and mountain pine beetle are likely to be more significant agents of changes in forests in the twenty-first century than species turnover or declines in productivity, suggesting that understanding future disturbance regimes is critical for successful adaptation to climate change."
surface temperature lapse rates over complex terrain: lessons from the cascade mountains,"The typically sparse distribution of weather stations in mountainous terrain inadequately resolves temperature variability. Accordingly, high-resolution gridding of climate data (for applications such as hydrological modeling) often relies on assumptions such as a constant surface temperature lapse rate (i.e., decrease of surface temperature with altitude) of 6.5 degrees C km(-1). Using an example of the Cascade Mountains, we describe the temporal and spatial variability of the surface temperature lapse rate, combining data from: (1) COOP stations, (2) nearby radiosonde launches, (3) a temporary dense network of sensors, (4) forecasts from the MM5 regional model, and (5) PRISM geo-statistical analyses. On the windward side of the range, the various data sources reveal annual mean lapse rates of 3.9-5.2 degrees C km(-1), substantially smaller than the often-assumed 6.5 degrees C km(-1). The data sets show similar seasonal and diurnal variability, with lapse rates smallest (2.5-3.5 degrees C km(-1)) in late-summer minimum temperatures, and largest (6.5-7.5 degrees C km(-1)) in spring maximum temperatures. Geographic (windward versus lee side) differences in lapse rates are found to be substantial. Using a simple runoff model, we show the appreciable implications of these results for hydrological modeling."
a new look at snowpack trends in the cascade mountains,"This study examines the changes in Cascade Mountain spring snowpack since 1930. Three new time series facilitate this analysis: a water-balance estimate of Cascade snowpack from 1930 to 2007 that extends the observational record 20 years earlier than standard snowpack measurements; a radiosonde-based time series of lower-tropospheric temperature during onshore flow, to which Cascade snowpack is well correlated; and a new index of the North Pacific sea level pressure pattern that encapsulates modes of variability to which Cascade spring snowpack is particularly sensitive. Cascade spring snowpack declined 23% during 1930-2007. This loss is nearly statistically significant at the 5% level. The snowpack increased 19% during the recent period of most rapid global warming (1976-2007), though this change is not statistically significant because of large annual variability. From 1950 to 1997, a large and statistically significant decline of 48% occurred. However, 80% of this decline is connected to changes in the circulation patterns over the North Pacific Ocean that vary naturally on annual to interdecadal time scales. The residual time series of Cascade snowpack after Pacific variability is removed displays a relatively steady loss rate of 2.0% decade (1), yielding a loss of 16% from 1930 to 2007. This loss is very nearly statistically significant and includes the possible impacts of anthropogenic global warming. The dates of maximum snowpack and 90% melt out have shifted 5 days earlier since 1930. Both shifts are statistically insignificant. A new estimate of the sensitivity of Cascade spring snowpack to temperature of -11% per degrees C, when combined with climate model projections of 850-hPa temperatures offshore of the Pacific Northwest, yields a projected 9% loss of Cascade spring snowpack due to anthropogenic global warming between 1985 and 2025."
"relationship between fire, climate oscillations, and drought in british columbia, canada, 1920-2000","Climate oscillations such as El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) are known to affect temperature and precipitation regimes and fire in different regions of the world. Understanding the relationships between climate oscillations, drought, and area burned in the past is required for anticipating potential impacts of regional climate change and for effective wildfire-hazard management. These relationships have been investigated for British Columbia (BC), Canada, either as part of national studies with coarse spatial resolution or for single ecosystems. Because of BC's complex terrain and strong climatic gradients, an investigation with higher spatial resolution may allow for a spatially complete but differentiated picture. In this study, we analyzed the annual proportion burned-climate oscillation-drought relationships for the province's 16 Biogeoclimatic Ecosystem Classification (BEC) zones. Analyses are based on a digital, spatially explicit fire database, climate oscillation indices, and monthly precipitation and temperature data with a spatial resolution of 400 m for the period 1920-2000. Results show that (1) fire variability is better related to summer drought than to climate oscillations, and that (2) fire variability is most strongly related to both, climate oscillations and summer drought in southeastern BC. The relationship of area burned and summer drought is strong for lower elevations in western BC as well. The influence of climate oscillations on drought is strongest and most extensive in winter and spring, with higher indices being related to drier conditions. Winter and spring PDO and additive winter and spring PDO+ENSO indices show BC's most extensive significant relationship to fire variability. Western BC is too wet to show a moisture deficit in summer that would increase annual area burned due to teleconnections."
spatial patterns of glaciers in response to spatial patterns in regional climate,"Glaciers are direct recorders of climate history and have come to be regarded as emblematic of climate change. They respond to variations in both accumulation and ablation, which can have separate atmospheric controls, leading to some ambiguity in interpreting the causes of glacier changes. Both climate change and climate variability have characteristic spatial patterns and time scales. The focus of this study is the regional-scale response of glaciers to natural patterns of climate variability. Using the Pacific Northwest of North America as the setting, the authors employ a simple linear glacier model to study how the combination of patterns of melt-season temperature and patterns of annual accumulation produce patterns of glacier length variations. Regional-scale spatial correlations in glacier length variations reflect three factors: the spatial correlations in precipitation and melt-season temperature, the geometry of a glacier and how it determines the relative importance of temperature and precipitation, and the climatic setting of the glaciers (i.e., maritime or continental). With the self-consistent framework developed here, the authors are able to evaluate the relative importance of these three factors. The results also highlight that, in order to understand the natural variability of glaciers, it is critically important to know the small-scale patterns of climate in mountainous terrain. The method can be applied to any area containing mountain glaciers and provides a baseline expectation for natural glacier variation against which the effects of climate changes can be evaluated."
"distribution, rarity and habitats of three aquatic lichens on federal land in the us pacific northwest","In this study, the occurrence of Dermatocarpon meiophyllizum, Leptogium rivale and Peltigera hydrothyria on federal land in western Oregon and Washington, and northern California is documented using a large-scale random sampling approach amplified by historical site data, frequency, distribution and habitat ""preferences,"" including water quality, forest age and land use allocations. A total of 256 sites were surveyed, of which 216 were randomly selected. All three species were distributed throughout the study area in all three states, and mostly in interior mountain ranges. Only L. rivale was widespread, and both D. nielophylli2lini and P. hydrothyria appear to be rare in the region but can become locally common in some watersheds. All three lichens probably benefit from older streamside forests, but association with forest age was inconclusive at the watershed level. Federal protective land use allocations and Aquatic Conservation Strategy components appear to play a minor role in protecting existing populations for the three aquatic lichens. Climate factors appear to be of major importance to habitat suitability for the three aquatic lichens. Results from this Study suggest the following habitat summaries for the three aquatic lichens. Higher elevation, exposed streams with large rocks or bedrock appear to be important habitat for D. meiophyllizum. This lichen was also often found above the stream water level. Leptogium rivale was found most frequently in shallow, partially shaded streams and submerged or just above the water level. For P. hydrothyria, this study suggests that cool, partially shaded small Mountain streams are important habitat; however, this only appears to be habitat characteristics for this lichen from southern Washington and Southward in the Study area. In Washington's North Cascades and in to British Columbia, P. hydrothyria is often observed in colder, higher elevation exposed sites. Upper 95% confidence interval values for stream sites Suggests good water quality across the region: dissolved oxygen = 9.60 mg(-1), conductivity = 78 mu S/cm, pH = 7.51, nitrogen 0.07 mg(-1) and phosphorus = 0.024 mg(-1). Benthic diatom-based indices suggest that these aquatic lichens are subject to siltation and high flow stream scouring. Results from this Study can be used to guide management in the face of global climate change and research needs are discussed."
a mechanistic assessment of nutrient flushing at the catchment scale,"Quantifying nutrient flushing mechanisms at the catchment scale is essential for model development and prediction of land use change and climate change effects on surface water quality. To date, the description of nutrient flushing at the catchment scale has been largely mechanistically weak. This paper mechanistically assesses the flushing mechanism of DOC, DON and DIN at the hillslope and catchment scale during two storm events, in a small catchment (WS10), H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest in the western Cascade Mountains of Oregon. Using a combination of natural tracer and hydrometric data, and end-member mixing analysis we were able to describe the exact flushing mechanism at the site. This mechanism involved vertical preferential flow to the soil-bedrock interface and then lateral downslope flow, with a finite source of DOC and DON in the organic horizon. Both specific UV absorbance (SUVA, 254 nm) and continuously measured raw fluorescence measured with a fluorometer increased during the storm events, suggesting DOC was more aromatic during stormflow compared to baseflow conditions. SUVA patterns in lateral subsurface flow from the hillslope and stream water in combination with hydrometric data enabled us to infer that the contribution of deep soil water and groundwater was higher during the falling limb compared to the rising limb of the hydrograph and contributed to the dilution of DOC, DON and SUVA values during storm events. Overall this study showed the value of using a combination of hydrometric data, natural tracer data, and in particular DOC quality indices such as SUVA and fluorescence to mechanistically assess nutrient flushing at the catchment scale.

geographic variation in growth response of douglas-fir to interannual climate variability and projected climate change,"We used 179 tree ring chronologies of Douglas-fir [<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Pseudotsuga menziesii</i> (Mirb.) Franco] from the International Tree-Ring Data Bank to study radial growth response to historical climate variability. For the coastal variety of Douglas-fir, we found positive correlations of ring width with summer precipitation and temperature of the preceding winter, indicating that growth of coastal populations was limited by summer dryness and that photosynthesis in winter contributed to growth. For the interior variety, low precipitation and high growing season temperatures limited growth. Based on these relationships, we chose a simple heat moisture index (growing season temperature divided by precipitation of the preceding winter and current growing season) to predict growth response for the interior variety. For 105 tree ring chronologies or 81% of the interior samples, we found significant linear correlations with this heat moisture index, and moving correlation functions showed that the response was stable over time (1901-1980). We proceeded to use those relationships to predict regional growth response under 18 climate change scenarios for the 2020s, 2050s, and 2080s with unexpected results: for comparable changes in heat moisture index, the most southern and outlying populations of Douglas-fir in Mexico showed the least reduction in productivity. Moderate growth reductions were found in the southern United States, and strongly negative response in the central Rocky Mountains. Growth reductions were further more pronounced for high than for low elevation populations. Based on regional differences in the slope of the growth-climate relationship, we propose that southern populations are better adapted to drought conditions and could therefore contain valuable genotypes for reforestation under climate change. The results support the view that climate change may impact species not just at the trailing edges but throughout their range due to genetic adaptation of populations to local environments."
a comparison of snotel and ghcn/cru surface temperatures with free-air temperatures at high elevations in the western united states: data compatibility and trends,"This paper compares high-elevation surface temperatures based on the Global Historical Climate Network/Climatic Research Unit (GHCN/CRU) and snow telemetry (SNOTEL) datasets, with simultaneous free-air equivalent temperatures, interpolated from NCEP-NCAR reanalysis. Mean monthly temperature anomalies from 1982 to 1999 are examined for 60 SNOTEL and 296 GHCN/CRU sites at elevations over 500 m with relatively homogenous records. The surface/free-air temperature difference Delta T (T-s - T-a) is calculated for both the SNOTEL and GHCN/CRU datasets. Topography influences the correlation between surface and free-air temperature anomalies. Physically realistic diurnal and seasonal changes in Delta T are illustrated. Systematic secular trends in surface temperatures, free-air temperatures, and Delta T are revealed, but the sign and magnitude of change depends on location, meaning that regional signals are weak. The T-s trends are positive for most GHCN and CRU sites, and for SNOTEL sites at night. Daytime cooling in the SNOTEL network reduces the mean daily warming trend. The T-s trends are consistently positive for both networks and are often larger than T-s Thus mean Delta T trends are negative for both datasets. The smaller sample size in the SNOTEL dataset means that error estimates for regional signals are much wider than for the GHCN/CRU dataset. Trend difference maps identify potentially anomalous SNOTEL records. Trends show no correlation with elevation and topography. Surface trends show higher variability and account for most of the uncertainty in Delta T trends. Sensitivity of trends to time period is also discussed. Such changes in the free-air/surface temperature difference may indicate change in the energy balance of mountain areas."
a method for estimating vulnerability of douglas-fir growth to climate change in the northwestern us,"Borrowing from landscape ecology, atmospheric science, and integrated assessment, we aim to understand the complex interactions that determine productivity in montane forests and utilize such relationships to forecast montane forest vulnerability under global climate change. Specifically, we identify, relationships for precipitation and temperature that govern the spatiotemporal variability in Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) growth by seeking similarities in patterns of growth/climate models across a significant portion of the climatological range of the species. In the 21(st) century and beyond, sustainable forestry will depend on successful adaptation to the impacts of climate change and climate variability on forest structure and function. The combination of these foci will allow improved prediction of the fate of montane forests over a wide range of biogeoclimatic conditions in western North America and thus allow improved management strategies for adapting to climate change. We describe a multi-disciplinary strategy for analyzing growth variability as a function of climate over a broad range of local-to-regional influences and demonstrate the efficacy of this sampling method in defining regional gradients of growth-limiting factors."
columbia river flow and drought since 1750,"A network of 32 drought sensitive tree-ring chronologies is used to reconstruct mean water year flow on the Columbia River at The Dalles, Oregon, since 1750. The reconstruction explains 30 percent of the variability in mean water year (October to September) flow, with a large portion of unexplained variance caused by underestimates of the most severe low flow events. Residual statistics from the tree-ring reconstruction, as well as an identically specified instrumental reconstruction, exhibit positive trends over time. This finding suggests that the relationship between drought and streamflow has changed over time, supporting results from hydrologic models, which suggest that changes in land cover over the 20th Century have had measurable impacts on runoff production. Low pass filtering the flow record suggests that persistent low flows during the 1840s were probably the most severe of the past 250 years, but that flows during the 1930s were nearly as extreme. The period from 1950 to 1987 is anomalous in the context of this record for having no notable multiyear drought events. A comparison of the flow reconstruction to paleorecords of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) support a strong 20th Century link between large scale circulation and streamflow, but suggests that this link is very weak prior to 1900."
vegetation sensitivity to global anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions in a topographically complex region,"[1] Anthropogenic increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations may affect vegetation distribution both directly through changes in photosynthesis and water-use efficiency, and indirectly through CO2-induced climate change. Using an equilibrium vegetation model (BIOME4) driven by a regional climate model (RegCM2.5), we tested the sensitivity of vegetation in the western United States, a topographically complex region, to the direct, indirect, and combined effects of doubled preindustrial atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Those sensitivities were quantified using the kappa statistic. Simulated vegetation in the western United States was sensitive to changes in atmospheric CO2 concentrations, with woody biome types replacing less woody types throughout the domain. The simulated vegetation was also sensitive to climatic effects, particularly at high elevations, due to both warming throughout the domain and decreased precipitation in key mountain regions such as the Sierra Nevada of California and the Cascade and Blue Mountains of Oregon. Significantly, when the direct effects of CO2 on vegetation were tested in combination with the indirect effects of CO2-induced climate change, new vegetation patterns were created that were not seen in either of the individual cases. This result indicates that climatic and nonclimatic effects must be considered in tandem when assessing the potential impacts of elevated CO2 levels."
the role of climate and vegetation change in shaping past and future fire regimes in the northwestern us and the implications for ecosystem management,"Fire is an important part of the disturbance regimes of northwestern US forests and its role in maintaining and altering forest vegetation is evident in the paleoecological record of the region. Long-tenri reconstructions of Holocene fire regimes, provided by the analysis of charcoal, pollen, and other fire proxies in a network of lake records, indicate that the Pacific Northwest and summer-dry regions of the northern Rocky Mountains experienced their highest fire activity in the early Holocene (11,000-7000 years ago) and during the Medieval Warm Period (ca. 1000 years ago) when drought conditions were more severe than today. In contrast, in summer-wet areas of the northern Rocky Mountains, the period of highest fire activity was registered in the last 7000 years when dry woodland vegetation developed. When synthesized across the entire northwestern US, the paleoecological record reveals that past and present fire regimes are strongly controlled by climate changes occurring on multiple time scales. The scarcity of fires in the 20th century in some northwestern US ecosystems may be the result of successful fire suppression policies, but in wetter forests this absence is consistent with long-term fire regime patterns. In addition, simulations of potential future climate and vegetation indicate that future fire conditions in some parts of the northwestern US could be more severe than they are today. The Holocene record of periods of intensified summer drought is used to assess the nature of future fire-climate-vegetation linkages in the region. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

belowground carbon pools and processes in different age stands of douglas-fir,"Forest floor material and soil organic matter may act as both a source and a sink in global CO(2) cycles. Thus, the ecosystem processes controlling these pools are central to understanding the transfers of carbon (C) between the atmosphere and terrestrial systems. To examine these ecosystem processes, the effect of stand age on temporal carbon source-sink relationships was examined in 20-year-old, 40-year-old and old-growth stands of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) in the Cascade Mountains of south-central Washington State. Belowground C and nitrogen (N) storage and soil respiration were measured. In addition, nylon mesh bags containing homogenized soils from each site were buried at the respective sites to quantify root ingrowth and potential C sequestration and loss. The sites supporting the 20- and 40-year-old stands had soil C stores reflecting the C contributions from logging residue, coarse woody debris and stumps left after harvest. Because the N-fixer red alder (Alnus rubra Bong.) comprised 33% of the 40-year-old stand, this site had significantly greater concentrations and pools of N in the forest floor than sites without red alder. This N-rich site had consistently lower soil CO(2) efflux rates during the growing season than the sites supporting the 20-year-old and old-growth stands. Estimated annual soil C efflux was 1367, 883 and 1194 g m(-2) for the sites supporting the 20-, 40- and old-growth stands, respectively. These values are higher than previously reported values. Root ingrowth was significantly less in the 40-year-old stand than in the 20-year-old stand, and both young stands showed markedly less fine root growth than the old-growth stand. At the sites supporting the young stands, C and N were lost from the soil bags, whereas there was an increase in C and N in the soil bags at the site supporting the old-growth stand. The fine root growth and soil respiration data support the hypothesis that belowground C allocation decreases with increasing fertility. Quantification of the source-sink relationship of soil C at the three stands based on litterfall, relative root ingrowth and soil respiration measurements was compromised because of significant CO(2) flux from decaying organic matter in the young stands."
ecosystem dynamics and disturbance in mountain wildernesses: assessing vulnerability of natural resources to change,"An integrated program of ecosystem modeling and extensive field studies at Glacier and Olympic National Parks has quantified many of the ecological processes affected by climatic variability and disturbance. Models have successfully estimated snow distribution, annual watershed discharge, and stream temperature variation based on seven years of monitoring. Various climatic scenarios were applied with the models to examine potential future wilderness conditions. This modeling indicates that reduced net primary productivity and altered disturbance patterns can be expected in dry, east-side forest ecosystems in Montana and Washington under climatic warming. In addition, empirical studies show that climatic variability has strong teleconnections with tree growth and regeneration at annual to decadal scales, resulting in predictable, directional changes under different climatic scenarios. A transect of mountain bioregions from the Pacific Coast to the Rocky Mountains, which builds on past research, is determining how future climatic variability will affect wilderness in the context of regional ecosystem dynamics."
climate change effects on stream and river temperatures across the northwest us. from 1980-2009 and implications for salmonid fishes.,"Thermal regimes in rivers and streams are fundamentally important to aquatic ecosystems and are expected to change in response to climate forcing as the Earth's temperature warms. Description and attribution of stream temperature changes are key to understanding how these ecosystems may be affected by climate change, but difficult given the rarity of long-term monitoring data. We assembled 18 temperature time-series from sites on regulated and unregulated streams in the northwest U.S. to describe historical trends from 1980-2009 and assess thermal consistency between these stream categories. Statistically significant temperature trends were detected across seven sites on unregulated streams during all seasons of the year, with a cooling trend apparent during the spring and warming trends during the summer, fall, and winter. The amount of warming more than compensated for spring cooling to cause a net temperature increase, and rates of warming were highest during the summer (raw trend=0.17������C/decade; reconstructed trend=0.22������C/decade). Air temperature was the dominant factor explaining long-term stream temperature trends (82-94% of trends) and inter-annual variability (48-86% of variability), except during the summer when discharge accounted for approximately half (52%) of the inter-annual variation in stream temperatures. Seasonal temperature trends at eleven sites on regulated streams were qualitatively similar to those at unregulated sites if two sites managed to reduce summer and fall temperatures were excluded from the analysis. However, these trends were never statistically significant due to greater variation among sites that resulted from local water management policies and effects of upstream reservoirs. Despite serious deficiencies in the stream temperature monitoring record, our results suggest many streams in the northwest U.S. are exhibiting a regionally coherent response to climate forcing. More extensive monitoring efforts are needed as are techniques for short-term sensitivity analysis and reconstructing historical temperature trends so that spatial and temporal patterns of warming can be better understood. Continuation of warming trends this century will increasingly stress important regional salmon and trout resources and hamper efforts to recover these species, so comprehensive vulnerability assessments are needed to provide strategic frameworks for prioritizing conservation efforts."
the economic impact of the mountain pine beetle infestation in british columbia: provincial estimates from a cge analysis,"The mountain pine beetle (MPB) epidemic in British Columbia (BC) peaked in 2004 and 2005, and by 2012,. 53 per cent of the merchantable pine had been attacked. The annual kill has declined steadily since 2005 and is projected to continue to do so. However, given the significant amount of beetle killed wood, the timber supply is expected to fall dramatically in the coming decades. This study estimates the future provincial economic impacts of the MPB infestation in a dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) model, by examining the effects of the reduction in timber supply from BC forests over the 2009-2054 period. Results suggest that there will be a cumulative present value loss of $57.37 billion (or 1.34 per cent) in GDP and a $90 billion decline in welfare (compensating variation) from 2009 to 2054 in BC. These estimates emphasize the significance of negative economic impacts that may be in store for the economy in this, and potentially other provinces, and can be used to help policy-makers better understand the net benefits of adaptation options geared towards reducing the spread of such pests."
applying resilience concepts in forest management: a retrospective simulation approach,"Increasing the resilience of ecological and sociological systems has been proposed as an option to adapt to changing future climatic conditions. However, few studies test the applicability of those strategies to forest management. This paper uses a real forest health incident to assess the ability of forest management strategies to affect ecological and economic resilience of the forest. Two landscape scale strategies are compared to business as usual management for their ability to increase resilience to a climate-change induced mountain pine beetle outbreak in the Kamloops Timber Supply Area, British Columbia, Canada for the period 1980 to 2060. Proactive management to reduce high risk species while maintaining or increasing diversity through reforestation was found to be more resilient in terms of the metrics: post-disturbance growing stock, improved volume and stability of timber flow, and net revenue. However, landscape-scale indicators of diversity were little affected by management. Our results were robust to uncertainty in tree growth rates and timber value and show that adapting to climate change through improving the resilience of forested landscapes is an economically viable option."
rethinking the longitudinal stream temperature paradigm: region-wide comparison of thermal infrared imagery reveals unexpected complexity of river temperatures,"Prevailing theory suggests that stream temperature warms asymptotically in a downstream direction, beginning at the temperature of the source in the headwaters and levelling off downstream as it converges to match meteorological conditions. However, there have been few empirical examples of longitudinal patterns of temperature in large rivers due to a paucity of data. We constructed longitudinal thermal profiles (temperature vs distance) for 53 rivers in the Pacific Northwest (USA) using an extensive data set of remotely sensed summertime river temperatures and classified each profile into one of five patterns of downstream warming: asymptotic (increasing then flattening), linear (increasing steadily), uniform (not changing), parabolic (increasing then decreasing), or complex (not fitting other classes). We evaluated (1) how frequently profiles warmed asymptotically downstream as expected, and (2) whether relationships between river temperature and common hydroclimatic variables differed by profile class. We found considerable diversity in profile shape, with 47% of rivers warming asymptotically and 53% having alternative profile shapes. Water temperature did not warm substantially over the course of the river for coastal parabolic and uniform profiles, and for some linear and complex profiles. Profile classes showed no clear geographical trends. The degree of correlation between river temperature and hydroclimatic variables differed among profile classes, but there was overlap among classes. Water temperature in rivers with asymptotic or parabolic profiles was positively correlated with August air temperature, tributary temperature and velocity, and negatively correlated with elevation, August precipitation, gradient and distance upstream. Conversely, associations were less apparent in rivers with linear, uniform or complex profiles. Factors contributing to the unique shape of parabolic profiles differed for coastal and inland rivers, where downstream cooling was influenced locally by climate or cool water inputs, respectively. Potential drivers of shape for complex profiles were specific to each river. These thermal patterns indicate diverse thermal habitats that may promote resilience of aquatic biota to climate change. Without this spatial context, climate change models may incorrectly estimate loss of thermally suitable habitat. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
production and nutrient content of two shrub species related to fire in central idaho,"Nutrient content and weight of current year's growth of Cercocarpus ledifolius Nuttall and Physocarpus malvaceus (Greene) Kuntze in central Idaho were obtained during early July in the years 1987-2007. The purpose of this work was to determine whether there was significant variation between years and whether mean monthly temperatures and total monthly precipitation could predict the variation. A wildfire in August 2000 caused P. malvaceus to vigorously resprout. Significant differences between years occurred for all nutrients for both species. October temperatures best predicted weight of current year's growth in C. ledifolius, whereas prediction equations for nutrients involved spring temperatures and precipitation, primarily for June. January mean temperature and December precipitation best predicted weight of current year's growth, and spring mean monthly temperatures best predicted nutrient levels in P. malvaceus. Future changes in production and nutrient content of these species that are not predicted may be related to climate change."
multi-scale environmental filters and niche partitioning govern the distributions of riparian vegetation guilds,"Across landscapes, riparian plant communities assemble under varying levels of disturbance, environmental stress, and resource availability, leading to the development of distinct riparian life-history guilds over evolutionary timescales. Identifying the environmental filters that exert selective pressures on specific riparian vegetation guilds is a critical step in setting baseline expectations for how riparian vegetation may respond to environmental conditions anticipated under future global change scenarios. In this study, we ask: (1) What riparian plant guilds exist across the interior Columbia and upper Missouri River basins? (2) What environmental filters shape riparian guild distributions? (3) How does resource partitioning among guilds influence guild distributions and co-occurrence? Woody species composition was measured at 703 stream reaches and each species' morphological and functional attributes were extracted from a database in four categories: (1) life form, (2) persistence and growth, (3) reproduction, and (4) resource use. We clustered species into guilds by morphological characteristics and attributes related to environmental tolerances, modeling these guilds' distributions as a function of environmental filters-regional climate, watershed hydrogeomorphic characteristics, and stream channel form-and guild coexistence. We identified five guilds: (1) a tall, deeply rooted, long-lived, evergreen tree guild, (2) a xeric, disturbance tolerant shrub guild, (3) a hydrophytic, thicket-forming shrub guild, (4) a low-statured, shade-tolerant, understory shrub guild, and (5) a flood tolerant, mesoriparian shrub guild. Guilds were most strongly discriminated by species' rooting depth, canopy height and potential to resprout and grow following biomass-removing disturbance (e.g., flooding, fire). Hydro-climatic variables, including precipitation, watershed area, water table depth, and channel form attributes reflective of hydrologic regime, were predictors of guilds whose life history strategies had affinity or aversion to flooding, drought, and fluvial disturbance. Biotic interactions excluded guilds with divergent life history strategies and/or allowed for the co-occurrence of guilds that partition resources differently in the same environment. We conclude that the riparian guild framework provides insight into how disturbance and bioclimatic gradients shape riparian functional plant diversity across heterogeneous landscapes. Multiple environmental filters should be considered when the riparian response guild framework is to be used as a decision-support tool framework across large spatial extents."
"adapting transportation to climate change on federal lands in washington state, usa","Research scientists collaborated with federal land managers of two national parks and two national forests to conduct a climate change vulnerability assessment and to identify adaptation strategies for a transportation network covering 28,900 km of roads and trails in north-central Washington, U.S.A. The assessment employed observations of sensitivity and response to climatic variability, downscaled climate projections, literature reviews, current management policies and practices, expert knowledge, and stakeholder engagement. Primary pathways for climate impacts focused on projected increases in extreme high flows and flooding, elevated winter soil moisture and landslide hazards, and loss of snowpack. The biggest impacts to roads and trails are expected from temperature-induced changes in hydrologic regimes that enhance autumn flooding and reduce spring snowpack. Projected higher winter soil moisture caused by changes in seasonal precipitation and snow accumulation could reduce slope stability. Earlier snowmelt may lengthen the snow-free season for visitor use and agency operations. Infrastructure age, design, maintenance, location, use, and limited redundancy along with funding policies and management, influence the sensitivities of the transportation system. Vulnerabilities were identified based on when and where these sensitivities to changes in climate may emerge. Adaptation strategies and tactics identified to address these vulnerabilities included: upgrading stream crossing and drainage design, changing use and maintenance, relocating or closing roads and trails, modifying funding policies, and expanding pubic engagement. Many adaptation options are ""no regrets"" approaches to changes in climate projected for the 2040s and 2080s that can be applied to other resource sectors and mountainous regions."
elevation-dependent responses of streamflow to climate warming,"Warming will affect snowline elevation, potentially altering the timing and magnitude of streamflow from mountain landscapes. Presently, the assessment of potential elevation-dependent responses is difficult because many gauged watersheds integrate drainage areas that are both snow and rain dominated. To predict the impact of snowline rise on streamflow, we mapped the current snowline (1980m) for the Salmon River watershed (Idaho, USA) and projected its elevation after 3 degrees C warming (2440m). This increase results in a 40% reduction in snow-covered area during winter months. We expand this analysis by collecting streamflow records from a new, elevation-stratified gauging network of watersheds contained within high (2250-3800m), mid (1500-2250m) and low (300-1500m) elevations that isolate snow, mixed and rain-dominated precipitation regimes. Results indicate that lags between percentiles of precipitation and streamflow are much shorter in low elevations than in mid- and high-elevation watersheds. Low elevation annual percentiles (Q(25) and Q(75)) of streamflow occur 30-50days earlier than in higher elevation watersheds. Extreme events in low elevations are dominated by low- and no-flow events whereas mid- and high-elevation extreme events are primarily large magnitude floods. Only mid- and high-elevation watersheds are strongly cross correlated with catchment-wide flow of the Salmon River, suggesting that changes in contributions from low-elevation catchments may be poorly represented using mainstem gauges. As snowline rises, mid-elevation watersheds will likely exhibit behaviours currently observed only at lower elevations. Streamflow monitoring networks designed for operational decision making or change detection may require modification to capture elevation-dependent responses of streamflow to warming.

validation and sensitivity test of the distributed hydrology soil-vegetation model (dhsvm) in a forested mountain watershed,"Hydrologic models are often calibrated and validated with streamflow from a limited number of sites, whereas assessment of model performance with internal watershed data can be used to constrain the parameterization of physically based models to verify that specific hydrologic processes are being reasonably simulated. This is particularly important for improving the simulation accuracy of models used to evaluate potential hydrologic responses to land use and climate change. The distributed hydrology soil-vegetation model (DHSVM) was parameterized for the Mica Creek Experimental Watershed in northern Idaho. Performance was assessed based on measured streamflow from nested and paired watersheds, snowpack dynamics, soil moisture, and transpiration estimated from sap flux. In general, DHSVM effectively simulated snowpack dynamics, soil water content, and the streamflow regime. Streamflow simulation for seven subcatchments had model efficiencies ranging between 0.63 and 0.79. Model efficiency of snowpack simulation at a SNOTEL site was 0.95. Some minor discrepancies between simulated and measured values suggested that some processes, such as snow redistribution, were not represented by the model or were insufficiently parameterized for local conditions. A sensitivity analysis indicated that soil porosity, leaf area index, and minimum stomatal resistance were among the most influential parameters that affected variations in the simulated hydrological regime. However, those variables can be reasonably estimated based on field or remote sensing data. Other important parameters, such as saturated hydraulic conductivity, are more difficult to quantify and therefore need to be refined during the calibration phase. A description of the iterative parameter refinement process that was used in the calibration phase of the model is included to assist other researchers in refining model parameterizations.

sensitivity of snowpack storage to precipitation andtemperature using spatial and temporal analog models,"Empirical sensitivity analyses are important for evaluation of the effects of a changing climate on water resources and ecosystems. Although mechanistic models are commonly applied for evaluation of climate effects for snowmelt, empirical relationships provide a first-order validation of the various postulates required for their implementation. Previous studies of empirical sensitivity for April 1 snow water equivalent (SWE) in the western United States were developed by regressing interannual variations in SWE to winter precipitation and temperature. This offers a temporal analog for climate change, positing that a warmer future looks like warmer years. Spatial analogs are used to hypothesize that a warmer future may look like warmer places, and are frequently applied alternatives for complex processes, or states/metrics that show little interannual variability (e.g., forest cover). We contrast spatial and temporal analogs for sensitivity of April 1 SWE and the mean residence time of snow (SRT) using data from 524 Snowpack Telemetry (SNOTEL) stations across the western U.S. We built relatively strong models using spatial analogs to relate temperature and precipitation climatology to snowpack climatology (April 1 SWE, R-2=0.87, and SRT, R-2=0.81). Although the poorest temporal analog relationships were in areas showing the highest sensitivity to warming, spatial analog models showed consistent performance throughout the range of temperature and precipitation. Generally, slopes from the spatial relationships showed greater thermal sensitivity than the temporal analogs, and high elevation stations showed greater vulnerability using a spatial analog than shown in previous modeling and sensitivity studies. The spatial analog models provide a simple perspective to evaluate potential futures and may be useful in further evaluation of snowpack with warming."
early indicators of change: divergent climate envelopes between tree life stages imply range shifts in the western united states,"AimTo determine if differences in climate envelopes for six coniferous tree species and two life stages (trees and seedlings) suggest a potential for species range contractions, expansions or shifts in response to climate change and if these patterns differ between subalpine (i.e. cool-climate) and montane (i.e. warm-climate) species. LocationThe dry domain of the western United States. MethodsUsing data from the Forest Inventory and Analysis National Program, we quantified the relationship between probability of occurrence and climate for adults and seedlings of each species with a Bayesian logistic regression. Assuming that distributional differences between life stages highlight shifting regeneration patterns relative to adult trees, we assessed differences between seedlings and adult trees based on predicted probabilities of occurrence and climate envelope boundaries. ResultsDifferences between occurrence probabilities for seedlings and adults were greatest for montane, as opposed to subalpine, species and along range margins, especially in the southern and western portions of the study area. Climate envelope boundaries of seedlings differed from adult trees most frequently in montane species and often suggested range contractions or range shifts, as opposed to range expansion. Main conclusionsOur results indicated that climate-induced contractions and shifts in seedling distribution in response to recent change are already under way and are particularly severe in montane tree species. While adult trees may persist for hundreds of years without significant regeneration, tree species ranges will eventually contract where tree regeneration fails."
a 100-year conservation experiment: impacts on forest carbon stocks and fluxes,"Forest conservation is an important climate change mitigation strategy. National parks in Canada's Rocky and Purcell Mountains offer a rare opportunity to evaluate the impacts of a century of conservation on forest carbon (C) stocks and fluxes. We studied forest ecosystem C dynamics of three national parks in the Rocky and Purcell Mountains of British Columbia - Yoho, Kootenay, and Glacier National Parks - over the period 1970-2008 using the CBM-CFS3 inventory-based forest C budget model. We hypothesized that parks and protected areas would contain higher forest C density and have lower CO2 uptake rates compared to their surrounding reference areas because of the exclusion of timber harvesting and resulting predominance of older, slower growing forest stands. Results for Glacier National Park relative to its reference area were consistent with our hypothesis. Forests in Kootenay National Park were substantially younger than those in its reference area despite the exclusion of harvesting because natural disturbances affected large areas within the park over the past century. Site productivity in Kootenay National Park was also generally higher in the park than in its reference area. Consequently, Kootenay National Park had both higher C density and higher CO2 uptake than its reference area. Yoho National Park forests were similar in age to reference area forests and more productive, and therefore had both higher C stocks and greater CO2 uptake. C density was higher in all 3 parks compared to their surrounding areas, and parks with younger forests than reference areas had higher CO2 uptake. The results of this study indicate that forest conservation in protected areas such as national parks can preserve existing C stocks where natural disturbances are rare. Where natural disturbances are an important part of the forest ecology, conservation may or may not contribute to climate change mitigation because of the risk of C loss in the event of wildfire or insect-caused tree mortality. Anticipated increases in natural disturbance resulting from global warming may further reduce the climate change mitigation potential of forest conservation in disturbance-prone ecosystems. We show that managing for the ecological integrity of landscapes can also have carbon mitigation co-benefits. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"tree growth and climate in the pacific northwest, north america: a broad-scale analysis of changing growth environments","AimClimate change in the 21st century will affect tree growth in the Pacific Northwest region of North America, although complex climate-growth relationships make it difficult to identify how radial growth will respond across different species distributions. We used a novel method to examine potential growth responses to climate change at a broad geographical scale with a focus on visual inspection of patterns and applications beyond sampled areas. LocationWashington and Oregon, USA. MethodsWe examined projected changes in climate within species distributions of mountain hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana), subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) in Washington and Oregon based on three different future climate scenarios. By drawing on knowledge from previous climate-growth studies and organizing information into climate space plots, we inferred directional changes in future radial growth. ResultsIncreased moisture stress will reduce growth throughout the distribution of Douglas-fir, but growth may increase at some energy-limited locations. Decreased snowpack will increase growing season length and increase growth of subalpine fir and mountain hemlock at most locations, although growth may decrease at some low-elevation sites. Main conclusionsAn altered Pacific Northwest climate will elicit different growth responses from common conifer species within their current distributions. The methodology developed in this study allowed us to qualitatively extrapolate climate-growth relationships from individual sites to entire species distributions and can identify growth responses where climate-growth data are limited."
"impacts of dams on flow regimes in three headwater subbasins of the columbia river basin, united states","We compared long-term changes in flow regimes resulting from climate change with those resulting from dams in three matched pairs of natural and modified headwater subbasins of the Columbia River. Based on the analysis of 12 flow-regime metrics, we found that damming had minimal effect on most quantity of flow metrics, but major effect on timing of flow metrics, especially those representing ""spring runoff."" In all modified subbasins, ""spring runoff"" metrics occurred much earlier than natural flow (up to similar to 44 days earlier for April-July flows). Storage capacity modulated the magnitude of timing of flow-metric changes, with the largest storage capacity leading to the most change. However, even in subbasins with low storage capacity, we found significant change in most timing of flow metrics. We also found that damming, especially in subbasins with higher storage capacity, overwhelmed climate variability in all basins for most flow metrics. This shows that reservoir operations need to be modified to more closely match the natural timing of flow regimes to promote positive ecologic response in modified rivers, even in basins where quantity of flow metrics have not changed substantially as a result of damming."
"factors influencing legacy pollutant accumulation in alpine osprey: biology, topography, or melting glaciers?","Persistent: organic pollutants (POPs) can be transported long distances and deposited into alpine environments via cold trapping and snow scavenging processes. Here we examined biotic and abiotic factors determining contaminant variability of wildlife in alpine ecosystems. We measured POPs in eggs and plasma of an apex predator, the osprey (Pandion haliaetus) breeding in IS mountainous watersheds across a broad latitudinal, longitudinal and altitudinal range in western Canada. After accounting for proximate biotic factors such as trophic level (delta N-15) and carbon source (delta C-13), variability in contaminant concentrations, including Sigma DDT (sum of trichlorodiphenylethane-related compounds), toxaphene, hexachlorobenzene (HCB), total chlordane, and Sigma PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) in osprey tissues was explained by interactions among relative size of watersheds, water bodies, elevation, and glacial input. Sigma DDT in nestling plasma, for example, decreased with lake elevation, probably as a result of local past inputs from agricultural or public health usage at lower altitude sites. In contrast, toxaphene, never used as an insecticide in western Canada, increased with elevation and year-round snow and ice cover in both plasma and eggs, indicating long-range atmospheric sources as dominant for toxaphene. Lower chlorinated PCBs in plasma tended to decrease with elevation and ice cover consistent with published data and model outcomes. Temporal trends of POPs in osprey eggs are coincident with some modeled predictions of release from melting glaciers due to climate change. Currently we suggest that contaminants largely are released through annual snowpack melt and deposited in large lower elevation lakes, or some smaller lakes with poor drainage. Our study highlights the importance of understanding how biological processes integrate physical when studying the environmental chemistry of wildlife."
modeling lodgepole and jack pine vulnerability to mountain pine beetle expansion into the western canadian boreal forest,"The mountain pine beetle (MPB) (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) outbreak in western North America is the largest recorded in history, impacting over 14 million ha of pine forests in British Columbia alone. Large regions in western North America have become more favorable to the MPB, which has extended its range into higher elevations and more northerly latitudes, previously considered climatically unsuitable. Various investigators, and recent forest health surveys in Alberta have suggested that the beetle's range could shift further east on both lodgepole (Pinus contorta Dougl.) and jack pine (Pious banksiana Lamb.) into the boreal forest. A risk assessment of the threat of MPB to Canada's boreal forest identified effective monitoring and detection in areas vulnerable to infestation as the most critical information need. Changing climate may also be independently impacting pine forests, for instance through moisture stress. Species' vulnerability to climate change is reflected in modeled increases or decreases in the probability of its presence across its range. We hypothesize that areas within the current ranges of lodgepole and jack pine that have historically been sub-optimal for beetle expansion may become increasingly vulnerable as a result of climate change. In our analysis, we first test the ability of physiologically-based models to predict the recorded distributions of lodgepole and jack pine for 12,456 ground plots across British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan, using monthly climatic data derived for a calibration period between 1950 and 1975. Both the presence and absence of the two tree species recorded on survey plots were predicted, on average, with an accuracy of 85% for the calibration period. We then identified locations that appear to have become less suitable for these pine species in each subsequent year between 1976 and 2006 and found that the suitable range area for lodgepole and jack pine for > 50% of years in the period decreased by 45% and 40%, respectively. These results were compared with outputs from a climate-suitability model that identified areas of potential range expansion by MPB for two periods: 2001-2030 and 2010-2040. The area of vulnerable lodgepole pine forests that coincided with the area of potential beetle expansion was 40,000 km(2) in 2001-2030 and 45,000 km(2) in 2010-2040. The area of vulnerable jack pine was much less, ranging from 4000 to 8000 km(2) for the two periods. This analysis is unique in that it acknowledges the complexity of the beetle-host interaction by incorporating the potential impact of climate change on each of these elements into predictions of future host susceptibility to infestation. Such information is vital for assessing the ongoing risk of MPB range expansion and for designing future monitoring programs. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
a grid-based approach for simulating stream temperature,"Applications of grid-based systems are widespread in many areas of environmental analysis. In this study, the concept is adapted to the modeling of water temperature by integrating a macroscale hydrologic model, variable infiltration capacity (VIC), with a computationally efficient and accurate water temperature model. The hydrologic model has been applied to many river basins at scales from 0.0625 degrees to 1.0 degrees. The water temperature model, which uses a semi-Lagrangian numerical scheme to solve the one-dimensional, time-dependent equations for thermal energy balance in advective river systems, has been applied and tested on segmented river systems in the Pacific Northwest. The state-space structure of the water temperature model described in previous work is extended to include propagation of uncertainty. Model results focus on proof of concept by comparing statistics from a study of a test basin with results from other studies that have used either process models or statistical models to estimate water temperature. The results from this study compared favorably with those of selected case studies using data-driven statistical models. The results for deterministic process models of water temperature were generally better than the grid-based method, particularly for those models developed from site-specific, data-intensive studies. Biases in the results from the grid-based system are attributed to heterogeneity in hydraulic characteristics and the method of estimating headwater temperatures."
survival and population size of a resident bird species are declining as temperature increases,"1. A large number of migratory bird species appear to be declining as the result of climate change, but whether resident bird species have or will be adversely affected by climate change is less clear. We focus on the South Hills crossbill (Loxia curvirostra complex), which is endemic to about 70 km(2) of Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta latifolia) forest in southern Idaho, USA. 2. Our results indicate that the South Hills crossbill has declined by over 60% between 2003 and 2008, and that decreasing adult survival drives this population decline. 3. We evaluated the relative support for multiple hypotheses linking crossbill survival to climate, an ectoparasitic mite (scaly-leg mites Knemidokoptes jamaicensis), and the recent emergence of West Nile virus. Changes in adult apparent survival rate were closely associated with average spring and annual temperatures, and with high temperatures (>= 32 degrees C) during summer, which have increased during the last decade. In contrast, there was little evidence that scaly-leg mites or West Nile virus contributed to recent declines in adult survival. 4. The most probable mechanism causing the decline in adult survival and population size is a decrease in the availability of their primary food resource, seeds in serotinous pine cones. Cone production has declined with increasing annual temperatures, and these cones appear to be prematurely opening owing to increasingly hot summer conditions releasing their seeds and reducing the carrying capacity for crossbills later in the year. 5. In light of regional climate change forecasts, which include an increase in both annual temperature and hot days (>32 degrees C), and the likely disappearance of lodgepole pine from southern Idaho by the end of this century, additional research is needed to determine how to maintain lodgepole pine forests and their supply of seeds to conserve one of the few bird species endemic to the continental United States."
climate change could alter the distribution of mountain pine beetle outbreaks in western canada,"Climate change can markedly impact biology, population ecology, and spatial patterns of eruptive insects due to the direct influence of temperature on insect development and population success. The mountain pine beetle Dendroctonus ponderosae (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), is a landscape-altering insect that infests forests of North America. Abundant availability of host trees due to altered disturbance regimes has facilitated an unprecedented, landscape-wide outbreak of this pest in British Columbia and Alberta, Canada, during the past decade. A previous outbreak in the 1980s, in central British Columbia, collapsed due to host depletion and extreme cold weather events. Despite the importance of such extreme weather events and other temperature-related signals in modulating an outbreak, few landscape-level models have studied the associations of extreme cold events with outbreak occurrences. We studied the individual associations of several biologically-relevant cold temperature variables, and other temperature/degree-day terms, with outbreak occurrences in a spatial-temporal logistic regression model using data from the current outbreak. Timing, frequency, and duration of cold snaps had a severe negative association with occurrence of an outbreak in a given area. Large drops in temperature (>10 degrees C) or extreme winter minimum temperatures reduced the outbreak probability. We then used the model to apply eight different climate change scenarios to the peak year of the current outbreak. Our scenarios involved combinations of increasing annual temperature and different variances about this trend. Our goal was to examine how spatial outbreak pattern would have changed in the face of changing thermal regime if the underlying outbreak behaviour remained consistent. We demonstrate that increases in mean temperature by 1 degrees C to 4 degrees C profoundly increased the risk of outbreaks with effects first being manifested at higher elevations and then at increasing latitudes. However, increasing the variance associated with a mean temperature increase did not change the overall trend in outbreak potential."
enhanced sediment delivery in a changing climate in semi-arid mountain basins: implications for water resource management and aquatic habitat in the northern rocky mountains,"The delivery and transport of sediment through mountain rivers affects aquatic habitat and water resource infrastructure. While climate change is widely expected to produce significant changes in hydrology and stream temperature, the effects of climate change on sediment yield have received less attention. In the northern Rocky Mountains, we expect climate change to increase sediment yield primarily through changes in temperature and hydrology that promote vegetation disturbances (i.e., wildfire, insect/pathogen outbreak, drought-related die off). Here, we synthesize existing data from central Idaho to explore (1) how sediment yields are likely to respond to climate change in semi-arid basins influenced by wildfire, (2) the potential consequences for aquatic habitat and water resource infrastructure, and (3) prospects for mitigating sediment yields in forest basins. Recent climate-driven increases in the severity and extent of wildfire suggest that basin-scale sediment yields within the next few years to decades could be greater than the long-term average rate of 146 T km(-2) year(-1) observed for central Idaho. These elevated sediment yields will likely impact downstream reservoirs, which were designed under conditions of historically lower sediment yield. Episodic erosional events (massive debris flows) that dominate post-fire sediment yields are impractical to mitigate, leaving road restoration as the most viable management opportunity for offsetting climate-related increases in sediment yield. However, short-term sediment yields from experimental basins with roads are three orders of magnitude smaller than those from individual fire-related events (on the order of 10(1) T km(-2) year(-1) compared to 10(4)T km(-2)year(-1), respectively, for similar contributing areas), suggesting that road restoration would provide a relatively minor reduction in sediment loads at the basin-scale. Nevertheless, the ecologically damaging effects of fine sediment (material <6 mm) chronically produced from roads will require continued management efforts. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V."
simulations show decreasing carbon stocks and potential for carbon emissions in rocky mountain forests over the next century,"Climate change has altered the environment in which forests grow, and climate change models predict more severe alterations to come. Forests have already responded to these changes, and the future temperature and precipitation scenarios are of foremost concern, especially in the mountainous western United States, where forests occur in the dry environments that interface with grasslands. The objective of this study was to understand the trade-offs between temperature and water controls on these forested sites in the context of available climate projections. Three temperature and precipitation scenarios from IPCC AR4 AOGCMs ranging in precipitation levels were input to the process model Biome-BGC for key forested sites in the northern U. S. Rocky Mountains. Despite the omission of natural and human-caused disturbances in our simulations, our results show consequential effects from these conservative future temperature and precipitation scenarios. According to these projections, if future precipitation and temperatures are similar to or drier than the dry scenario depicted here, high-elevation forests on both the drier and wetter sites, which have in the absence of disturbance accumulated carbon, will reduce their carbon accumulation. Under the marginally drier climate projections, most forests became carbon sources by the end of the simulation horizon (2089). Under all three scenarios, growing season lengthened, the number of days with snow on the ground decreased, peak snow occurred earlier, and water stress increased through the projection horizon (1950-2089) for all sites, which represent the temperature and precipitation spectrum of forests in this region. The quantity, form, and timing of precipitation ultimately drive the carbon accumulation trajectory of forests in this region."
deep groundwater mediates streamflow response to climate warming in the oregon cascades,"Recent studies predict that projected climate change will lead to significant reductions in summer streamflow in the mountainous regions of the Western US. Hydrologic modeling directed at quantifying these potential changes has focused on the magnitude and timing of spring snowmelt as the key control on the spatial-temporal pattern of summer streamflow. We illustrate how spatial differences in groundwater dynamics can also play a significant role in determining streamflow responses to warming. We examine two contrasting watersheds, one located in the Western Cascades and the other in the High Cascades mountains of Oregon. We use both empirical analysis of streamflow data and physically based, spatially distributed modeling to disentangle the relative importance of multiple and interacting controls. In particular, we explore the extent to which differences in snow accumulation and melt and drainage characteristics (deep ground water vs. shallow subsurface) mediate the effect of climate change. Results show that within the Cascade Range, local variations in bedrock geology and concomitant differences in volume and seasonal fluxes of subsurface water will likely result in significant spatial variability in responses to climate forcing. Specifically, watersheds dominated by High Cascade geology will show greater absolute reductions in summer streamflow with predicted temperature increases."
assessing the restoration potential of altered rangeland ecosystems in the interior columbia basin,"This paper provides an overview of the current condition of several vegetation types within the Interior Columbia Basin (USA) and their prognosis for restoration and recovery. The projected environmental consequences for Forest Service- and Bureau of Land Management-managed rangelands and their associated animal species as expressed in the Supplemental Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Interior Columbia Basin Ecosystem Management Project are discussed. The five most prevalent causes of alteration of rangeland vegetation in the Basin are discussed, namely: introduction and spread of invasive species; livestock grazing; modified fire regimes; climatic change; and human presence (urbanization, agriculture, road development). Of the 17 dry grass, dry shrub and cool grass potential vegetation types identified in the Basin, six have been significantly altered, have a high restoration priority, and that significantly influence management of federal lands, These include: salt desert shrub, Wyoming big sage (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Artemisia tridentata</i> subsp. <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">wyomingensis</i>) warm, basin big sage steppe, mountain big sage mesic west, mountain big sage mesic west with juniper, and <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Agropyron</i> steppe."
spatial patterns of forest characteristics in the western united states derived from inventories,"In the western United States, forest ecosystems are subject to a variety of forcing mechanisms that drive dynamics, including climate change, land-use/land-cover change, atmospheric pollution, and disturbance. To understand the impacts of these stressors, it is crucial to develop assessments of forest properties to establish baselines, determine the extent of changes, and provide information to ecosystem modeling activities. Here we report on spatial patterns of characteristics of forest ecosystems in the western United States, including area, stand age, forest type, and carbon stocks, and comparisons of these patterns with those from satellite imagery and simulation models. The USDA Forest Service collected ground-based measurements of tree and plot information in recent decades as part of nationwide forest inventories. Using these measurements together with a methodology for estimating carbon stocks for each tree measured, we mapped county-level patterns across the western United States. Because forest ecosystem properties are often significantly different between hardwood and softwood species, we describe patterns of each. The stand age distribution peaked at 60 100 years across the region, with hardwoods typically younger than softwoods. Forest carbon density was highest along the coast region of northern California, Oregon, and Washington and lowest in the arid regions of the Southwest and along the edge of the Great Plains. These results quantify the spatial variability of forest characteristics important for understanding large-scale ecosystem processes and their controlling mechanisms. To illustrate other uses of the inventory-derived forest characteristics, we compared them against examples of independently derived estimates. Forest cover compared well with satellite-derived values when only productive stands were included in the inventory estimates. Forest types derived from satellite observations were similar to our inventory results, though the inventory database suggested more heterogeneity. Carbon stocks from the Century model were in good agreement with inventory results except in the Pacific Northwest and part of the Sierra Nevada, where it appears that harvesting and. re in the 20th century ( processes not included in the model runs) reduced measured stand ages and carbon stocks compared to simulations."
"significance of trends toward earlier snowmelt runoff, columbia and missouri basin headwaters, western united states","We assess changes in runoff timing over the last 55 years at 21 gages unaffected by human influences, in the headwaters of the Columbia-Missouri Rivers. Linear regression models and tests for significance that control for ""false discoveries'' of many tests, combined with a conceptual runoff response model, were used to examine the detailed structure of spring runoff timing. We conclude that only about one third of the gages exhibit significant trends with time but over half of the gages tested show significant relationships with discharge. Therefore, runoff timing is more significantly correlated with annual discharge than with time. This result differs from previous studies of runoff in the western USA that equate linear time trends to a response to global warming. Our results imply that predicting future snowmelt runoff in the northern Rockies will require linking climate mechanisms controlling precipitation, rather than projecting response to simple linear increases in temperature."
the structure of genetic diversity in engelmann spruce and a comparison with blue spruce,"Genetic diversity and genetic structure in Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii Parry ex Engelm.) were interpreted with respect to the effects of glacial and interglacial displacement and compared with patterns in blue spruce (Picea pungens Engelm.), which occupies a range well south of the last glacial front. On average, Engelmann spruce populations were polymorphic at 80% of 24 isozyme loci, with 2.4 alleles per locus and expected heterozygosity of 0.255. The respective means for four populations of blue spruce were 42.7%, 1.6 alleles, and 0.138. Of total diversity, 14.7% was among populations in Engelmann spruce and 8.6% in blue spruce. In Engelmann spruce, numbers of alleles increased from south to north. Recent bottlenecks were indicated in the three southernmost populations of Engelmann spruce and in the northernmost population of blue spruce. Cluster analysis divided Engelmann spruce into a northern group and a Southwestern group; however, populations from Utah were distributed among both clusters. Genetic distance was correlated with geographic distance between northern populations but not between Southwestern populations, where drift predominated over gene flow. In two Engelmann spruce populations from Utah, multilocus outcrossing rates were 0.951 (+/- 0.016) and 0.940 (+/- 0.071). At Flys Peak, Arizona, the southernmost location of Engelmann spruce, outcrossing was also high, 0.899 (+/- 0.017). Thus, inbreeding coefficients observed for parental (-0.104 to 0.047) and filial (0.011 to 0.026) generations were low. Although Engelmann spruce seemed genetically robust, the evidence of bottlenecks in the southern extreme of its range suggested future problems in an era of global warming."
development of scale-free climate data for western canada for use in resource management,"Applying climate data in resource management requires matching the spatial scale of the climate and resource databases. Interpolating climate data in mountainous regions is difficult. In this study, we present methodology to generate scale-free climate data through the combination of interpolation techniques and elevation adjustments. We apply it to monthly temperature and precipitation normals for 1961-90 produced by the Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) for British Columbia, Yukon Territories, the Alaska Panhandle, and parts of Alberta and the United States. Equations were developed to calculate biologically relevant climate variables including various degree-days, number of frost-free days, frost-free period, and snowfall from monthly temperature and precipitation data. Estimates of climate variables were validated using an independent dataset from weather stations that were not included in the development of the model. Weather station records generally agreed well with estimated climate variables and showed significant improvements over original PRISM climate data. A stand-alone MS Windows application was developed to perform all calculations and to integrate future climate predictions from various global circulation models. We demonstrate the use of this application by showing how climate change may affect lodgepole pine seed planning zones for reforestation in British Columbia.

downscaling simulations of future global climate with application to hydrologic modelling,"This study approaches the problem of downscaling global climate model simulations with an emphasis on validating and selecting global models. The downscaling method makes minimal, physically based corrections to the global simulation while preserving much of the statistics of interannual variability in the climate model. Differences among the downscaled results for simulations of present-day climate form a basis for model evaluation. The downscaled results are used to simulate streamflow in the Yakima River, a mountainous basin in Washington, USA, to illustrate how model differences affect streamflow simulations. The downscaling is applied to the output of three models (ECHAM4, HADCM3, and NCAR-PCM) for simulations of historic conditions (1900-2000) and two future emissions scenarios (A2 and B2 for 2000-2100) from the IPCC assessment. The ECHAM4 simulation closely reproduces the observed statistics of temperature and precipitation for the 42 year period 1949-90. Streamflow computed from this climate simulation likewise produces similar statistics to streamflow computed from the observed data. Downscaled climate-change scenarios from these models are examined in light of the differences in the present-day simulations. Streamflows simulated from the ECHAM4 results show the greatest sensitivity to climate change, with the peak in summertime flow occurring 2 months earlier by the end of the 21st century.

genetic consequences of forest population dynamics influenced by historic climatic variability in the western usa,"We review recent advances in climate science that show cyclic climatic variation over multiple time scales and give examples of the impacts of this variation on plant populations in the western USA. The paleohistorical reconstructions we review and others indicate that plant species track these cycles in individualistically complex ways. These dynamic histories suggest that genetic structures are in a non-equilibrium state, with populations constantly lagging their environmental optima. Such dynamism may serve to maintain genetic variation in populations, which may be a hedge against rapid environmental change. We also discuss how population history affects the way we analyze and interpret genetic data and, conversely, the way genetic theory affects historical reconstructions. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

mid-century ensemble regional climate change scenarios for the western united states,"To study the impacts of climate change on water resources in the western U. S., global climate simulations were produced using the National Center for Atmospheric Research/Department of Energy (NCAR/DOE) Parallel Climate Model (PCM). The Penn State/NCAR Mesoscale Model (MM5) was used to downscale the PCM control ( 20 years) and three future ( 2040 - 2060) climate simulations to yield ensemble regional climate simulations at 40 km spatial resolution for the western U. S. This paper describes the regional simulations and focuses on the hydroclimate conditions in the Columbia River Basin (CRB) and Sacramento- San Joaquin River (SSJ) Basin. Results based on global and regional simulations show that by mid-century, the average regional warming of 1 to 2.5 degreesC strongly affects snowpack in the western U. S. Along coastal mountains, reduction in annual snowpack was about 70% as indicated by the regional simulations. Besides changes in mean temperature, precipitation, and snowpack, cold season extreme daily precipitation increased by 5 to 15 mm/day (15 - 20%) along the Cascades and the Sierra. The warming resulted in increased rainfall at the expense of reduced snowfall, and reduced snow accumulation ( or earlier snowmelt) during the cold season. In the CRB, these changes were accompanied by more frequent rain-on-snow events. Overall, they induced higher likelihood of wintertime flooding and reduced runoff and soil moisture in the summer. Changes in surface water and energy budgets in the CRB and SSJ basin were affected mainly by changes in surface temperature, which were statistically significant at the 0.95 confidence level. Changes in precipitation, while spatially incoherent, were not statistically significant except for the drying trend during summer. Because snow and runoff are highly sensitive to spatial distributions of temperature and precipitation, this study shows that ( 1) downscaling provides more realistic estimates of hydrologic impacts in mountainous regions such as the western U. S., and ( 2) despite relatively small changes in temperature and precipitation, changes in snowpack and runoff can be much larger on monthly to seasonal time scales because the effects of temperature and precipitation are integrated over time and space through various surface hydrological and land-atmosphere feedback processes. Although the results reported in this study were derived from an ensemble of regional climate simulations driven by a global climate model that displays low climate sensitivity compared with most other models, climate change was found to significantly affect water resources in the western U. S. by the mid twenty-first century."
climate change and the outbreak ranges of two north american bark beetles,"1 One expected effect of global climate change on insect populations is a shift in geographical distributions toward higher latitudes and higher elevations. Southern pine beetle Dendroctonus frontalis and mountain pine beetle Dendroctonus ponderosae undergo regional outbreaks that result in large-scale disturbances to pine forests in the south-eastern and western United States, respectively. 2 Our objective was to investigate potential range shifts under climate change of outbreak areas for both bark beetle species and the areas of occurrence of the forest types susceptible to them. 3 To project range changes, we used discriminant function models that incorporated climatic variables. Models to project bark beetle ranges employed changed forest distributions as well as changes in climatic variables. 4 Projected outbreak areas for southern pine beetle increased with higher temperatures and generally shifted northward, as did the distributions of the southern pine forests. 5 Projected outbreak areas for mountain pine beetle decreased with increasing temperature and shifted toward higher elevation. That trend was mirrored in the projected distributions of pine forests in the region of the western U.S. encompassed by the study. 6 Projected outbreak areas for the two bark beetle species and the area of occurrence of western pine forests increased with more precipitation and decreased with less precipitation, whereas the area of occurrence of southern pine forests decreased slightly with increasing precipitation. 7 Predicted shifts of outbreak ranges for both bark beetle species followed general expectations for the effects of global climate change and reflected the underlying long-term distributional shifts of their host forests."
"assessment of climate change and freshwater ecosystems of the rocky mountains, usa and canada","The Rocky Mountains in the USA and Canada encompass the interior cordillera of western North America, from the southern Yukon to northern New Mexico. Annual weather patterns are cold in winter and mild in summer. Precipitation has high seasonal and interannual variation and may differ by an order of magnitude between geographically close locales, depending on slope, aspect and local climatic and orographic conditions. The region's hydrology is characterized by the accumulation of winter snow, spring snowmelt and autumnal baseflows. During the 2-3-month 'spring runoff period, rivers frequently discharge > 70% of their annual water budget and have instantaneous discharges 10-100 times mean low flow. Complex weather patterns characterized by high spatial and temporal variability make predictions of future conditions tenuous. However, general patterns are identifiable; northern and western portions of the region are dominated by maritime weather patterns from the North Pacific, central areas and eastern slopes are dominated by continental air masses and southern portions receive seasonally variable atmospheric circulation from the Pacific and the Gulf of Mexico. Significant interannual variations occur in these general patterns, possibly related to ENSO (El Nino-Southern Oscillation) forcing. Changes in precipitation and temperature regimes or patterns have significant potential effects on the distribution and abundance of plants and animals. For example, elevation of the timber-line is principally a function of temperature. Palaeolimnological investigations have shown significant shifts in phyto- and zoo-plankton populations as alpine lakes shift between being above or below the timber-line. Likewise, streamside vegetation has a significant effect on stream ecosystem structure and function. Changes in stream temperature regimes result in significant changes in community composition as a consequence of bioenergetic factors. Stenothermic species could be extirpated as appropriate thermal criteria disappear. Warming temperatures may geographically isolate cole water stream fishes in increasingly confined headwaters. The heat budgets of large lakes may be affected resulting in a change of state between dimictic and warm monomictic character. Uncertainties associated with prediction are increased by the planting of fish in historically fishless, high mountain lakes and the introduction of non-native species of fishes and invertebrates into often previously simple food-webs of large valley bottom lakes and streams. Many of the streams and rivers suffer from the anthropogenic effects of abstraction and regulation. Likewise, many of the large lakes receive nutrient loads from a growing human population. We concluded that: (1) regional climate models are required to resolve adequately the complexities of the high gradient landscapes; (2) extensive wilderness preserves and national park lands, so prevalent in the Rocky Mountain Region, provide sensitive areas for differentiation of anthropogenic effects from climate effects; and (3) future research should encompass both short-term intensive studies and long-term monitoring studies developed within comprehensive experimental arrays of streams and lakes specifically designed to address the issue of anthropogenic versus climatic effects.

snowmelt rate dictates streamflow,"Declining mountain snowpack and earlier snowmelt across the western United States has implications for downstream communities. We present a possible mechanism linking snowmelt rate and streamflow generation using a gridded implementation of the Budyko framework. We computed an ensemble of Budyko streamflow anomalies (BSAs) using Variable Infiltration Capacity model-simulated evapotranspiration, potential evapotranspiration, and estimated precipitation at 1/16 degrees resolution from 1950 to 2013. BSA was correlated with simulated baseflow efficiency (r(2)=0.64) and simulated snowmelt rate (r(2)=0.42). The strong correlation between snowmelt rate and baseflow efficiency (r(2)=0.73) links these relationships and supports a possible streamflow generation mechanism wherein greater snowmelt rates increase subsurface flow. Rapid snowmelt may thus bring the soil to field capacity, facilitating below-root zone percolation, streamflow, and a positive BSA. Previous works have shown that future increases in regional air temperature may lead to earlier, slower snowmelt and hence decreased streamflow production via the mechanism proposed by this work."
implications of climate change on wind erosion of agricultural lands in the columbia plateau,"Climate change may impact soil health and productivity as a result of accelerated or decelerated rates of erosion. Previous studies suggest a greater risk of wind erosion on arid and semi-arid lands due to loss of biomass under a future warmer climate. There have been no studies conducted to assess the impact of climate change on wind erosion in the Columbia Plateau of the Pacific Northwest United States where wind erosion of agricultural lands can cause exceedance of national air quality standards. The Wind Erosion Prediction System (WEPS) was used to assess wind erosion and PM10 (particulate matter ���������10 ������m in aerodynamic diameter) emissions under a future climate projected by downscaling 18 Global Climate Models (GCM) for a conservative emissions pathway. Wind erosion simulations were conducted at Lacrosse and Lind, WA and Moro, OR on a winter wheat-summer fallow (WW-SF) rotation and at Lind on an additional winter wheat-camelina-summer fallow (WW-Cam-SF) rotation. Each rotation was subject to conservation or conventional tillage practices for a baseline (1970-1999) and mid-21st century climate (2035-2064). A significant increase in temperature and nominal increases in precipitation were projected by an ensemble of climate models for the Columbia Plateau by the mid-21st century. Soil and PM10 losses were 25-84% lower for a mid-21st century climate, due in part to greater biomass production associated with CO<sub xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">2</sub> fertilization and warmer temperatures. The reduction in soil and PM10 loss is projected to be more apparent for conservation tillage practices in the future. Soil and PM10 losses were greater from a WW-Cam-SF rotation than WW-SF rotation when conservation tillage practices were employed during the fallow phase of the rotations. Despite accounting for differences in the length of each rotation, annual soil and PM10 losses remained higher for the WW-Cam-SF rotation than the WW-SF rotation. Soil and PM10 losses were more variable across years during 1970-1999 than 2035-2064; however, small and inconsistent differences in the coefficient of variation in soil loss between 1970-1999 and 2035-2064 suggest similarity in climate extremes which govern wind erosion."
scientific knowledge and knowledge needs in climate adaptation policy,"Mountain ecosystems around the world are recognized to be among the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The need to develop sound adaptation strategies in these areas is growing. Knowledge from the natural sciences has an important role to play in the development of adaptation strategies. However, the extent of and gaps in such knowledge have not been systematically investigated for mountain areas. This paper analyzes the status of knowledge from natural science disciplines and research needs relevant to the national and subnational climate adaptation policies of 1 US state (Washington) and 7 countries (Austria, Bhutan, Colombia, Germany, Nepal, Peru, and Switzerland), in particular the elements of those policies focused on mountain areas. In addition, we asked key individuals involved in drafting those policies to answer a short questionnaire. We found that research needs mainly concern impact and vulnerability assessments at regional and local levels, integrated assessments, and improved climate and socioeconomic data. These needs are often related to the challenges to data coverage and model performance in mountainous areas. In these areas, the base data are often riddled with gaps and uncertainties, making it particularly difficult to formulate adaptation strategies. In countries where data coverage is less of an issue, there is a tendency to explore quantitative forms of impact and vulnerability assessments. We highlight how the knowledge embedded in natural science disciplines is not always useful to address complex vulnerabilities in coupled human and natural systems and briefly refer to alternative pathways to adaptation in the form of no-regret, flexible, and adaptive management solutions. Finally, in recognition of the trans-and interdisciplinary nature of climate change adaptation, we raise the question of which knowledge production paradigms are best able to deliver sustainable adaptations to growing environmental stressors in mountain regions."
recent bark beetle outbreaks have little impact on streamflow in the western united states,"In the Western United States (US), the current mountain pine beetle (MPB; Dendroctonus ponderosae) epidemic has affected more than five million hectares since its start in 1996, including headwater catchments that supply water to much of the Western US. There is widespread concern that the hydrologic consequences of the extensive pine tree die-off will impact water supply across the Western US. While forest disturbance studies have shown that streamflow increases in response to tree harvest, the actual effect of bark beetle infestations on water supply remains widely debated. The current study evaluates watershed-level response following bark beetle outbreak for 33 watersheds in seven western states. Streamflow records were investigated to assess whether the timing and amount of stream discharge during bark beetle outbreak and early recovery periods were significantly different to pre-outbreak conditions. Results show no significant modification in peak flows or average daily streamflow following bark beetle infestation, and that climate variability may be a stronger driver of streamflow patterns and snowmelt timing than chronic forest disturbance."
"longitudinal changes in stream invertebrate assemblages of grand teton national park, wyoming","1. High elevation ecosystems are predicted to be strongly impacted by climate change; however, little is known of extant biodiversity in mountain streams. For this study, five streams in Grand Teton National Park, Wyoming were sampled along a longitudinal gradient to establish a baseline of invertebrate assemblages and environmental conditions. Five Surber samples were collected from low, middle and high elevation sites along each stream. 2. Nearly 10 000 ind m(-2) lived in these streams on average, but the density (mixed effects model, P = 0.54) and richness (P = 0.18) of invertebrates did not vary significantly by elevation. Total density of invertebrates was positively related to the amount of visible biofilm (ANOVA, P = 0.03) and oxidation-reduction potential (P = 0.05) and taxa richness was negatively related to specific conductivity (P = 0.009). 3. Invertebrate assemblages and environmental conditions were more similar at low versus high sites when compared using non-metric multidimensional scaling and tests of multivariate dispersion indicating that higher elevation sites harboured more environmental and species diversity. 4. These results can help target which aquatic invertebrates to monitor as stream temperatures rise, and highlight the biotic and abiotic factors that structure aquatic ecosystems in the Teton Range of Grand Teton National Park."
"low genetic diversity, restricted dispersal, and elevation-specific patterns of population decline in american pikas in an atypical environment","In the face of climate change, there is a growing need for research into the ability of organisms to persist at the limits of their bioclimatic envelope. American pikas (Ochotona princeps) have emerged as a focal mammalian species for investigating extinction risk related to climate change; however, most studies have occurred in characteristic alpine talus habitat within the range core. In the Columbia River Gorge (CRG), Oregon, American pikas inhabit low-elevation talus slopes previously considered outside the species' bioclimatic range. We used microsatellite genotypic data to reconstruct levels of genetic variation, population connectivity, and demographic history at 11 CRG sites spanning an elevational gradient (104-1,292 m). Sampled sites separated into 2 genetic clusters largely explained by elevation, topography, and geographic proximity, with pairwise estimates of differentiation and migration rates suggesting little gene flow may be occurring. Sites were characterized by levels of allelic richness and heterozygosity substantially lower than values reported at characteristic alpine sites from the range core. Evidence of recent demographic contraction was found almost exclusively at high-elevation sites despite these areas being considered refuges from climate warming in more typical habitat. Given their unique genetic characteristics and persistence in an atypical environment, the CRG pika populations likely constitute a significant component of intraspecific biodiversity with high conservation value."
climate change vulnerabilities and adaptation options for forest vegetation management in the northwestern usa,"Recent vulnerability assessments, conducted in diverse regions in the northwestern United States, indicate that many commonalities exist with respect to projected vulnerabilities to climate change. Dry forests are projected to have significant changes in distribution and abundance of species, partially in response to higher temperature and lower soil moisture, but mostly in response to projected increases in extreme events and disturbances-drought, wildfire, and insect outbreaks. Wildfire and mountain pine beetles have caused extensive mortality across millions of hectares in this region during the past decade, and wildfire area burned is projected to increase 200%-300% by mid-21st century. Science-management partnerships associated with recent assessments have identified an extensive list of adaptation options, including both strategies (general planning) and tactics (on-the-ground projects). Most of the options focus on increasing resilience to disturbances and on reducing current stressors to resource conditions. Adaptation options are generally similar across the biogeographically diverse region covered by assessments, suggesting that there may be a limit on the number of feasible responses to climate change. Federal agencies in the northwestern United States are now using these assessments and adaptation approaches to inform sustainable resource management and planning, mostly through fine tuning of existing practices and policies."
"complex challenges of maintaining whitebark pine in greater yellowstone under climate change: a call for innovative research, management, and policy approaches","Climate suitability is projected to decline for many subalpine species, raising questions about managing species under a deteriorating climate. Whitebark pine (WBP) (Pinus albicaulis) in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE) crystalizes the challenges that natural resource managers of many high mountain ecosystems will likely face in the coming decades. We review the system of interactions among climate, competitors, fire, bark beetles, white pine blister rust (Cronartium ribicola), and seed dispersers that make WBP especially vulnerable to climate change. A well-formulated interagency management strategy has been developed for WBP, but it has only been implemented across <1% of the species GYE range. The challenges of complex climate effects and land allocation constraints on WBP management raises questions regarding the efficacy of restoration efforts for WBP in GYE. We evaluate six ecological mechanisms by which WBP may remain viable under climate change: climate microrefugia, climate tolerances, release from competition, favorable fire regimes, seed production prior to beetle-induced mortality, and blister-rust resistant trees. These mechanisms suggest that WBP viability may be higher than previously expected under climate change. Additional research is warranted on these mechanisms, which may provide a basis for increased management effectiveness. This review is used as a basis for deriving recommendations for other subalpine species threatened by climate change."
assessing differences in snowmelt-dependent hydrologic projections using cmip3 and cmip5 climate forcing data for the western united states,"Most recent climate change impact studies are using Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) projections to replace older generation CMIP3 projections. Here we evaluate whether differences between projections based on comparable high emission pathways of a seven-member general circulation model CMIP3 versus CMIP5 ensemble change our understanding of the expected hydrologic impacts. This work focuses on the important snowmelt-dominated mountain runoff generating regions of the western United States (WUS; Upper Colorado River Basin (UCRB), Columbia River Basin (CRB), and Sierra Nevada (SN) Basins). Significant declines in snowmelt, and shifts in streamflow timing owing to warmer, wetter CMIP5 projections match or exceed those based on CMIP3 throughout the WUS. CMIP3- and CMIP5-based projections, while generally in agreement about hydroclimatic changes, differ in some important aspects for key regions. The most important is the UCRB, where CMIP5-based projections suggest increases in future streamflows. Comparable hydrologic projections result from similar underlying climate signals in CMIP3 and CMIP5 output for the CRB and SN, suggesting that previous work completed in these basins based on CMIP3 projections is likely still useful. However, UCRB hydrologic projections based on CMIP5 output suggest that a re-evaluation of future impacts on water resources is warranted."
"get real: climate change and all that ""it' entails","This article builds on Carolan's three natures scheme, where he distinguishes between the strata of nature', nature and Nature, by overlaying his previous framework with further analytic distinctions. Doing this, the authors argue, adds an important layer of analytical and conceptual robustness that his earlier scheme lacks. After building on this framework, attention turns to the phenomena of climate change. A selection of agrifood studies on this subject is used to help illustrate the utility of the revised model. The literatures reviewed involve the following: those looking at attitudes among farmers toward climate change; the bark beetle outbreaks in British Columbia; and food regimes. With this move the authors seek to illustrate the explanatory and descriptive utility of the revised model, specifically in its ability to provide a sustained defence of a type of realism that relational social theorists implicitly ascribe to. They also show how their conceptual labours - and the ecologically embedded relational realism it brings to the fore - can help further inform the aforementioned literatures by highlighting some of their conceptual and analytic blind spots."
projected major fire and vegetation changes in the pacific northwest of the conterminous united states under selected cmip5 climate futures,"Climate change adaptation and mitigation require understanding of vegetation response to climate change. Using the MC2 dynamic global vegetation model (DGVM) we simulate vegetation for the Northwest United States using results from 20 different Climate Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models downscaled using the MACA algorithm. Results were generated for representative concentration pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5 under vegetation modeling scenarios with and without fire suppression for a total of 80 model runs for future projections. For analysis, results were aggregated by three subregions: the Western Northwest (WNW), from the crest of the Cascade Mountains west; Northwest Plains and Plateau (NWPP), the non-mountainous areas east of the Cascade Mountains; and Eastern Northwest Mountains (ENWM), the mountainous areas east of the Cascade Mountains. In the WNW, mean fire interval (MFI) averaged over all climate projections decreases by up to 48%, and potential vegetation shifts from conifer to mixed forest under RCP 4.5 and 8.5 with and without fire suppression. In the NWPP MFI averaged over all climate projections decreases by up to 82% without fire suppression and increases by up to 14% with fire suppression resulting in woodier vegetation cover. In the ENWM, MFI averaged across all climate projections decreases by up to 81%, subalpine communities are lost, but conifer forests continue to dominate the subregion in the future.

snowpack sensitivity to perturbed climate in a cool mid-latitude mountain catchment,"There is great interest in ascertaining the degree of climate change necessary to induce substantial changes in snow accumulation and ablation processes in mountain headwater catchments. Therefore, the response of mountain snow hydrology to changes in air temperature and precipitation was examined by simulating a perturbed climate in Reynolds Mountain East (RME), a headwater catchment with a cool mountain climate in Idaho, USA. The cold regions hydrological model was used to calculate snow accumulation, wind redistribution by blowing snow, interception by forest canopies, sublimation and melt for 25 seasons in RME. The uncalibrated simulations of the highly redistributed snow water equivalent compared well to measurements. Results showed that with concomitant occurrence of warming (5 degrees C) and precipitation change (+/- 20%) in RME, the peak seasonal snow accumulation decreased by 84-90%, snowmelt decreased 51-79%, rainfall to total precipitation ratio increased from 30% to 78%, and overwinter blowing snow transport and sublimation losses from intercepted snow, the snow surface and blowing snow decreased dramatically. Warming causes an increase in inter-water year snowcover variability but a decrease in spatial snow accumulation variability. When warming exceeded 1 degrees C and a precipitation increased by less than 20%, the peak snow accumulation declined dramatically. The results contrast with those from further north along the North American Cordillera in Yukon, Canada, where the impacts of similar warming on alpine snow can be partly compensated for by concomitant increases in precipitation of less than 20%.

forest structure and species traits mediate projected recruitment declines in western us tree species,"AimDetermine if differences in the climatic niche between conspecific adult and juvenile trees of the western Unites States vary by species traits and to assess if forest canopies moderate the sensitivity of juvenile trees to climatic variation. LocationThe western Unites States. MethodsUsing data from the USDA Forest Inventory and Analysis programme, we compare the distribution of conspecific adult and juvenile trees for 62 western US tree species. We relate demographic niche differences to species traits including shade and drought tolerance. We model recruitment under projected climate change using generalized linear mixed models, probabilistic uncertainty accounting, forest structural data and projected changes in the climatic water balance. ResultsOn average juveniles of western US tree species occupy a climatic subset of their conspecific adults. Demographic niche differences increase as species shade and drought tolerance increase and are greatest at climatic range margins, indicating the potential for range contractions. Models calibrated solely with climate data project recruitment declines for 2080 that are 47% larger on average than models that also account for forest structure. Main conclusionsClimate change-driven declines in recruitment in western US tree species may be partly offset by the moderating effect of forest canopies. The importance of this stabilizing process will depend on whether a given site is disturbed and the traits of resident species, including their ability to utilize sites that have buffered microclimates. Conversely, our results suggest that broad-scale disturbances which result in the loss of forest canopy will amplify the effects of climate change on tree recruitment."
a model for mountain pine beetle outbreaks in an age-structured forest: predicting severity and outbreak-recovery cycle period,"The mountain pine beetle (MPB, <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Dendroctonus ponderosae</i>), a tree-killing bark beetle, has historically been part of the normal disturbance regime in lodgepole pine (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Pinus contorta</i>) forests. In recent years, warm winters and summers have allowed MPB populations to achieve synchronous emergence and successful attacks, resulting in widespread population outbreaks and resultant tree mortality across western North America. We develop an age-structured forest demographic model that incorporates temperature-dependent MPB infestations. Stability of fixed points is analyzed as a function of (thermally controlled) MPB population growth rates and indicates the existence of periodic outbreaks that intensify as growth rates increase. We devise analytical methods to predict outbreak severity and duration as well as outbreak return time. After incorporating a spatial aspect and controlling initial stand demographic variation, the model predicts cycle periods that fall within observed outbreak return time ranges. To assess future MPB impact on forests, we use climate model projected temperatures with our model-based approximation methods to predict potential severity of future outbreaks that reflect the effects of changing climate."
indicators of climate change in idaho: an assessment framework for coupling biophysical change and social perception,"Climate change is well documented at the global scale, but local and regional changes are not as well understood. Finer, local- to regional-scale information is needed for creating specific, place-based planning and adaption efforts. Here the development of an indicator-focused climate change assessment in Idaho is described. This interdisciplinary framework couples end users' data needs with observed, biophysical changes at local to regional scales. An online statewide survey of natural resource professionals was conducted to assess the perceived impacts from climate change and determine the biophysical data needed to measure those impacts. Changes to water resources and wildfire risk were the highest areas of concern among resource professionals. Guided by the survey results, 15 biophysical indicator datasets were summarized that included direct climate metrics (e.g., air temperature) and indicators only partially influenced by climate (e.g., wildfire). Quantitative changes in indicators were determined using time series analysis from 1975 to 2010. Indicators displayed trends of varying likelihood over the analysis period, including increasing growing-season length, increasing annual temperature, increasing forest area burned, changing mountain bluebird and lilac phenology, increasing precipitation intensity, earlier center of timing of streamflow, and decreased 1 April snowpack; changes in volumetric streamflow, salmon migration dates, and stream temperature displayed the least likelihood. A final conceptual framework derived from the social and biophysical data provides an interdisciplinary case example useful for consideration by others when choosing indicators at local to regional scales for climate change assessments."
life-stage-specific physiology defines invasion extent of a riverine fish,"Many ecologists have called for mechanism-based investigations to identify the underlying controls on species distributions. Understanding these controls can be especially useful to construct robust predictions of how a species range may change in response to climate change or the extent to which a non-native species may spread in novel environments. Here, we link spatially intensive observations with mechanistic models to illustrate how physiology determines the upstream extent of the aquatic ectotherm smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) in two headwater rivers. Our results demonstrate that as temperatures become increasingly cold across a downstream to upstream gradient, food consumption in age 0 bass becomes increasingly constrained, and as a result, these fish become growth limited. Sufficient first summer growth of age 0 bass is essential for overwinter survival because young bass must persist from energy reserves accumulated during the summer, and those reserves are determined by body size. Our field data reveal the upstream extent of adult bass reproduction corresponds to a point in the downstream/upstream gradient where cold temperatures impair growth opportunities in young bass. This pattern was repeated in both study streams and explained why bass positioned nests twice as far upstream in the warm compared to the cold stream in the same basin. Placement of spawning nests by adult bass is likely subject to strong evolutionary selection in temperate systems: if bass spawn too far upstream, their young are unlikely to grow large enough to survive the winter. Consumption and growth in older bass (age 3-4) was far less sensitive to temperature. Based on these data, we suggest that temperature-sensitive age 0 bass constrain the upstream distribution limits of bass within temperate streams. In this study, we investigated how temperature-dependent physiology changed through the life history of a species and, in doing so, identified a climate-sensitive life-history stage that likely sets the distributional limits of all other life-history stages. We anticipate the framework developed here could be employed to identify how similar stage-specific environmental sensitivity determines distribution in many other ectothermic species."
niche divergence of abies grandis-abies concolor hybrids,"Homoploid hybridization has increasingly been recognized as an important source of genetic variation to support adaptation to changing environmental conditions, the invasion of novel ecological niches and, ultimately, speciation. Although ecological selection pressures have been theorized to play a key role in the stabilization of homoploid hybrid lineages, surprisingly few detailed quantitative studies compare the realized ecological niches of hybrids and their progenitors. In this study, we compare twenty bioclimatic variables (Worldclim) at representative occurrence sites of Abies grandis, Abies concolor, and two classes of their natural hybrids, which are variably intergradient between their progenitors, to assess the potential role of ecological selection in the evolution of the observed morphological patterns of introgression. We find that both hybrid classes occupy distinct habitats that are variably intermediate between those associated with A. grandis and A. concolor for a majority of environmental variables, but with lower precipitation in the summertime in the southern Cascade, Siskiyou, and Sierra Nevada Mountains than associated with either progenitor. We hypothesize that moisture stress and high levels of solar insolation in the summertime associated with hybrid populations have played an important role in the observed patterns of introgression of key traits: leaf angle, specific leaf area, and abundance of adaxial stomates. Phenotypic plasticity in two of these traits may allow hybrids to adapt to an environment with a higher degree of variability in moisture stress. Moreover, in the context of moisture stress associated with predicted climate change, hybrids may have an adaptive advantage over A. grandis."
"hydrologic modeling using elevationally adjusted narr and narccap regional climate-model simulations: tucannon river, washington","An emerging approach to downscaling the projections from General Circulation Models (GCMs) to scales relevant for basin hydrology is to use output of GCMs to force higher-resolution Regional Climate Models (RCMs). With spatial resolution often in the tens of kilometers, however, even RCM output will likely fail to resolve local topography that may be climatically significant in high-relief basins. Here we develop and apply an approach for downscaling RCM output using local topographic lapse rates (empirically-estimated spatially and seasonally variable changes in climate variables with elevation). We calculate monthly local topographic lapse rates from the 800-m Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) dataset, which is based on regressions of observed climate against topographic variables. We then use these lapse rates to elevationally correct two sources of regional climate-model output: (1) the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR), a retrospective dataset produced from a regional forecasting model constrained by observations, and (2) a range of baseline climate scenarios from the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP), which is produced by a series of RCMs driven by GCMs. By running a calibrated and validated hydrologic model, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), using observed station data and elevationally-adjusted NARR and NARCCAP output, we are able to estimate the sensitivity of hydrologic modeling to the source of the input climate data. Topographic correction of regional climate-model data is a promising method for modeling the hydrology of mountainous basins for which no weather station datasets are available or for simulating hydrology under past or future climates.

"extinction debt in naturally contracting mountain meadows in the pacific northwest, usa: varying responses of plants and feeding guilds of nocturnal moths","Fire suppression and climate change are leading to habitat fragmentation in temperate montane meadows across the globe, raising concerns about biodiversity loss. Restoration strategies may depend on the rate and nature of species response to habitat loss. We examined the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on plants and nocturnal moths in natural montane meadows in the western Cascades, Oregon, USA, using generalized additive mixed models, non-metric multidimensional scaling, and multiple response permutation procedure. Historic (1949) rather than current (2005) meadow size explained species richness of herbaceous plants and herb-feeding moths and meadow plant community structure, indicating that loss of meadow species may be delayed by many decades following loss of meadow habitat, resulting in an extinction debt. In contrast, abundance of herb-feeding moths and species richness and abundance of woody plant-feeding moths were related to recent meadow configuration: as meadows are invaded by woody plants, abundance of meadow species declines, and woody plants and associated moths increase. Despite decades of fire suppression and climate change, montane meadows in many temperate mountain landscapes may still be amenable to restoration."
"forest as hazard, forest as victim: community perspectives and disaster mitigation in the aftermath of kelowna's 2003 wildfires","Situated within the political ecology of hazard, this article is an extended case study of the devastating 2003 wildfires in and around Kelowna, British Columbia (also known as the Okanagan Mountain Park Fire). This article reveals how compliance (or lack thereof) with fire mitigation strategies recommended by provincial, regional, and municipal agencies is complicated by differing social constructions of what constitutes ecologically sustainable forest management and community safety. Three perspectives emerge regarding the urban forests: ""nature as hazard""-a volatile force to be controlled; ""nature as instrumentally valuable""-a contribution to the character of one's surroundings and subsequent sense of place; and ""nature as intrinsically valuable""-a distinct entity to be preserved and protected for its own sake. The article also examines how experiences of disaster influence community perceptions and result in a greater willingness to engage in fire mitigation strategies due to perceptions of heightened vulnerability. Forestry and fire mitigation agencies need to determine multiple courses of action among the varied and valid range of residents' nature perspectives. The role of human agency in disaster mitigation must be examined, particularly as the risk of fire at the wildland-urban interface continues to be exacerbated by encroaching human settlements and climate change."
changing growth response to wildfire in old-growth ponderosa pine trees in montane forests of north central idaho,"North American fire-adapted forests are experiencing changes in fire frequency and climate. These novel conditions may alter postwildfire responses of fire-adapted trees that survive fires, a topic that has received little attention. Historical, frequent, low-intensity wildfire in many fire-adapted forests is generally thought to have a positive effect on the growth and vigor of trees that survive fires. Whether such positive effects can persist under current and future climate conditions is not known. Here, we evaluate long-term responses to recurrent 20th-century fires in ponderosa pine, a fire-adapted tree species, in unlogged forests in north central Idaho. We also examine short-term responses to individual 20th-century fires and evaluate whether these responses have changed over time and whether potential variability relates to climate variables and time since last fire. Growth responses were assessed by comparing tree-ring measurements from trees in stands burned repeatedly during the 20th century at roughly the historical fire frequency with trees in paired control stands that had not burned for at least 70 years. Contrary to expectations, only one site showed significant increases in long-term growth responses in burned stands compared with control stands. Short-term responses showed a trend of increasing negative effects of wildfire (reduced diameter growth in the burned stand compared with the control stand) in recent years that had drier winters and springs. There was no effect of time since the previous fire on growth responses to fire. The possible relationships of novel climate conditions with negative tree growth responses in trees that survive fire are discussed. A trend of negative growth responses to wildfire in old-growth forests could have important ramifications for forest productivity and carbon balance under future climate scenarios."
"the importance of seasonal temperature and moisture patterns on growth of douglas-fir in western oregon, usa","Douglas-fir growth in the Pacific Northwest is thought to be water limited. However, discerning the relative influence of air temperature and plant available soil water (W) on growth is difficult because they interact with each other, with other climate factors and with the inherent seasonal timing of cambial activity. Douglas-fir growth response to air temperature and W patterns during the growing season was examined using time series regression analysis of dendrometer data collected at approximately four-week intervals from 1998 through 2009. Five study sites were located in mature forest stands along an elevation gradient from the Pacific coast to the west slope of the Cascade Mountains (similar to 1200 m) in Oregon, USA. Maximum daily air temperature (T) and W were similar in relative importance to tree growth at four of the five sites. W was substantially more important at one site. Growth rate increased with T to an optimum (T-opt) and decreased with higher T. At the two drier sites T and W affected growth interactively in that T-opt decreased with decreasing W. We conclude that both T and W affect growth and that T consistently limits growth at three of the five sites and at all sites in years with above average summer temperature. Should climate change result in hotter summers in the region as predicted by climate models, we suggest that Douglas-fir will experience progressive temperature limitation.

glacier variability in the conterminous united states during the twentieth century,"Glaciers of the conterminous United States have been receding for the past century. Since 1900 the recession has varied from a 24 % loss in area (Mt. Rainier, Washington) to a 66 % loss in the Lewis Range of Montana. The rates of retreat are generally similar with a rapid loss in the early decades of the 20th century, slowing in the 1950s-1970s, and a resumption of rapid retreat starting in the 1990s. Decadal estimates of changes in glacier area for a subset of 31 glaciers from 1900 to 2000 are used to test a snow water equivalent model that is subsequently employed to examine the effects of temperature and precipitation variability on annual glacier area changes for these glaciers. Model results indicate that both winter precipitation and winter temperature have been important climatic factors affecting the variability of glacier variability during the 20th Century. Most of the glaciers analyzed appear to be more sensitive to temperature variability than to precipitation variability. However, precipitation variability is important, especially for high elevation glaciers. Additionally, glaciers with areas greater than 1 km(2) are highly sensitive to variability in temperature."
changes in blister rust infection and mortality in whitebark pine over time,"Whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis Engelm.), a keystone species in subalpine ecosystems of western North America, is under threat across its range from white pine blister rust, mountain pine beetle, fire exclusion, and climate change. Loss of whitebark pine is predicted to have cascading effects on many ecosystem services. We remeasured 115 whitebark pine plots in the Canadian Rocky Mountains to determine whether infection and mortality rates from blister rust were changing over time and (or) latitude. Average rust infection of trees among plots increased from 42% in 2003-2004 to 52% in 2009, while mortality increased from 18% to 28%. In eight plots that have been measured three times, infection increased from 43% of live trees in 1996 to 70% in 2003 and 78% in 2009. Mortality increased from 26% to 65% in the same time period. Overall, infection and mortality have increased 3%/year over the 13 years of the study. Incidence of infection and mortality was highest among plots in the southern part of the study area, particularly on the western side of the Continental Divide. The slowing rates of infection and mortality that we found suggest that some level of natural selection may already be occurring in areas with high levels of both."
hydrogeomorphic classification of washington state rivers to support emerging environmental flow management strategies,"As demand for fresh water increases in tandem with human population growth and a changing climate, the need to understand the ecological tradeoffs of flow regulation gains greater importance. Environmental classification is a first step towards quantifying these tradeoffs by creating the framework necessary for analysing the effects of flow variability on riverine biota. Our study presents a spatially explicit hydrogeomorphic classification of streams and rivers in Washington State, USA and investigates how projected climate change is likely to affect flow regimes in the future. We calculated 99 hydrologic metrics from 15?years of continuous daily discharge data for 64 gauges with negligible upstream impact, which were entered into a Bayesian mixture model to classify flow regimes into seven major classes described by their dominant flow source as follows: groundwater (GW), rainfall (RF), rain-with-snow (RS), snow-and-rain (SandR), snow-with-rain (SR), snowmelt (SM) and ultra-snowmelt (US). The largest class sizes were represented by the transitional RS and SandR classes (14 and 12 gauges, respectively), which are ubiquitous in temperate, mountainous landscapes found in Washington. We used a recursive partitioning algorithm and random forests to predict flow class based on a suite of environmental and climate variables. Overall classification success was 75%, and the model was used to predict normative flow classes at the reach scale for the entire state. Application of future climate change scenarios to the model inputs indicated shifts of varying magnitude from snow-dominated to rain-dominated flow classes. Lastly, a geomorphic classification was developed using a digital elevation model (DEM) and climatic data to assign stream segments as either dominantly able or unable to migrate, which was cross-tabulated with the flow types to produce a 14-tier hydrogeomorphic classification. The hydrogeomorphic classification provides a framework upon which empirical flow alterationecological response relationships can subsequently be developed using ecological information collected throughout the region.

frog population viability under present and future climate conditions: a bayesian state-space approach,"1. World-wide extinctions of amphibians are at the forefront of the biodiversity crisis, with climate change figuring prominently as a potential driver of continued amphibian decline. As in other taxa, changes in both the mean and variability of climate conditions may affect amphibian populations in complex, unpredictable ways. In western North America, climate models predict a reduced duration and extent of mountain snowpack and increased variability in precipitation, which may have consequences for amphibians inhabiting montane ecosystems. 2. We used Bayesian capturerecapture methods to estimate survival and transition probabilities in a high-elevation population of the Columbia spotted frog (Rana luteiventris) over 10 years and related these rates to interannual variation in peak snowpack. Then, we forecasted frog population growth and viability under a range of scenarios with varying levels of change in mean and variance in snowpack. 3. Over a range of future scenarios, changes in mean snowpack had a greater effect on viability than changes in the variance of snowpack, with forecasts largely predicting an increase in population viability. Population models based on snowpack during our study period predicted a declining population. 4. Although mean conditions were more important for viability than variance, for a given mean snowpack depth, increases in variability could change a population from increasing to decreasing. Therefore, the influence of changing climate variability on populations should be accounted for in predictive models. The Bayesian modelling framework allows for the explicit characterization of uncertainty in parameter estimates and ecological forecasts, and thus provides a natural approach for examining relative contributions of mean and variability in climatic variables to population dynamics. 5. Longevity and heterogeneous habitat may contribute to the potential for this amphibian species to be resilient to increased climatic variation, and shorter-lived species inhabiting homogeneous ecosystems may be more susceptible to increased variability in climate conditions."
evaluating the sufficiency of protected lands for maintaining wildlife population connectivity in the us. northern rocky mountains,"Aim The goal of this study was to evaluate the sufficiency of the network of protected lands in the U.S. northern Rocky Mountains in providing protection for habitat connectivity for 105 hypothetical organisms. A large proportion of the landscape falls into one of several categories of protected lands. However, protected lands in the region are primarily higher elevation forest and mountain habitats. Little is known about how the network of protected lands may maintain connectivity for a broad spectrum of species expressing different habitat requirements and dispersal abilities. Location The study was conducted across the states of Montana and northern Idaho, USA, comprising an area of 30.2 million hectares. Methods We used resistant kernel modelling to map the extent of the study area predicted to be connected by dispersal for each of 35 species groups with different ecological associations. We evaluated the effect of vagility on protected area sufficiency by varying dispersal ability across three levels for each species group. We evaluated the degree of vulnerability of each of the 105 hypothetical species (35 species groups x 3 dispersal abilities) in terms of the extent of the total study area predicted to be connected by dispersal. We defined nine categories of risk as the combination of species vulnerability because of the extent of connected habitat and the degree to which that habitat was protected. Results We found high variation in the vulnerability of species because of the extent of connected habitat, and the extent to which connected habitat overlapped protected lands. Species associated with high elevations and species associated with lower elevations were predicted to have limited extent of connected habitat. Species associated with high elevations were predicted to have the vast majority of their connected habitat protected by federal Forest Service and National Park Service lands. In contrast, species associated with lower elevations were poorly protected by the existing network of protected lands. Main conclusions Low elevation and non-forest habitats are at highest risk of human-induced habitat loss and fragmentation in the study area. Conservation efforts in the region may be most effective if they focus on expanding the network of lower elevation protected lands in such a way that maximizes connectivity across the landscape."
evolving while invading: rapid adaptive evolution in juvenile development time for a biological control organism colonizing a high-elevation environment,"We report evidence of adaptive evolution in juvenile development time on a decadal timescale for the cinnabar moth Tyria jacobaeae (Lepidoptera: Arctiidae) colonizing new habitats and hosts from the Willamette Valley to the Coast Range and Cascades Mountains in Oregon. Four lines of evidence reveal shorter egg to pupa juvenile development times evolved in the mountains, where cooler temperatures shorten the growing season: (i) field observations showed that the mountain populations have shorter phenological development; (ii) a common garden experiment revealed genetic determination of phenotypic differences in juvenile development time between Willamette Valley and mountain populations correlated with the growing season; (iii) a laboratory experiment rearing offspring from parental crosses within and between Willamette Valley and Cascades populations demonstrated polygenic inheritance, high heritability, and genetic determination of phenotypic differences in development times; and (iv) statistical tests that exclude random processes (founder effect, genetic drift) in favor of natural selection as explanations for observed differences in phenology. These results support the hypothesis that rapid adaptation to the cooler mountain climate occurred in populations established from populations in the warmer valley climate. Our findings should motivate regulators to require evaluation of evolutionary potential of candidate biological control organisms prior to release."
lapse rate adjustments of gridded surface temperature normals in an area of complex terrain: atmospheric reanalysis versus statistical up-sampling,"The applicability of elevation-regression based interpolation methods for long-term temperature normals, for example the Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM), becomes increasingly limited in data sparse, complex terrain such as that found in mountainous British Columbia (BC), Canada. Recent methods to improve both the resolution and accuracy of interpolation models have focused on the development of ""up-sampling"" algorithms based on local lapse rate adjustments to the original interpolated surfaces. Lapse rates can be derived from statistical models (e.g., elevation-based polynomial regression equations) or dynamical models (e.g., vertical temperature profiles from numerical weather prediction (NWP) models). This study compares a widely used statistical up-sampling algorithm, ClimateBC, with two NWP reanalysis products, the National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Corporation for Atmospheric Research, Reanalysis 1 (NCEP1) and the more modern European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis Interim (ERA-Interim). Thirty-year climate normals for maximum and minimum temperatures were calculated using statistical up-sampling and NWP lapse rate adjustments to existing PRISM-based climate normals at a subset of stations in BC. Specifically, up-sampling model evaluation was performed using 1951-80 climate normals from an independent set of 54 surface stations (1 m to 2347 m) which were not included in the PRISM interpolation or assimilated into the NWP reanalysis products. All models performed similarly for minimum temperature, which showed only a slight improvement over PRISM. For maximum temperature, ClimateBC, NCEP1 and ERA-Interim all performed significantly better than PRISM, in particular during spring and summer. The ERA-Interim reanalysis outperformed NCEP1 in almost all months. The results suggest that lapse rate adjustment algorithms based on reanalysis products will have greater potential as progress continues on developing NWP components."
population fragmentation and inter-ecosystem movements of grizzly bears in western canada and the northern united states,"Population fragmentation compromises population viability, reduces a species ability to respond to climate change, and ultimately may reduce biodiversity. We studied the current state and potential causes of fragmentation in grizzly bears over approximately 1,000,000 km(2) of western Canada, the northern United States (US), and southeast Alaska. We compiled much of our data from projects undertaken with a variety of research objectives including population estimation and trend, landscape fragmentation, habitat selection, vital rates, and response to human development. Our primary analytical techniques stemmed from genetic analysis of 3,134 bears, supplemented with radiotelemetry data from 792 bears. We used 15 locus microsatellite data coupled with measures of genetic distance, isolation-by-distance (IBD) analysis, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), linear multiple regression, multi-factorial correspondence analysis (to identify population divisions or fractures with no a priori assumption of group membership), and population-assignment methods to detect individual migrants between immediately adjacent areas. These data corroborated observations of inter-area movements from our telemetry database. In northern areas, we found a spatial genetic pattern of IBD, although there was evidence of natural fragmentation from the rugged heavily glaciated coast mountains of British Columbia (BC) and the Yukon. These results contrasted with the spatial pattern of fragmentation in more southern parts of their distribution. Near the Canada-US border area, we found extensive fragmentation that corresponded to settled mountain valleys and major highways. Genetic distances across developed valleys were elevated relative to those across undeveloped valleys in central and northern BC. In disturbed areas, most inter-area movements detected were made by male bears, with few female migrants identified. Northsouth movements within mountain ranges (Mts) and across BC Highway 3 were more common than eastwest movements across settled mountain valleys separating Mts. Our results suggest that relatively distinct subpopulations exist in this region, including the Cabinet, Selkirk South, and the decades-isolated Yellowstone populations. Current movement rates do not appear sufficient to consider the subpopulations we identify along the Canada-US border as 1 inter-breeding unit. Although we detected enough male movement to mediate gene flow, the current low rate of female movement detected among areas is insufficient to provide a demographic rescue effect between areas in the immediate future (0-15 yr). In Alberta, we found fragmentation corresponded to major eastwest highways (Highways 3, 11, 16, and 43) and most inter-area movements were made by males. Gene flow and movement rates between Alberta and BC were highest across the Continental Divide south of Highway 1 and north of Highway 16. In the central region between Highways 1 and 11, we found evidence of natural fragmentation associated with the extensive glaciers and icefields along the Continental Divide. The discontinuities that we identified would form appropriate boundaries for management units. We related sex-specific movement rates between adjacent areas to several metrics of human use (highway traffic, settlement, and human-caused mortality) to understand the causes of fragmentation. This analysis used data from 1,508 bears sampled over a 161,500-km(2) area in southeastern BC, western Alberta, northern Idaho, and northern Montana during 1979-2007. This area was bisected by numerous humantransportation and settlement corridors of varying intensity and complexity. We used multiple linear regression and ANCOVA to document the responses of female and male bears to disturbance. Males and females both demonstrated reduced movement rates with increasing settlement and traffic. However, females reduced their movement rates dramatically when settlement increased to >20% of the fracture zone. At this same threshold, male movement declined more gradually, in response to increased traffic and further settlement. In highly settled areas (>50%), both sexes had a similar reduction in movements in response to traffic, settlement, and mortality. We documented several small bear populations with male-only immigration, highlighting the importance of investigating sex-specific movements. Without female connectivity, small populations are not viable over the long term. The persistence of this regional female fragmented metapopulation likely will require strategic connectivity management. We therefore recommend enhancing female connectivity among fractured areas by securing linkage-zone habitat appropriate for female dispersal, and ensuring current large source subpopulations remain intact. The fragmentation we documented may also affect other species with similar ecological characteristics: sparse densities, slow reproduction, short male-biased dispersal, and a susceptibility to human-caused mortality and habitat degradation. Therefore, regional inter-jurisdictional efforts to manage broad landscapes for inter-area movement will likely benefit a broad spectrum of species and natural processes, particularly in light of climate change.

the influence of surface versus free-air decoupling on temperature trend patterns in the western united states,"We analyzed temperature trends from 460 GHCNv2 weather stations in the western United States for 1948-2006 to determine whether the extent of decoupling of surface temperatures from the free atmosphere influences past change. At each location we derived monthly indices representative of anticyclonicity using NCEP/NCAR 700 hPa reanalysis pressure fields. The number of anticyclonic days minus cyclonic days (A-C) is positively correlated with temperature anomalies at exposed convex sites and in the north of the domain where the free atmosphere controls temperature, anticyclonic months being warmer. In topographic concavities, and in the south of the domain where the influence of upper air ridges and troughs is muted, the relationship is much weaker. We use the gradient of the A-C index-temperature relationship to represent a coupling index, highest at exposed free-air locations. On a mean annual basis there are no strong relationships between temperature trend magnitude, elevation, topographic incision, or coupling index. However, in winter, warming is weaker at decoupled locations, especially when snow cover is present. Where snow is absent in winter, and in fall, the relationship is reversed. Circulation changes (increased cyclonicity) can explain the disparity in warming between decoupled and exposed locations in fall and to a certain extent in winter (increased anticyclonicity), although winter results are also regionally sensitive. Thus, future climate change may be different (amplified or muted dependent on season and/or surface characteristics) in locations prone to surface decoupling, compared with locations exposed to the free atmosphere. Understanding such processes will aid downscaling of future climate change."
recruitment limitation of long-lived conifers: implications for climate change responses,"Seed availability and suitable microsites for germination are likely to severely constrain the responses of plant species to climate change, especially at and beyond range edges. For example, range shifts may be slow if seed availability is low at range edges due to low parent-tree abundance or reduced fecundity. Even when seeds are available, climatic and biotic factors may further limit the availability of suitable microsites for recruitment. Unfortunately, the importance of seed and microsite limitation during range shifts remains unknown, since few studies have examined both factors simultaneously, particularly across species' ranges. To address this issue, we assessed seed availability and the factors influencing germination for six conifer species across a large environmental gradient encompassing their elevational ranges. Specifically, we assessed (1) how parent-tree abundance influences annual seed availability; (2) how seed limitation varies across species' ranges; (3) how climatic and biotic factors affect germination; and (4) how seed and suitable microsite availability covary annually within and among species. We found that seed availability declined toward species' upper range edges for most species, primarily due to low parent-tree abundance rather than declining fecundity. Range expansions are thus likely to be lagged with respect to climate change, as long generation times preclude rapid increases in tree density. Negative impacts of canopy cover on germination rates suggest range shifts will further be slowed by competition with existing vegetation. Moreover, years of high seed production were generally correlated among species, but not correlated with the availability of suitable microsites, implying that seedling competition and the interaction between seed and microsite limitation will further constrain recruitment. However, the nature of microsite limitation varied strongly between treeline and low-elevation species due to differing responses to snowpack duration and competition, suggesting that treeline species may be quicker to shift their ranges in response to warming than low-elevation species. In all, our results demonstrate that seed and microsite limitation will likely result in lagged responses to climate change but with differences among species leading to complex range shift dynamics."
conservation of caribou (rangifer tarandus) in canada: an uncertain future,"Caribou (Rangifer tarandus (L., 1758)) play a central role in the ecology and culture of much of Canada, where they were once the most abundant cervid. Most populations are currently declining, and some face extirpation. In southern Canada, caribou range has retreated considerably over the past century. The ultimate reason for their decline is habitat alterations by industrial activities. The proximate causes are predation and, to a lesser extent, overharvest. The most southerly populations of ""Mountain"" caribou are at imminent risk of extirpation. Mountain caribou are threatened by similar industrial activities as Boreal caribou, and face increasing harassment from motorized winter recreational activities. Most populations of ""Migratory Tundra"" caribou are currently declining. Although these caribou fluctuate in abundance over decades, changing harvest technologies, climate change, increasing industrial development and human presence in the North raise doubts over whether recent declines will be followed by recoveries. The Peary caribou (Rangifer tarandus pearyi J.A. Allen, 1902), a distinct subspecies endemic to Canada's High Arctic, has suffered drastic declines caused by severe weather, hunting and predation. It faces an increasing threat from climate change. While some questions remain about the reasons for the decline of Migratory Tundra caribou, research has clearly identified several threats to the persistence of ""Boreal"", Mountain, and Peary caribou. Scientific knowledge, however, has neither effectively influenced policies nor galvanized public opinion sufficiently to push governments into effective actions. The persistence of many caribou populations appears incompatible with the ongoing pace of industrial development."
mountain pine beetle host-range expansion threatens the boreal forest,"The current epidemic of the mountain pine beetle (MPB), an indigenous pest of western North American pine, has resulted in significant losses of lodgepole pine. The leading edge has reached Alberta where forest composition shifts from lodgepole to jack pine through a hybrid zone. The susceptibility of jack pine to MPB is a major concern, but there has been no evidence of host-range expansion, in part due to the difficulty in distinguishing the parentals and their hybrids. We tested the utility of a panel of microsatellite loci optimized for both species to classify lodgepole pine, jack pine and their hybrids using simulated data. We were able to accurately classify simulated individuals, and hence applied these markers to identify the ancestry of attacked trees. Here we show for the first time successful MPB attack in natural jack pine stands at the leading edge of the epidemic. This once unsuitable habitat is now a novel environment for MPB to exploit, a potential risk which could be exacerbated by further climate change. The consequences of host-range expansion for the vast boreal ecosystem could be significant."
"empirical modeling of spatial and temporal variation in warm season nocturnal air temperatures in two north idaho mountain ranges, usa","Accurate, fine spatial resolution predictions of surface air temperatures are critical for understanding many hydrologic and ecological processes. This study examines the spatial and temporal variability in nocturnal air temperatures across a mountainous region of Northern Idaho. Principal components analysis (PCA) was applied to a network of 70 Hobo temperature loggers systematically distributed across 2 mountain ranges. Four interpretable modes of variability were observed in average nighttime temperatures among Hobo sites: (1) regional/synoptic; (2) topoclimatic; (3) land surface feedback; (4) canopy cover and vegetation. PC time series captured temporal variability in nighttime temperatures and showed strong relationships with regional air temperatures, sky conditions and atmospheric pressure. PC2 captured the topographic variation among temperatures. A cold air drainage index was created by predicting PC2 loadings to elevation, slope position and dissection indices. Nightly temperature maps were produced by applying PC time series back to the PC2 loading surface, revealing complex temporal and spatial variation in nighttime temperatures. Further development of both physically and empirically based daily temperature models that account for synoptic atmospheric controls on fine-scale temperature variability in mountain ecosystems are needed to guide future monitoring efforts aimed at assessing the impact of climate change.

climate change and bark beetles of the western united states and canada: direct and indirect effects,"Climatic changes are predicted to significantly affect the frequency and severity of disturbances that shape forest ecosystems. We provide a synthesis of climate change effects on native bark beetles, important mortality agents of conifers in western North America. Because of differences in temperature-dependent life-history strategies, including cold-induced mortality and developmental timing, responses to warming will differ among and within bark beetle species. The success of bark beetle populations will also be influenced indirectly by the effects of climate on community associates and host-tree vigor, although little information is available to quantify these relationships. We used available population models and climate forecasts to explore the responses of two eruptive bark beetle species. Based on projected warming, increases in thermal regimes conducive to population success are predicted for Dendroctonus rufipennis (Kirby) and Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins, although there is considerable spatial and temporal variability. These predictions from population models suggest a movement of temperature suitability to higher latitudes and elevations and identify regions with a high potential for bark beetle outbreaks and associated tree mortality in the coming century."
decreased winter severity increases viability of a montane frog population,"Many proximate causes of global amphibian declines have been well documented, but the role that climate change has played and will play in this crisis remains ambiguous for many species. Breeding phenology and disease outbreaks have been associated with warming temperatures, but, to date, few studies have evaluated effects of climate change on individual vital rates and subsequent population dynamics of amphibians. We evaluated relationships among local climate variables, annual survival and fecundity, and population growth rates from a 9-year demographic study of Columbia spotted frogs (Rana luteiventris) in the Bitterroot Mountains of Montana. We documented an increase in survival and breeding probability as severity of winter decreased. Therefore, a warming climate with less severe winters is likely to promote population viability in this montane frog population. More generally, amphibians and other ectotherms inhabiting alpine or boreal habitats at or near their thermal ecological limits may benefit from the milder winters provided by a warming climate as long as suitable habitats remain intact. A more thorough understanding of how climate change is expected to benefit or harm amphibian populations at different latitudes and elevations is essential for determining the best strategies to conserve viable populations and allow for gene flow and shifts in geographic range."
downscaling hydroclimatic changes over the western us based on cam subgrid scheme and wrf regional climate simulations,"This study examines two dynamical downscaling methods, a subgrid parameterization and a regional climate model, to compare their impacts on simulating orographic precipitation and surface hydrology in mountain regions. A global climate model was first applied at 1 degrees x 1.25 degrees grid resolution with a subgrid orographic precipitation scheme. The global simulations were then used to drive a regional climate model at 15-km grid resolution over the Western United States. By comparing the global and regional simulations for two 10-year periods, 1993-2003 and 2039-2049, this study assesses the two downscaling methods in the context of simulating both the present climate and climate change signals. and the implications of the relatively short simulation length to investigate differences in current and future climate simulated by the models are discussed. The model results show that improving the representation of surface topography through higher spatial resolution or a subgrid method has a large impact on the simulations. Both the subgrid scheme and the regional model significantly improved the simulation of snowpack in the mountains. The spatial distributions of precipitation and snowpack are generally consistent between the subgrid and regional simulations, since they were driven by the same large-scale circulation from the global simulations. However, because rain-shadow effects are not represented in the subgrid scheme, the regional simulations produced much more realistic spatial variability in precipitation and snowpack than the subgrid simulations in narrow mountain ranges. In the climate change experiments, both downscaling procedures preserved the large-scale patterns of temperature and precipitation changes in the global simulations. However, the regional simulations show larger changes in precipitation and snowpack along the coastal mountains than the subgrid simulations. This is attributed to the fact that the regional model explicitly simulates the interactions of atmospheric circulation and the underlying topography, so changes in wind directions with respect to the orientations of the mountains may lead to changes in orographic precipitation that cannot he explained by changes in atmospheric temperature and moisture alone. Hence differences between the precipitation changes simulated by the regional model and the subgrid method are larger in narrow mountains such as the Cascades and the Sierra Nevada because the subgrid method does not account for the influence of mountain orientations at the subgrid scale. As precipitation is an important driver of surface hydrological processes, differences between the precipitation changes simulated by the two methods lead to important differences in the surface hydrological processes under climate change.

analysis of potential impacts of climate change on forests of the united states pacific northwest,"As global climate changes over the next century, forest productivity is expected to change as well. Using PRISM climate and productivity data measured on a grid of 3356 plots, we developed a simultaneous autoregressive (SAR) model to estimate the impacts of climate change on potential productivity of Pacific Northwest (PNW) forests of the United States. Productivity, measured by projected potential mean annual increment (PMAI) at culmination, is explained by the interaction of annual temperature, precipitation, and precipitation in excess of evapotranspiration through the growing season. By utilizing information regarding spatial error in the SAR model, the resulting spatial bias is reduced thereby improving the accuracy of the resulting maps. The model, coupled with climate change output from four generalized circulation models, was used to predict the productivity impacts of four different scenarios derived from the fourth IPCC special report on emissions, representing different future economic and environmental states of the world, viz., scenario A1B, A2, B1 (low growth, high economic development and low energy usage), and COMMIT. In these scenarios, regional average temperature is expected to increase from 0.5 to 4.5 degrees C, while precipitation shows no clear trend over time. For the west and east side of the Cascade Mountains, respectively, PMAI increases: 7% and 20% under A1B scenario: 8% and 23% under scenario A2; 5% and 15% under scenario B1, and 2% and 5% under the COMMIT scenario. These projections should be viewed as potential changes in productivity, since they do not reflect the mitigating effects of any shifts in management or public policy. For managers and policy makers, the results suggest the relative magnitude of effects and the potential variability of impacts across a range of climate scenarios. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

mycorrhizal networks and complex systems: contributions of soil ecology science to managing climate change effects in forested ecosystems,"Simard, S.W. 2009. Mycorrhizal networks and complex systems: Contributions of soil ecology science to managing climate change effects in forested ecosystems. Can. J. Soil Sci. 89: 369-382. Soil ecology science has contributed a rich understanding of natural soil patterns and processes, and played a role in revolutionizing the management of ecosystems. This basic understanding is also providing a foundation for predicting and managing the consequences of climate change on ecosystems, including their resilience to disturbance, biotic diversity, and carbon and nutrient dynamics. To help address the challenges of climate change, future soil ecology research and management would benefit from a complex systems approach, where network and dynamics systems theory are used to predict plant community and ecosystem responses to disturbance. A reductionist approach to management that ignores networks and system dynamics, by contrast, is destined to contribute to ecological degradation as climate changes. In this paper, I describe mycorrhizal networks as models of biological networks in the interior Douglas-fir forests of British Columbia, and the role they play in carbon flux and regeneration dynamics following disturbance. I propose a conservationist approach for managing forest mycorrhizal networks and hub trees that can facilitate native plant migrations, limit exotic plant invasions, and bolster ecological resilience. Interdisciplinary research that integrates the dynamics of multiple, overlapping networks will help develop management practices that sustain ecosystems in our changing climate."
precipitation and temperature estimation error at alpine treeline ecotones using the mountain climate simulator model (mt-clim),"In order to improve modeling of alpine treeline responses to climate change, estimations of snowfall at treeline sites are needed. The MT-CLIM climate model was evaluated for this purpose by extrapolating precipitation and temperature from standard weather stations at lower elevations to 30 alpine SNOTEL study sites across the western United States. Quantification of the topography between the base stations and the SNOTEL sites was used in inverse distance weighting and compared to straight-line weighting. The predicted temperature and precipitation under different weighting methods were compared to observed data over three months during the winter of 2006-2007. The errors were mapped and their spatial pattern analyzed. Error patterns indicate strong gradients, particularly in the Pacific Northwest, that are suggestive of areas where additional characteristics of atmosphere-land interactions and boundary layer climatology need to be considered in modeling applications."
synthesis of sediment yields after wildland fire in different rainfall regimes in the western united states,"Measurements of post-fire sediment erosion, transport, and deposition collected within 2 years of a wildfire were compiled from the published literature (1927-2007) for sites across the western United States. Annual post-fire sediment yields were computed and grouped into four measurement methods (hillslope point and plot measurements, channel measurements of suspended-sediment and sediment erosion or deposition volumes). Post-fire sediment yields for each method were then grouped into eight different rainfall regimes. Mean sediment yield from channels (240 t ha(-1)) was significantly greater than from hillslopes (82 t ha(-1)). This indicated that on the time scale of wildfire (10-100 years) channels were the primary sources of available sediment. A lack of correlation of sediment yield with topographic slope and soil erodibility further suggested that sediment availability may be more important than slope or soil erodibility in predicting post-fire sediment yields. The maximum post-fire sediment yields were comparable to long-term sediment yields from major rivers of the world. Based on 80 years of data from the literature, wildfires have been an important geomorphic agent of landscape change when linked with sufficient rainfall. These effects are limited in spatial scale to the immediate burned area and to downstream channel corridors."
decision support for evaluating landscape departure and prioritizing forest management activities in a changing environment,"We evaluated changes (hereafter, departures) in spatial patterns of various patch types of forested landscapes in two subwatersheds (""east"" and ""west"") in eastern Washington, USA, from the patterns of two sets of reference conditions; one representing the broad variability of pre-management era (similar to 1900) conditions, and another representing the broad variability associated with one possible warming and drying climate-change scenario. We used a diagnostic set of class and landscape spatial pattern metrics to compare current spatial patterns of test subwatersheds against the two sets of reference conditions. in a companion decision support model built with the EMDS modeling system, we considered the degree of departure in the subwatersheds, relative to the two sets of reference conditions along with two additional criteria (vulnerability to severe wildfire and timber harvest opportunity), to determine the relative priority of landscape restoration treatments, and the potential for timber harvest to underwrite the treatments. In the decision support model, the current spatial pattern conditions of physiognomic types, cover types, forest structural classes, and those of late-successional and old forest patches of the two subwatersheds were compared against the two sets of reference conditions. The degree of departure in spatial patterns of physiognomic conditions was moderate in both subwatersheds in the pre-management era and climate-change comparisons. The situation was similar for the cover-type departure analysis, but spatial patterns of cover types increased in similarity to the reference conditions in the western subwatershed under the climate-change scenario. Spatial patterns of structural conditions showed a high degree of departure in both subwatersheds when compared to either set of reference conditions, but similarity improved in the eastern subwatershed under the climate-change scenario. Spatial patterns of late-successional + old forest structure were strongly similar to the broad envelope of conditions represented by the pre-management era reference in the western and moderately similar in the eastern subwatershed, but declined in both subwatersheds when compared with the climate-change reference conditions. When the degree of departure in spatial patterns of all patch types was considered along with vulnerability to severe wildfire and timber harvest opportunity, the eastern subwatershed rated higher priority for landscape improvement using either set of reference conditions. We conclude by considering uncertainties inherent in the analysis approach, types of sensitivity analysis needed to investigate model performance, and broad implications for forest managers.

us forest service bark beetle research in the western united states: looking toward the future,"Bark beetles cause extensive tree mortality in coniferous forests of western North America and play an important role in the disturbance ecology of these ecosystems. Recently, elevated populations of bark beetles have been observed in all conifer forest types across the western United States. This has heightened public awareness of the issue and triggered legislation for increased funding for state and federal agencies to address issues associated with bark beetle outbreaks. Recently, US Forest Service, Research and Development entomologists from the western research stations met with US Forest Service, State and Private Forestry, Forest Health Protection entomologists, our primary stakeholder, to identify bark beetle research priorities. These include vegetation management; ecological, economic, and social consequences of outbreaks; fire and bark beetle interactions; effects of climate change on bark beetle populations; and chemical ecology."
douglas-fir growth in mountain ecosystems: water limits tree growth from stand to region,"The purpose of this work is to understand the nature of growth - climate relationships for Douglas-. r ( Pseudotsuga menziesii) across the climatic dimensions of its niche. We used a combination of biophysically informed sampling ( to identify sample sites) and dendroclimatology ( to identify growth - climate relationships) along a climate gradient in northwestern United States mountain ecosystems from the western Olympic Peninsula, Washington to the eastern Rocky Mountain Front, Montana. We used a multi- scale sampling strategy that accounted for continentality, physiography, and topography as non- climatic factors that could in. uence climate and alter tree growth. We developed a network of 124 Douglas-. r tree- ring chronologies and explored growth - climate correlations across the sampled gradients. We considered two different spatial scales of monthly and seasonal climate variables as potential controlling factors on tree growth. Annual radial growth in 60 - 65% of the plots across the region is signi. cantly correlated with precipitation, drought, or water balance during the late summer prior to growth and the early summer the year of growth. In a few plots, growth is positively correlated with cool- season temperature or negatively correlated with snowpack. Water availability is therefore more commonly limiting to Douglas-. r growth than energy limitations on growing season length. The. rst principal component derived from the chronologies is signi. cantly correlated with independent drought reconstructions. The sensitivity of Douglas-. r to summer water balance de. cit ( potential evapotranspiration minus actual evapotranspiration) indicates that increases in April to September temperature without increases in summer precipitation or soil moisture reserves are likely to cause decreases in growth over much of the sampled area, especially east of the Cascade crest. In contrast, Douglas-. r may exhibit growth increases at some higher elevation sites where seasonal photosynthesis is currently limited by growing- season length or low growing- season temperature. Life- history processes such as establishment, growth, and mortality are precursors to changes in biogeography, and measurements of climate effects on those processes can provide early indications of climate- change effects on ecosystems."
"past, present, and future old growth in frequent-fire conifer forests of the western united states","Old growth in the frequent-fire conifer forests of the western United States, such as those containing ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), Jeffrey pine (P. jeffreyi), giant sequoia (Sequioa giganteum) and other species, has undergone major changes since Euro-American settlement. Understanding past changes and anticipating future changes under different potential management scenarios are fundamental to developing ecologically based fuel reduction or ecological restoration treatments. Some of the many changes that have occurred in these forests include shifts from historically frequent surface fire to no fire or to stand-replacing fire regimes, increases in tree density, increased abundance of fire-intolerant trees, decreases in understory productivity, hydrological alterations, and accelerated mortality of old trees. Although these changes are widespread, the magnitude and causes of changes may vary within and among landscapes. Agents of change, such as fire exclusion or livestock grazing, likely interacted and had multiple effects. For example, historical ranching operations may have altered both fire regimes and understory vegetation, and facilitated institutional fire exclusion through fragmentation and settlement. Evidence exists for large variation in presettlement characteristics and current condition of old growth across this broad forest region, although there are many examples of striking similarities on widely distant landscapes. Exotic species, climate change, unnatural stand-replacing wildfires, and other factors will likely continue to degrade or eradicate old growth in many areas. As a policy of fire exclusion is proving to be unsustainable, mechanical tree thinning, prescribed fire, or wildland fire use will likely be key options for forestalling continued eradication of old growth by severe crown fires. For many practical and societal reasons, the wildland-urban interface may afford some of the most immediate opportunities for re-establishing old growth typical of presettlement forests resistant to crown fires."
empirical analyses of plant-climate relationships for the western united states,"The Random Forests multiple-regression tree was used to model climate profiles of 25 biotic communities of the western United States and nine of their constituent species. Analyses of the communities were based on a gridded sample of ca. 140,000 points, while those for the species used presence-absence data from ca. 120,000 locations. Independent variables included 35 simple expressions of temperature and precipitation and their interactions. Classification errors for community models averaged 19%, but the errors were reduced by half when adjusted for misalignment between geographic data sets. Errors of omission for species-specific models approached 0, while errors of commission were less than 9%. Mapped climate profiles of the species were in solid agreement with range maps. Climate variables of most importance for segregating the communities were those that generally differentiate maritime, continental, and monsoonal climates, while those of importance for predicting the occurrence of species varied among species but consistently implicated the periodicity of precipitation and temperature-precipitation interactions. Projections showed that unmitigated global warming should increase the abundance primarily of the montane forest and grassland community profiles at the expense largely of those of the subalpine, alpine, and tundra communities but also that of the arid woodlands. However, the climate of 47% of the future landscape may be extramural to contemporary community profiles. Effects projected on the spatial distribution of species-specific profiles were varied, but shifts in space and attitude would be extensive. Species-specific projections were not necessarily consistent with those of their communities."
variation in the relationship between snowmelt runoff in oregon and enso and pdo,"The value of using climate indices such as ENSO or PDO in water resources predictions is dependent on understanding the local relationship between these indices and streamflow over time. This study identifies long term seasonal and spatial variations in the strength of El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) correlations with timing and magnitude of discharge in snowmelt streams in Oregon. ENSO is best correlated with variability in annual discharge, and PDO is best correlated with spring snowmelt timing and magnitude and timing of annual floods. Streams in the Cascades and Wallowa mountains show the strongest correlations, while the southernmost stream is not correlated with ENSO or PDO. ENSO correlations are weaker from 1920 to 1950 and vary significantly depending on whether Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) or Nino 3.4 is used. PDO correlations are strong from 1920 to 1950 and weak or insignificant other years. Although there are not consistent increasing or decreasing trends in annual discharge or spring snowmelt timing, there are significant increases in fractional winter runoff that are independent of precipitation, PDO, or ENSO and may indicate monotonic winter warming."
effects of climate change on range expansion by the mountain pine beetle in british columbia,"The current latitudinal and elevational range of mountain pine beetle is not limited by available hosts. Instead, its potential to expand north and east has been restricted by climatic conditions unfavorable for brood development. We combined a model of the impact of climatic conditions on the establishment and persistence of mountain pine beetle populations with a spatially explicit, climate-driven simulation tool. Historic weather records were used to produce maps of the distribution of past climatically suitable habitats for mountain pine beetles in British Columbia. Overlays of annual mountain pine beetle occurrence on these maps were used to determine if the beetle has expanded its range in recent years due to changing climate. An examination of the distribution of climatically suitable habitats in 10-year increments derived from climate normals (1921-1950 to 1971-2000) clearly shows an increase in the range of benign habitats. Furthermore, an increase (at an increasing rate) in the number of infestations since 1970 in formerly climatically unsuitable habitats indicates that mountain pine beetle populations have expanded into these new areas. Given the rapid colonization by mountain pine beetles of former climatically unsuitable areas during the last several decades, continued warming in western North America associated with climate change will allow the beetle to further expand its range northward, eastward and toward higher elevations."
trends in temperature and precipitation in the pacific northwest during the twentieth century,"Documenting long-term trends or persistent shifts in temperature and precipitation is important for understanding present and future changes in flora and fauna. Carefully adjusted datasets for climate records in the USA and Canada are combined and used here to describe the spatial and seasonal variation in trends in the maritime, central, and Rocky Mountain climatic zones of the Pacific Northwest. Trends during the 20th century in annually averaged temperature (0.7degreesC-0.9degreesC) and precipitation (13%-38%) exceed the global averages. Largest warming rates occurred in the maritime zone and in winter and at lower elevations in all zones, and smallest warming rates occurred in autumn and in the Rockies. Largest increases in precipitation (upwards of 60% per century) were observed in the dry areas in northeast Washington and south central British Columbia. Increases in precipitation were largest in spring, but were also large in summer in the central and Rocky Mountain climatic zones. These trends have already had profound impacts on streamflow and on certain plant species in the region (Cayan et al. 2001), and other important impacts remain to be discovered. The warming observed in winter and spring can be attributed partially to climatic variations over the Pacific Ocean, and the buildup of greenhouse gases probably also plays an important role."
soil-surface carbon dioxide efflux and microbial biomass in relation to tree density 13 years after a stand replacing fire in a lodgepole pine ecosystem,"The effects of fire on soil-surface carbon dioxide (CO2 ) efflux, F (S) , and microbial biomass carbon, C (mic) , were studied in a wildland setting by examining 13-year-old postfire stands of lodgepole pine differing in tree density (< 500 to > 500 000 trees ha(-1) ) in Yellowstone National Park (YNP). In addition, young stands were compared to mature lodgepole pine stands (similar to110-year-old) in order to estimate ecosystem recovery 13 years after a stand replacing fire. Growing season F (S) increased with tree density in young stands (1.0 mumol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) in low-density stands, 1.8 mumol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) in moderate-density stands and 2.1 mumol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) in high-density stands) and with stand age (2.7 mumol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) in mature stands). Microbial biomass carbon in young stands did not differ with tree density and ranged from 0.2 to 0.5 mg C g(-1) dry soil over the growing season; C (mic) was significantly greater in mature stands (0.5-0.8 mg C g(-1) dry soil). Soil-surface CO2 efflux in young stands was correlated with biotic variables (above-ground, below-ground and microbial biomass), but not with abiotic variables (litter and mineral soil C and N content, bulk density and soil texture). Microbial biomass carbon was correlated with below-ground plant biomass and not with soil carbon and nitrogen, indicating that plant activity controls not only root respiration, but C (mic) pools and overall F (S) rates as well. These findings support recent studies that have demonstrated the prevailing importance of plants in controlling rates of F (S) and suggest that decomposition of older, recalcitrant soil C pools in this ecosystem is relatively unimportant 13 years after a stand replacing fire. Our results also indicate that realistic predictions and modeling of terrestrial C cycling must account for the variability in tree density and stand age that exists across the landscape as a result of natural disturbances."
"simulating effects of land use policies on extent of the wildland urban interface and wildfire risk in flathead county, montana","This study used a wildfire loss simulation model to evaluate how different land use policies are likely to influence wildfire risk in the wildland urban interface (WUI) for Flathead County, Montana. The model accounts for the complex socio-ecological interactions among climate change, economic growth, land use change and policy, homeowner mitigations, and forest treatments in Flathead County's WUI over the five 10-year subperiods comprising the future evaluation period (i.e., 2010-2059). Wildfire risk, defined as expected residential losses from wildfire [E(RLW)], depends on the number of residential properties on parcels, the probability that parcels burn, the probability of wildfire losses to residential structures on properties given the parcels on which those properties are located burn, the average percentage of wildfire-related losses in aesthetic values of residential properties, and the total value (structures plus land) of residential properties. E(RLW) for the five subperiods is simulated for 2010 (referred to as the current), moderately restrictive, and highly restrictive land use policy scenarios, a moderate economic growth scenario and the A2 greenhouse gas emissions scenario. Results demonstrate that increasingly restrictive land use policy for Flathead County significantly reduces the amount and footprint of future residential development in the WUI. In addition, shifting from the current to a moderately restrictive land use policy for Flathead County significantly reduces wildfire risk for the WUI, but shifting from the current to a highly restrictive land use policy does not significantly reduce wildfire risk in the WUI. Both the methods and results of the study can help land and wildfire managers to better manage future wildfire risk and identify residential areas having potentially high wildfire risk."
impacts of increased atmospheric co2 on the hydroclimate of the western united states,"Regional-scale projections of climate change signals due to increases in atmospheric CO2 are generated for the western United States using a regional climate model (RCM) nested within two global scenarios from a GCM. The downscaled control climate improved the local accuracy of the GCM results substantially. The downscaled control climate is reasonably close to the results of an 8-yr regional climate hindcast using the same RCM nested within the NCEP-NCAR reanalysis, despite wet biases in high-elevation regions along the Pacific coast. The downscaled near-surface temperature signal ranges from 3 to 5 K in the western United States. The projected warming signals generally increase with increasing elevation, consistent with earlier studies for the Swiss Alps and the northwestern United States. In addition to the snow-albedo feedback, seasonal variations of the low-level flow and soil moisture appear to play important roles in the spatial pattern of warming signals. Projected changes in precipitation characteristics are mainly associated with increased moisture fluxes from the Pacific Ocean and the increase in elevation of freezing levels during the cold season. Projected cold season precipitation increases substantially in mountainous areas along the Pacific Ocean. Most of the projected precipitation increase over the Sierra Nevada and the Cascades is in rainfall, while snowfall generally decreases except above 2500 m. Projected changes in summer rainfall are small. The snow budget signals are characterized by decreased (increased) cold season snowfall (snowmelt) and reduced snowmelt during spring and summer. The projected cold season runoff from high-elevation regions increases substantially in response to increased cold season rainfall and snowmelt, while the spring runoff decreases due to an earlier depletion of snow, except above 2500 m."
transferring soils from high- to low-elevation forests increases nitrogen cycling rates: climate change implications,"We assessed the potential impact of global warming resulting from a doubling of preindustrial atmospheric CO2 on soil net N transformations by transferring intact soil cores (0-15 cm) from a high-elevation old-growth forest to a forest about 800 m lower in elevation in the central Oregon Cascade Mountains, USA. The lower elevation site had mean annual air and soil (10-cm mineral soil depth) temperatures about 2.4 and 3.9 degrees C higher than the high-elevation site, respectively. Annual rates of soil net N mineralization and nitrification more than doubled in soil transferred to the low-elevation site (17.2-36.0 kg N ha(-1) and 5.0-10.7 kg NO3--N ha(-1), respectively). Leaching of inorganic N from the surface soil tin the absence of plant uptake) also increased. The reciprocal treatment (transferring soil cores from the low- to the high-elevation site) resulted in decreases of about 70, 80, and 65% in annual rates of net N mineralization, nitrification, and inorganic N leaching, respectively. Laboratory incubations of soils under conditions of similar temperature and soil water potential suggest that the quality of soil organic matter is higher at the high-elevation site. Similar in situ rates of soil net N transformations between the two sites occurred because the lower temperature counteracts the effects of greater substrate quantity and quality at the high elevation site. Our results support the hypothesis that high-elevation, old-growth forest soils in the central Cascades have higher C and N storage than their low-elevation analogues primarily because low temperatures limit net C and N mineralization rates at higher elevations."
"aftermath of mountain pine beetle outbreak in british columbia: stand dynamics, management response and ecosystem resilience","The mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) (MPB) has infested and killed millions of hectares of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia Engelm) forests in British Columbia, Canada, over the past decade. It is now spreading out of its native range into the Canadian boreal forest, with unknown social, economic and ecological consequences. This review explores the ramifications of the MPB epidemic with respect to mid-term timber supply, forest growth, structure and composition, vegetation diversity, forest fire, climate change, and ecosystem resilience. Research confirms that, in British Columbia, all of these variables are more significantly impacted when salvage logging is used as management response to the outbreak. We conclude that appropriate management in response to MPB is essential to ensuring ecologically resilient future forests and reliable mid-term timber supplies for affected human communities. We highlight knowledge gaps and avenues for research to advance our understanding in support of sustainable post-disturbance forest management policies in British Columbia and elsewhere."
"potential near-future carbon uptake overcomes losses from a large insect outbreak in british columbia, canada","The current capacity of northern high-latitude forests to sequester carbon has been suggested to be undermined by the potential increase in fire and insect outbreaks. Here we investigate the response of the terrestrial ecosystems in the province of British Columbia (BC), Canada, to the recent large mountain pine beetle (MPB) outbreak that started in 1999 as well as changing climate and continually increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration up to 2050, in a combined framework, using a process-based model. Model simulations suggest that the recent MPB outbreak results in BC's forests accumulating 328Tg less carbon over the 1999-2020 period. Over this same period changing climate and increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration, however, yield enhanced carbon uptake equal to a cumulative sink of around 900-1060TgC, depending on the future climate change scenario, indicating that the reduced carbon uptake by land due to the MPB disturbance may already be surpassed by 2020."
detectability of change in winter precipitation within mountain landscapes: spatial patterns and uncertainty,"Detecting long-term change in seasonal precipitation using ground observations is dependent on the representativity of the point measurement to the surrounding landscape. In mountainous regions, representativity can be poor and lead to large uncertainties in precipitation estimates at high elevations or in areas where observations are sparse. If the uncertainty in the estimate is large compared to the long-term shifts in precipitation, then the change will likely go undetected. In this analysis, we examine the minimum detectable change across mountainous terrain in western Montana, USA. We ask the question: What is the minimum amount of change that is necessary to be detected using our best estimates of precipitation in complex terrain? We evaluate the spatial uncertainty in the precipitation estimates by conditioning historic regional climate model simulations to ground observations using Bayesian inference. By using this uncertainty as a null hypothesis, we test for detectability across the study region. To provide context for the detectability calculations, we look at a range of future scenarios from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) multimodel ensemble downscaled to 4 km resolution using the MACAv2-METDATA data set. When using the ensemble averages we find that approximately 65% of the significant increases in winter precipitation go undetected at midelevations. At high elevation, approximately 75% of significant increases in winter precipitation are undetectable. Areas where change can be detected are largely controlled by topographic features. Elevation and aspect are key characteristics that determine whether or not changes in winter precipitation can be detected. Furthermore, we find that undetected increases in winter precipitation at high elevation will likely remain as snow under climate change scenarios. Therefore, there is potential for these areas to offset snowpack loss at lower elevations and confound the effects of climate change on water resources. Key Points: Changes in mountain winter precipitation may go undetected Areas of undetected change are largely controlled by topography Undetected precipitation changes may offset climate change effects on snow"
spatial models reveal the microclimatic buffering capacity of old-growth forests,"Climate change is predicted to cause widespread declines in biodiversity, but these predictions are derived from coarse-resolution climate models applied at global scales. Such models lack the capacity to incorporate microclimate variability, which is critical to biodiversity microrefugia. In forested montane regions, microclimate is thought to be influenced by combined effects of elevation, microtopography, and vegetation, but their relative effects at fine spatial scales are poorly known. We used boosted regression trees to model the spatial distribution of fine-scale, under-canopy air temperatures in mountainous terrain. Spatial models predicted observed independent test data well (r = 0.87). As expected, elevation strongly predicted temperatures, but vegetation and microtopography also exerted critical effects. Old-growth vegetation characteristics, measured using LiDAR (light detection and ranging), appeared to have an insulating effect; maximum spring monthly temperatures decreased by 2.5 degrees C across the observed gradient in old-growth structure. These cooling effects across a gradient in forest structure are of similar magnitude to 50-year forecasts of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and therefore have the potential to mitigate climate warming at local scales. Management strategies to conserve old-growth characteristics and to curb current rates of primary forest loss could maintain microrefugia, enhancing biodiversity persistence in mountainous systems under climate warming."
shifting ecological filters mediate postfire expansion of seedling aspen (populus tremuloides) in yellowstone,"Determining how ecological filters (e.g., climate, soils, biotic interactions) influence where species succeed in heterogeneous landscapes is challenging for long-lived species (e.g., trees), because filters can vary over space and change slowly through time. Stand-replacing wildfires create opportunities for establishment of tree-species cohorts and can catalyze rapid shifts in where species occur, facilitating unique opportunities for long-term study. We quantified effects of multiple ecological filters on a colonizing cohort of aspen (Populus tremuloides) that established from seed throughout burned lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia) forests after the 1988 fires in Yellowstone National Park (Wyoming, USA) to ask: (1) How have aspen presence, density, and size varied across the postfire landscape, and what filters explain these spatial and temporal patterns? (2) How does aspen above-and belowground biomass vary with postfire lodgepole-pine density? Aspen persisted to postfire year 25 in 58% of the plots in which aspen were present in postfire year 11 (n = 45), and mean stem density declined from 522 to 310 stems ha(-1). Mean aspen height doubled (from 29 to 59 cm) over this period. Ecological filters related to climate, competition, herbivory, and soils all differentially affected aspen presence, persistence, and size. Growing season temperature, inter-specific competition, and herbivory also changed through time, altering their effects on the colonizing cohort, and shifting where on the landscape aspen persistence and growth were ultimately favored. Eleven years postfire, aspen were favored at warmer, low elevations; ungulate browsing strongly constrained aspen heights; and competition was unimportant. By 25-years postfire, temperatures warmed nearly 1 degrees C, and aspen were more likely to persist at cooler, high elevations. Browsing pressure declined, as ungulate populations decreased during this time, but aspen height and basal diameters were constrained by dense, rapidly growing postfire conifers. Landscape mosaics of ecological filters shift over space and time and can facilitate or constrain the persistence and growth of colonizing species. Long-term study of post-disturbance colonizing cohorts uniquely reveal how species are responding to real-time environmental change in heterogeneous landscapes, which will help us better anticipate 21st century species distributions and abundances.

a forest vulnerability index based on drought and high temperatures,"Increasing forest stress and tree mortality has been directly linked to combinations of drought and high temperatures. The climatic changes expected during the next decades - large increases in mean temperature, increased heat waves, and significant long-term regional drying in the western USA - will likely increase chronic forest stress and mortality. The aim of this research is to develop and apply a new forest vulnerability index (FVI) associated with drought and high temperatures across the Pacific Northwest region (PNW; Oregon and Washington) of the USA during the MODIS Aqua era (since 2003). Our technique incorporates the alterations to canopy water and energy exchange processes caused by drought and high temperatures with spatially continuous MODIS land surface temperature (LST) and evapotranspiration (ET), and with Parameter-elevation Relationships on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) precipitation (P) data. With P and ET, we calculate a monthly water balance variable for each individual pixel normalized by forest type group (FTG), and then difference the water balance with the corresponding normalized monthly meanLST to calculate a monthly forest stress index (FSI). We then extract the pixel-specific (800-m resolution) statistically significant temporal trends of the FSI from 2003 to 2012 by month (April to October). The FVI is the slope of the monthly FSI across years, such that there is a FVI for each month. Statistically significant positive slopes indicate interannual increases in stress leading to expected forest vulnerability (positive FVI) for a given month. Positive FVI values were concentrated in the months of August and September, with peak vulnerability occurring at different times for different FTGs. Overall, increased vulnerability rates were the highest in drier FTGs such as Ponderosa Pine, Juniper, and Lodgepole Pine. Western Larch and Fir/Spruce/Mountain Hemlock groups occupy moister sites but also had relatively high proportion of positive FVI values. The Douglas-fir group had the second largest total area of increased vulnerability due to its large areal extent in the study area. Based on an analysis using imagery viewed in Google Earth, we confirm that areas with increased vulnerability are associated with greater amounts of stress and mortality. The FVI is a new way to conceptualize and monitor forest vulnerability based on first-order principles and has the potential to be generalized to other geographical areas. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

effects of increased soil water availability on grassland ecosystem carbon dioxide fluxes,"There is considerable interest in how ecosystems will respond to changes in precipitation. Alterations in rain and snowfall are expected to influence the spatio-temporal patterns of plant and soil processes that are controlled by soil moisture, and potentially, the amount of carbon (C) exchanged between the atmosphere and ecosystems. Because grasslands cover over one third of the terrestrial landscape, understanding controls on grassland C processes will be important to forecast how changes in precipitation regimes will influence the global C cycle. In this study we examined how irrigation affects carbon dioxide (CO<sub xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">2</sub>) fluxes in five widely variable grasslands of Yellowstone National Park during a year of approximately average growing season precipitation. We irrigated plots every 2 weeks with 25% of the monthly 30-year average of precipitation resulting in plots receiving approximately 150% of the usual growing season water in the form of rain and supplemented irrigation. Ecosystem CO<sub xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">2</sub> fluxes were measured with a closed chamber-system once a month from May-September on irrigated and unirrigated plots in each grassland. Soil moisture was closely associated with CO<sub xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">2</sub> fluxes and shoot biomass, and was between 1.6% and 11.5% higher at the irrigated plots (values from wettest to driest grassland) during times of measurements. When examining the effect of irrigation throughout the growing season (May-September) across sites, we found that water additions increased ecosystem CO<sub xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">2</sub> fluxes at the two driest and the wettest sites, suggesting that these sites were water-limited during the climatically average precipitation conditions of the 2005 growing season. In contrast, no consistent responses to irrigation were detected at the two sites with intermediate soil moisture. Thus, the ecosystem CO<sub xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">2</sub> fluxes at those sites were not water-limited, when considering their responses to supplemental water throughout the whole season. In contrast, when we explored how the effect of irrigation varied temporally, we found that irrigation increased ecosystem CO<sub xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">2</sub> fluxes at all the sites late in the growing season (September). The spatial differences in the response of ecosystem CO<sub xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">2</sub> fluxes to irrigation likely can be explained by site specific differences in soil and vegetation properties. The temporal effects likely were due to delayed plant senescence that promoted plant and soil activity later into the year. Our results suggest that in Yellowstone National Park, above-normal amounts of soil moisture will only stimulate CO<sub xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">2</sub> fluxes across a portion of the ecosystem. Thus, depending on the topographic location, grassland CO<sub xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">2</sub> fluxes can be water-limited or not. Such information is important to accurately predict how changes in precipitation/soil moisture will affect CO<sub xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">2</sub> dynamics and how they may feed back to the global C cycle."
weak effect of climate variability on coexistence in a sagebrush steppe community,"Climate variability, which is expected to increase in the future, can promote coexistence through a mechanism called the storage effect. Currently, we have little understanding of how the importance of the storage effect varies among ecosystems. We tested for the three conditions of the storage effect in a sagebrush steppe plant community in Idaho (USA) by combining long-term observational data with statistical models. The four sagebrush steppe species that we studied satisfied the first two conditions of the storage effect: a long-lived life stage and species-specific responses to the environment. But the critical third condition, environment-competition covariance, was very weak in this community. While the direction of the covariance was consistent with a stabilizing effect of variability (stronger competition in more favorable years), its magnitude was small, reflecting low temporal variability in both competition and species responses to the environment. Consistent with this result, simulations of species population growth rates when rare showed that climate variability had no consistent stabilizing effect on coexistence. This case study provides an important reminder that species-specific responses to the environment are not sufficient for coexistence via the storage effect. Instead, the magnitude of temporal variability in species performance also plays an important role. Comparison of our results with those from a similar study in Kansas mixed prairie suggests that temporal variability in species performance may reflect both the strength of environmental variability as well as life history strategies."
"climatic and biophysical controls on conifer species distributions in mountain forests of washington state, usa","Aim: The purpose of this study was to quantify relationships between conifer species distributions and climatic and biophysical variables, in order to provide better insight into the potential for redistribution of species on the landscape in response to climatic change. Location: Data are from 10,653 georeferenced sites in Washington State, USA, along a longitudinal gradient from west of the crest of the Cascade Range to the beginnings of the western slope of the Rocky Mountains, and across two physiographic provinces, the Northern Cascades, characterized by steep, rugged topography, and the Okanogan Highlands, presenting moderate slopes and broad rounded summits. Methods: Tree data were drawn from the USDA Forest Service Area Ecology Program database, collected in mature, undisturbed stands. We compared simple climatic variables (annual temperature, growing-degree days, annual and seasonal precipitation) to biophysical variables (soil, hydrologic, and solar radiation) derived from climatic variables. Climatic and biophysical variables were taken from the output of climatological and hydrological simulation models and estimated for each plot in the tree database. Generalized linear models were used, for each of fourteen tree species, at multiple spatial extents, to estimate the probability of occurrence of that species as a function of climatic and biophysical predictors. Models were validated by a combination of bootstrapping and estimating receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Results: For the majority of species, we were able to fit variables representing both moisture and temperature gradients, and in all but a few cases these models identified a unimodal response of species occurrence to these gradients. In some cases the ecological/environmental niche of a species had been clearly captured by the model, whereas in others a longer gradient in the predictor variable(s) would be needed. Responses of most species were consistent across three spatial scales. Main conclusions: By identifying the ecological niches of multiple species, we can forecast their redistribution on the landscape in response to climatic change, evaluate the predictions of simulation models, and alert managers to particularly sensitive or vulnerable ecosystems and landscapes."
impacts of postdam land use/land cover changes on modification of extreme precipitation in contrasting hydroclimate and terrain features,"Understanding the impact of postdam climate feedbacks, resulting from land use/land cover (LULC) variability, on modification of extreme precipitation (EP) remains a challenge for a twenty-first-century approach to dam design and operation. In this study, the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS, version 6.0) was used, involving a number of predefined LULC scenarios to address the important question regarding dams and their impoundments: How sensitive are the hydroclimatology and terrain features of a region in modulating the postdam response of climate feedbacks to EP? The study region covered the Owyhee Dam/Reservoir on the Owyhee River watershed (ORW), located in eastern Oregon. A systematic perturbation of the relative humidity in the initial and boundary condition of the model was carried out to simulate EP. Among the different LULC scenarios used in the simulation over the ORW, irrigation expansion in the postdam era resulted in an increase in EP up to 6% in the 72-h precipitation total. The contribution of the reservoir on EP added 8% to the 72-h total when compared to the predam LULC conditions. To address the science question, a previously completed investigation on the Folsom Dam [American River watershed (ARW)] in California was compared with the ORW findings on the basis of contrasting differences in hydroclimatology and terrain features. The results indicate that the postdam LULC change scenarios impact EP of ORW (Owyhee Dam) much greater than the EP of the ARW (Folsom Dam) because of its semiarid climate and flat terrain. EP was less sensitive to LULC changes on the windward side of the mountainous terrain of ARW as compared to the leeward side of the flat terrain of ORW."
opportunities to utilize traditional phenological knowledge to support adaptive management of social-ecological systems vulnerable to changes in climate and fire regimes,"The field of adaptive management has been embraced by researchers and managers in the United States as an approach to improve natural resource stewardship in the face of uncertainty and complex environmental problems. Integrating multiple knowledge sources and feedback mechanisms is an important step in this approach. Our objective is to contribute to the limited literature that describes the benefits of better integrating indigenous knowledge (IK) with other sources of knowledge in making adaptive-management decisions. Specifically, we advocate the integration of traditional phenological knowledge (TPK), a subset of IK, and highlight opportunities for this knowledge to support policy and practice of adaptive management with reference to policy and practice of adapting to uncharacteristic fire regimes and climate change in the western United States."
"alpine glaciers and permanent ice and snow patches in western canada approach their smallest sizes since the mid-holocene, consistent with global trends","<ca> Most alpine glaciers in the Northern Hemisphere reached their maximum extents of the Holocene between ad 1600 and 1850. Since the late 1800s, however, glaciers have thinned and retreated, mainly because of atmospheric warming. Glacier retreat in western Canada and other regions is exposing subfossil tree stumps, soils and plant detritus that, until recently, were beneath tens to hundreds of metres of ice. In addition, human artefacts and caribou dung are emerging from permanent snow patches many thousands of years after they were entombed. Dating of these materials indicates that many of these glaciers and snow patches are smaller today than at any time in the past several thousand years. This evidence, in turn, suggests that glacier recession in the 20th century is unprecedented during the past several millennia and that glaciers in western Canada have reached minimum extents only 150-300years after they achieved their maximum Holocene extents.

tracking interannual streamflow variability with drought indices in the us. pacific northwest,"Drought indices are often used for monitoring interannual variability in macroscale hydrology. However, the diversity of drought indices raises several issues: 1) which indices perform best and where; 2) does the incorporation of potential evapotranspiration (PET) in indices strengthen relationships, and how sensitive is the choice of PET methods to such results; 3) what additional value is added by using higher-spatial-resolution gridded climate layers; and 4) how have observed relationships changed through time. Standardized precipitation index, standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI), Palmer drought severity index, and water balance runoff (WBR) model output were correlated to water-year runoff for 21 unregulated drainage basins in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. SPEI and WBR with time scales encompassing the primary precipitation season maximized the explained variance in water-year runoff in most basins. Slightly stronger correlations were found using PET estimates from the Penman-Monteith method over the Thornthwaite method, particularly for time periods that incorporated the spring and summer months in basins that receive appreciable precipitation during the growing season. Indices computed using high-resolution climate surfaces explained over 10% more variability than metrics derived from coarser-resolution datasets. Increased correlation in the latter half of the study period was partially attributable to increased streamflow variability in recent decades as well as to improved climate data quality across the interior mountain watersheds."
extent of the rain-snow transition zone in the western us. under historic and projected climate,"This study investigates the extent of the rain-snow transition zone across the complex terrain of the western United States for both late 20th century climate and projected changes in climate by the mid-21st century. Observed and projected temperature and precipitation data at 4km resolution were used with an empirical probabilistic precipitation phase model to estimate and map the likelihood of snow versus rain occurrence. This approach identifies areas most likely to undergo precipitation phase change over the next half century. At broad scales, these projections indicate an average 30% decrease in areal extent of winter wet-day temperatures conducive to snowfall over the western United States. At higher resolution scales, this approach identifies existing and potential experimental sites best suited for research investigating the mechanisms linking precipitation phase change to a broad array of processes, such as shifts in rain-on-snow flood risk, timing of water resource availability, and ecosystem dynamics. Key Points * Projections map changes in precipitation phase across the western U.S. * Approximately 30% reduction by mid-21st century in the wintertime snow-dominated area * Annual duration of snowfall declining by ~2 months across mountain regions"
"catchment-scale modeling of nitrogen dynamics in a temperate forested watershed, oregon an interdisciplinary communication strategy","<ca> We present a systems modeling approach to the development of a place-based ecohydrological model. The conceptual model is calibrated to a variety of existing observations, taken in watershed 10 (WS10) at the HJ Andrews Experimental Forest (HJA) in Oregon, USA, a long term ecological research (LTER) site with a long history of catchment-scale data collection. The modeling framework was designed to help document and evaluate an evolving understanding of catchment processing of water, nitrogen, and carbon that has developed over the many years of on-going research at the site. We use the dynamic model to capture the temporal variation in the N and C budgets and to evaluate how different components of the complex system may control the retention and release of N in this pristine forested landscape. Results indicate that the relative roles of multiple competing controls on N change seasonally, between periods of wet/dry and growth/senescence. The model represents a communication strategy to facilitate dialog between disciplinary experimentalists and modelers, to produce a more complete picture of nitrogen cycling in the region. We view this explicit development of complete, yet conceptually simplified models as a useful and important way to evaluate complex environmental dynamics."
recent declines in western us. snowpack in the context of twentieth-century climate variability,"<ca> A monthly snow accumulation and melt model was used with monthly Precipitation-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) temperature and precipitation data to generate time series of 1 April snow water equivalent (SWE) for 1900 through 2008 in the western United States. Averaged across the western United States, SWE generally was higher than long-term (1900-2008) average conditions during the periods 1900-25, 1944-55, and 1966-82; SWE was lower than long-term average conditions during the periods 1926-43, 1957-65, and 1984-2008. During the period 1900-2008, the temporal pattern in winter precipitation exhibited wetter-than-average and drier-than-average decadal-scale periods with no long-term increasing or decreasing trend. Winter temperature generally was below average from 1900 to the mid-1950s, close to average from the mid-1950s to the mid-1980s, and above average from the mid-1980s to 2008. In general, periods of higher-than-average SWE have been associated with higher precipitation and lower temperature. Since about 1980, western U.S. winter temperatures have been consistently higher than long-term average values, and the resultant lower-than-average SWE values have been only partially offset by periods of higher-than-average precipitation. The post-1980 lower-than-average SWE conditions in the western United States are unprecedented within the context of twentieth-century climate and estimated SWE."
visualizing spatial heterogeneity of western us. climate variability,"<ca> Monthly climatologies (1971-2000 monthly averages) for stations in the western United States, obtained from the NOAA/National Climatic Data Center (NCDC), are used to illustrate the spatial variations in the annual cycle of climate. Animated map sequences of temperature and precipitation, their average, intermonthly changes, and the local timing of annual maxima or minima provide a comprehensive spatiotemporal baseline of regional climate. The animated maps illustrate three scales of variation: 1) broadscale patterns related to the annual cycle of insolation and hemispheric-scale atmospheric circulation features; 2) mesoscale patterns related to location on the continent and the influence of specific regional circulation features like those associated with the North American monsoon; and 3) smaller-scale spatial variations, related to the mediation by local physiography of the influence of large-scale circulation. Although most western U.S. stations have temperature maxima in July, a delay occurs at stations along the West Coast and interior Washington, northern Idaho, and Montana. A seesaw pattern of precipitation maxima is evident between coastal areas (winter dominated) and the interior (summer dominated). Cluster analyses of the ratio of monthly-to-annual precipitation values for each station identify regions with similar annual cycles of precipitation. Regions of high spatial heterogeneity in the timing of when precipitation occurs include the northern Rocky Mountains, Utah, Arizona, and northwestern Montana. The superimposition of these three scales of spatial variability leads to steep gradients and, in some regions, considerable spatial heterogeneity in annual precipitation. The regional patterns of precipitation heterogeneity highlight vulnerability to drought, especially in regions of the interior west that do not have a dominant precipitation month or season."
restoring fire-prone inland pacific landscapes: seven core principles,"Context More than a century of forest and fire management of Inland Pacific landscapes has transformed their successional and disturbance dynamics. Regional connectivity of many terrestrial and aquatic habitats is fragmented, flows of some ecological and physical processes have been altered in space and time, and the frequency, size and intensity of many disturbances that configure these habitats have been altered. Current efforts to address these impacts yield a small footprint in comparison to wildfires and insect outbreaks. Moreover, many current projects emphasize thinning and fuels reduction within individual forest stands, while overlooking large-scale habitat connectivity and disturbance flow issues. Methods We provide a framework for landscape restoration, offering seven principles. We discuss their implication for management, and illustrate their application with examples. Results Historical forests were spatially heterogeneous at multiple scales. Heterogeneity was the result of variability and interactions among native ecological patterns and processes, including successional and disturbance processes regulated by climatic and topographic drivers. Native flora and fauna were adapted to these conditions, which conferred a measure of resilience to variability in climate and recurrent contagious disturbances. Conclusions To restore key characteristics of this resilience to current landscapes, planning and management are needed at ecoregion, local landscape, successional patch, and tree neighborhood scales. Restoration that works effectively across ownerships and allocations will require active thinking about landscapes as socio-ecological systems that provide services to people within the finite capacities of ecosystems. We focus attention on landscape-level prescriptions as foundational to restoration planning and execution."
statistical comparisons of watershed-scale response to climate change in selected basins across the united states,"<ca> In an earlier global climate-change study, air temperature and precipitation data for the entire twenty-first century simulated from five general circulation models were used as input to precalibrated watershed models for 14 selected basins across the United States. Simulated daily streamflow and energy output from the watershed models were used to compute a range of statistics. With a side-by-side comparison of the statistical analyses for the 14 basins, regional climatic and hydrologic trends over the twenty-first century could be qualitatively identified. Low-flow statistics (95% exceedance, 7-day mean annual minimum, and summer mean monthly streamflow) decreased for almost all basins. Annual maximum daily streamflow also decreased in all the basins, except for all four basins in California and the Pacific Northwest. An analysis of the supply of available energy and water for the basins indicated that ratios of evaporation to precipitation and potential evapotranspiration to precipitation for most of the basins will increase. Probability density functions (PDFs) were developed to assess the uncertainty and multimodality in the impact of climate change on mean annual streamflow variability. Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests showed significant differences between the beginning and ending twenty-first-century PDFs for most of the basins, with the exception of four basins that are located in the western United States. Almost none of the basin PDFs were normally distributed, and two basins in the upper Midwest had PDFs that were extremely dispersed and skewed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]"
summertime climate response to mountain pine beetle disturbance in british columbia,"The present mountain pine beetle infestation in forests in British Columbia ranks among the largest ecological disturbances recorded in Canada so far. These recent outbreaks are thought to have been favoured by large-scale climatic shifts, and may foreshadow outbreaks of a similar magnitude in North American forests over the coming decades. The associated forest dieback could result in substantial shifts in evapotranspiration and albedo, thereby altering the local surface energy balance, and in turn regional temperature and climate. Here we quantify the impact of the Canadian pine beetle disturbance on the local summertime surface energy budget, using measurements of evapotranspiration, albedo and surface temperature, obtained primarily through remote sensing. We show that over the 170,000km super(2) of affected forest, the typical decrease in summertime evapotranspiration is 19%. Changes to the absorbed short-wave flux are negligible, in comparison. As a result, outgoing sensible and radiative heat fluxes increased by 8% and 1%, respectively, corresponding to a typical increase in surface temperature of 1 degree C. These changes are comparable to those observed for other types of disturbance, such as wildfire, and may have secondary consequences for climate, including modifications to circulation, cloud cover and precipitation."
"genetic responses to climate in <i xmlns=""http://wwww3.org/1999/xhtml"">pinus contorta</i>: niche breadth, climate change, and reforestation.","Twenty-year height and survival was analysed of 118 populations of two subspecies of <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Pinus contorta</i>, growing in common gardens at 60 environmentally disparate test sites in British Columbia. Response functions describing the height or survival of each population were developed from quadratic regressions using predicted climate variables for each test site. Mean annual temperature and mean temperature in the coldest month were the most effective variables for predicting population height, while the ratio of summer temperature to summer moisture best predicted survival. Results demonstrated that natural populations have different climatic optima but tend to occupy suboptimal environments. The response function predicts that small changes in climate will greatly affect growth and survival of forest tree populations and, therefore, that maintaining contemporary forest productivities during global warming will require a wholesale redistribution of genotypes across the landscape. The response functions also provide the climatic bases for current reforestation guidelines and quantify the adjustments necessary for maintaining adaptedness in planted trees during periods of small temporal temperature shifts."
interannual variations in snowpack in the crown of the continent ecosystem,"Ecosystem changes such as glacier recession and alpine treeline advance have been documented over the previous 150 years in the Rocky Mountains of northern Montana (USA) and southern British Columbia and Alberta (Canada), a region known as the Crown of the Continent Ecosystem (CCE). Such changes are controlled, at least partially, by variations in snowpack. The CCE consists primarily of public lands, the majority of which is undeveloped or wilderness. Consequently, this region is well suited for an examination of long-term snowpack variation and associated ecosystem change. Data from nine SNOTEL sites provide an indication of the daily accumulation and ablation of snowpack over the period 1977-2001, as well as the relationship between precipitation, temperature and snowpack. 1 April data from 21 snow courses indicated the extent of regional snowpack variation and trends over the period 1950-2001, and 1 May data from three snow courses in Glacier National Park allow this record to be extended back to 1922. SNOTEL data suggest CCE snowpacks are larger and more persistent than in most regions of the western USA, and that water year precipitation is the primary control on 1 April snow water equivalent (SWE). Snow course data indicate that variations in both 1 April and 1 May mean SWE are closely tied to the Pacific decadal oscillation, an El Ni������o-southern oscillation-like interdecadal pattern of Pacific Ocean climate variability. Despite relatively stable snowpacks and summer temperatures since 1922, the glaciers in Glacier National Park have receded steadily during this period, implying a significant climatic shift between their Little Ice Age glacial maxima (���������1860) and 1922."
flood quantiles in a changing climate: seasonal forecasts and causal relations,"Recognizing that the frequency distribution of annual maximum floods at a given location may change over time in response to interannual and longer climate fluctuations, we compare two approaches for the estimation of flood quantiles conditional on selected ""climate indices"" that carry the signal of structured low-frequency climate variation, and influence the atmospheric mechanisms that modify local precipitation and flood potential. A parametric quantile regression approach and a semiparametric local likelihood approach are compared using synthetic data sets and for data from a streamflow gauging station in the western United States. Their relative utility in different settings for seasonal flood risk forecasting as well as for the assessment of long-term variation in flood potential is discussed."
"assessing the past and future distribution and productivity of ponderosa pine in the pacific northwest using a process model, 3-pg","Climate variability at decadal scales influences not only the growth of widely distributed species such as <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Pinus ponderosa</i>, but also can have an effect on the timing and severity of fire and insect outbreaks that may alter species distributions. In this paper, we present a spatial modelling technique to assess the influence of climatic variability on the annual productivity of <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">P. ponderosa</i> in the Pacific Northwest (PNW) of North America over the past 100 years and infer how a sustained change in climate might alter the geographic distribution of this species across defined ecotones. Field observations were used to establish criteria for <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">P. ponderosa</i> dominance including: (1) maximum summer leaf area index (LAI), ranges between 1.5 and 2.5; (2) 80% of available soil water is depleted during summer months; and (3) soil water will return to full capacity at least once during the year. Where these three criteria were not met, eventual replacement of <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">P. ponderosa</i> would be predicted. We utilized a simple physiological model, Physiological Principles for Predicting Growth (3-PG) to predict annual variation in LAI from climatic data provided by the Oregon Climate Service over the period from 1900 to 2000 and from broad scale 0.5������-spatial resolution future climate projections produced by the Hadley Climate Center, UK. From these simulations we produced a series of maps that display predicted shifts of zones where ponderosa pine might be expected to contract or expand its range if modeled climatic conditions at annual and decadal intervals were sustained. From the historical simulations, the most favorable year for pine dominance was 1958 and the least favorable, 1924. The most favorable decade was in the 1900s and the least favorable in the 1930s. The future predictions indicate a reduction in the current range of the <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">P. ponderosa</i> type along the western Cascade Range however, an increase along the east side and inland PNW. The model predicts that pine dominance should increase between 5 and 10% over the next century, mainly in inland Oregon, Idaho, and Washington."
automated mapping of persistent ice and snow cover across the western us with landsat,"We implemented an automated approach for mapping persistent ice and snow cover (PISC) across the conterminous western U.S. using all available Landsat TM and ETM+ scenes acquired during the late summer/early fall period between 2010 and 2014. Two separate validation approaches indicate this dataset provides a more accurate representation of glacial ice and perennial snow cover for the region than either the U.S. glacier database derived from US Geological Survey (USGS) Digital Raster Graphics (DRG) maps (based on aerial photography primarily from the 1960s-1980s) or the National Land Cover Database 2011 perennial ice and snow cover class. Our 2010-2014 Landsat-derived dataset indicates 28% less glacier and perennial snow cover than the USGS DRG dataset. There are larger differences between the datasets in some regions, such as the Rocky Mountains of Northwest Wyoming and Southwest Montana, where the Landsat dataset indicates 54% less PISC area. Analysis of Landsat scenes from 1987-1988 and 2008-2010 for three regions using a more conventional, semi-automated approach indicates substantial decreases in glaciers and perennial snow cover that correlate with differences between PISC mapped by the USGS DRG dataset and the automated Landsat-derived dataset. This suggests that most of the differences in PISC between the USGS DRG and the Landsat-derived dataset can be attributed to decreases in PISC, as opposed to differences between mapping techniques. While the dataset produced by the automated Landsat mapping approach is not designed to serve as a conventional glacier inventory that provides glacier outlines and attribute information, it allows for an updated estimate of PISC for the conterminous U.S. as well as for smaller regions. Additionally, the new dataset highlights areas where decreases in PISC have been most significant over the past 25-50 years.

a two-parameter climate elasticity of streamflow index to assess climate change effects on annual streamflow,"This study extends the single parameter precipitation elasticity of streamflow index into a two parameter climate elasticity index, as a function of both precipitation and temperature, in order to assess climatic effects on annual streamflow. Application of the proposed index to two basins indicates that the single parameter precipitation elasticity index may give a general relationship between precipitation and streamflow in some cases, but that it cannot reflect the complicated non-linear relationship among streamflow, precipitation and temperature. For example, for the Spokane River basin the climate elasticity of streamflow index varies from 2.4 to 0.2, for a precipitation increase of 20%, as temperature varies from 1������C lower to 1.8������C higher than the long term mean. Thus a 20% precipitation increase may result in a streamflow increase of 48% if the temperature is 1������C lower but only a 4% increase if the temperature is 1.8������C higher than the long-term mean. The proposed method can be applied to other basins to assess potential climate change effects on annual streamflow. The results of the two case studies can inform planning of long-term basin water management strategies taking into account global change scenarios."
regional analysis of the impacts of climate change on cheatgrass invasion shows potential risk and opportunity,"Interactions between climate change and non-native invasive species may combine to increase invasion risk to native ecosystems. Changing climate creates risk as new terrain becomes climatically suitable for invasion. However, climate change may also create opportunities for ecosystem restoration on invaded lands that become climatically unsuitable for invasive species. Here, I develop a bioclimatic envelope model for cheatgrass (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Bromus tectorum</i>), a non-native invasive grass in the western US, based on its invaded distribution. The bioclimatic envelope model is based on the Mahalanobis distance using the climate variables that best constrain the species' distribution. Of the precipitation and temperature variables measured, the best predictors of cheatgrass are summer, annual, and spring precipitation, followed by winter temperature. I perform a sensitivity analysis on potential cheatgrass distributions using the projections of 10 commonly used atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs) for 2100. The AOGCM projections for precipitation vary considerably, increasing uncertainty in the assessment of invasion risk. Decreased precipitation, particularly in the summer, causes an expansion of suitable land area by up to 45%, elevating invasion risk in parts of Montana, Wyoming, Utah, and Colorado. Conversely, increased precipitation reduces habitat by as much as 70%, decreasing invasion risk. The strong influence of precipitation conditions on this species' distribution suggests that relying on temperature change alone to project future change in plant distributions may be inadequate. A sensitivity analysis provides a framework for identifying key climate variables that may limit invasion, and for assessing invasion risk and restoration opportunities with climate change."
local-scale validation of the surface observation gridding system with weather observations in a semi-arid environment,"Although the Surface Observation Gridding System (SOGS) provides spatially continuous models of meteorological conditions, little work has been done to validate SOGS data independently for site-specific research and, as a result, a single nearby weather station is commonly selected instead. This study sought to determine local-scale accuracy of SOGS data (1) by correlation with independent, <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">in situ</i> weather station measurements and (2) relative to a nearby weather station. Correlations between SOGS data and <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">in situ</i> weather observations and between <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">in situ</i> weather observations and a nearby weather station were examined in a semi-arid environment of southeastern Idaho over the 2006 growing season. The results indicate that both SOGS and nearby weather station data were significantly correlated with <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">in situ</i> weather station measurements. Although temperature correlations between <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">in situ</i> and the nearby weather station were slightly greater compared to SOGS, SOGS data were a better predictor of precipitation. This suggests that the use of a nearby weather station is appropriate for local temperature parameters but precipitation parameters are better estimated using SOGS data. Overall, the validation of the SOGS weather models agreed closely with independent, <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">in situ</i> weather measurements and, as a result, greater confidence can be placed in the accuracy of the productivity, biomass and global climate change models derived from these data."
"modeling amphibian energetics, habitat suitability, and movements of western
toads, anaxyrus (=bufo) boreas, across present and future landscapes","Effective conservation of amphibian populations requires the prediction of how amphibians use and move through a landscape. Amphibians are closely coupled to their physical environment. Thus an approach that uses the physiological attributes of amphibians, together with knowledge of their natural history, should be helpful. We used Niche Mapper<sup xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">TM</sup> to model the known movements and habitat use patterns of a population of Western toads (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Anaxyrus</i> (=<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Bufo</i>) <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">boreas</i>) occupying forested habitats in southeastern Idaho. Niche Mapper uses first principles of environmental biophysics to combine features of topography, climate, land cover, and animal features to model microclimates and animal physiology and behavior across landscapes. Niche Mapper reproduced core body temperatures (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">T</i><sub xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml""><i>c</i></sub>) and evaporation rates of live toads with average errors of 1.6������0.4������C and 0.8������0.2 g/h, respectively. For four different habitat types, it reproduced similar mid-summer daily temperature patterns as those measured in the field and calculated evaporation rates (g/h) with an average error rate of 7.2������5.5%. Sensitivity analyses indicate these errors do not significantly affect estimates of food consumption or activity. Using Niche Mapper we predicted the daily habitats used by free-ranging toads; our accuracy for female toads was greater than for male toads (74.2������6.8% and 53.6������15.8%, respectively), reflecting the stronger patterns of habitat selection among females. Using these changing to construct a cost surface, we also reconstructed movement paths that were consistent with field observations. The effect of climate warming on toads depends on the interaction of temperature and atmospheric moisture. If climate change occurs as predicted, results from Niche Mapper suggests that climate warming will increase the physiological cost of landscapes thereby limiting the activity for toads in different habitats."
comparison of growth and stress in resident redband trout held in laboratory simulations of montane and desert summer temperature cycles,"Within their native range in western North America, resident redband trout <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Oncorhynchus mykiss gairdneri</i> occupy stream habitat from high mountains to low desert. To better understand the temperature tolerance, growth, and stress physiology of native redband trout populations and compare the resilience and responses to reciprocal environments of stocks adapted to desert or montane conditions, we conducted controlled laboratory trials. We tested groups of age-0 progeny from naturally reproducing desert and montane fish stocks in temperature cycles that simulated the summer conditions typical in regional desert and montane stream habitats. The diel cycles ranged from 8������C to 16������C for montane treatments and from 18������C to 26������C for desert treatments, and our tests were repeated over 2 years. We evaluated survival, growth, feed efficiency, plasma cortisol, heat shock protein levels, and body proximate composition in samples of fish collected during and at the completion of the trials. All of the stocks tested had high survival under all conditions, regardless of their geographic origin. We found no differences consistently attributable to desert or montane origin. Growth rates and protein and lipid efficiencies varied among stocks, between temperature treatments, and between replicate years. We found that the expression of heat shock protein 70 (hsp70) was consistently higher in all stocks maintained at desert temperatures regardless of source, but the absolute quantity of proteins measured varied among populations. We conducted an additional short-term trial to evaluate the responses of different stocks to upper lethal temperature cycles that approached a daily maximum of 30������C. Although desert- and montane-adapted populations of redband trout were equally dynamic and adaptive in desert or montane diel temperature cycles, we conclude that the desert stocks will be more at risk from increasing temperatures and reduced stream flows in the summer months as climate changes."
"precipitation-snowmelt timing and snowmelt augmentation of large peak flow events, western cascades, oregon","This study tested multiple hydrologic mechanisms to explain snowpack dynamics in extreme rain-on-snow floods, which occur widely in the temperate and polar regions. We examined 26, 10 day large storm events over the period 1992-2012 in the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest in western Oregon, using statistical analyses (regression, ANOVA, and wavelet coherence) of hourly snowmelt lysimeter, air and dewpoint temperature, wind speed, precipitation, and discharge data. All events involved snowpack outflow, but only seven events had continuous net snowpack outflow, including three of the five top-ranked peak discharge events. Peak discharge was not related to precipitation rate, but it was related to the 10 day sum of precipitation and net snowpack outflow, indicating an increased flood response to continuously melting snowpacks. The two largest peak discharge events in the study had significant wavelet coherence at multiple time scales over several days; a distribution of phase differences between precipitation and net snowpack outflow at the 12-32 h time scale with a sharp peak at /2 radians; and strongly correlated snowpack outflow among lysimeters representing 42% of basin area. The recipe for an extreme rain-on-snow event includes persistent, slow melt within the snowpack, which appears to produce a near-saturated zone within the snowpack throughout the landscape, such that the snowpack may transmit pressure waves of precipitation directly to streams, and this process is synchronized across the landscape. Further work is needed to understand the internal dynamics of a melting snowpack throughout a snow-covered landscape and its contribution to extreme rain-on-snow floods."
"long-term snow, climate, and streamflow trends at the reynolds creek experimental watershed, owyhee mountains, idaho, united states","Forty-five water years (1962-2006) of carefully measured temperature, precipitation, snow, and streamflow data for valley bottom, midelevation, and high-elevation sites within the Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed, located in the state of Idaho, United States, were analyzed to evaluate the extent and magnitude of the impact of climate warming on the hydrology and related resources in the interior northwestern United States. This analysis shows significant trends of increasing temperature at all elevations, with larger increases in daily minimum than daily maximum. The proportion of snow to rain has decreased at all elevations, with the largest and most significant decreases at midelevations and low elevations. Maximum seasonal snow water equivalent has decreased at all elevations, again with the most significant decreases at lower elevations, where the length of the snow season has decreased by nearly a month. All trends show a significant elevation gradient in either timing or magnitude. Though interannual variability is large, there has been no significant change in water year total precipitation or streamflow. Streamflow shows a seasonal shift, stronger at high elevations and delayed at lower elevations, to larger winter and early spring flows and reduced late spring and summer flows."
current health issues and management strategies for white pines in the western united states and canada,"The introduced pathogen <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Cronartium ribicola</i>, cause of white pine blister rust, has spread across much of western North America and established known infestations within all but one species of white pine endemic to western Canada and the United States. Blister rust damage to severely diseased trees reduces reproduction and survival. Severe losses in white pine populations have resulted in site conversions to other species and seriously impacted resource values for timber, wildlife, watershed, recreation, aesthetic and other ecosystem services. In addition to blister rust, other major forest health threats and challenges to sustaining or restoring white pine populations are infestations of other pathogens, insects, fire, management practices that favour other tree species, and climatic change. Recent, large-scale outbreaks of mountain pine beetle have raised concerns for the viability of some white pine populations. In the 1960s, forest disease management for western white pine and sugar pine shifted from <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Ribes</i> eradication to planting seedlings selected for better survival and resistance to blister rust. Seed orchards for producing improved white pines have been established, but deployment of that improved stock is hampered by a lack of planting opportunities. The inheritance and mechanisms of resistance are best known for western white pine and sugar pine; but new work is extending an understanding of genetics to all the western species of white pine. Current management efforts are focused on locating and protecting individual trees resistant to blister rust and assessing their disease resistance and other adaptive traits. In response to the threats from blister rust, the strategic goal is to sustain or restore viable white pine populations in western forest ecosystems. The four action components of the strategy are: (1) conserve genetic resistance to <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">C. ribicola</i>; (2) reduce the risk of adverse impact in stands currently uninfested; (3) restore and maintain white pines where blister rust is causing impacts and (4) assess and monitor the health and management of white pines. Successful implementation requires long-term support for coordinated efforts of management and research agencies, forest industry and an informed public."
shifts in western north american snowmelt runoff regimes for the recent warm decades,"Climate change-driven shifts in streamflow timing have been documented for western North America and are expected to continue with increased warming. These changes will likely have the greatest implications on already short and overcommitted water supplies in the region. This study investigated changes in western North American streamflow timing over the 1948-2008 period, including the very recent warm decade not previously considered, through (i) trends in streamflow timing measures, (ii) two second-order linear models applied simultaneously over the region to test for the acceleration of these changes, and (iii) changes in runoff regimes. Basins were categorized by the percentage of snowmelt-derived runoff to enable the comparison of groups of streams with similar runoff characteristics and to quantify shifts in snowmelt-dominated regimes. Results indicate that streamflow has continued to shift to earlier in the water year, most notably for those basins with the largest snowmelt runoff component. However, an acceleration of these streamflow timing changes for the recent warm decades is not clearly indicated. Most coastal rain-dominated and some interior basins have experienced later timing. The timing changes are connected to area-wide warmer temperatures, especially in March and January, and to precipitation shifts that bear subregional signatures. Notably, a set of the most vulnerable basins has experienced runoff regime changes, such that basins that were snowmelt dominated at the beginning of the observational period shifted to mostly rain dominated in later years. These most vulnerable regions for regime shifts are in the California Sierra Nevada, eastern Washington, Idaho, and northeastern New Mexico. Snowmelt regime changes may indicate that the time available for adaptation of water supply systems to climatic changes in vulnerable regions are shorter than previously recognized."
climate influences the demography of three dominant sagebrush steppe plants,"Climate change could alter the population growth of dominant species, leading to profound effects on community structure and ecosystem dynamics. Understanding the links between historical variation in climate and population vital rates (survival, growth, recruitment) is one way to predict the impact of future climate change. Using a unique, long-term data set from eastern Idaho, USA, we parameterized integral projection models (IPMs) for <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Pseudoroegneria spicata</i>, <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Hesperostipa comata</i>, and <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Artemisia tripartita</i> to identify the demographic rates and climate variables most important for population growth. We described survival, growth, and recruitment as a function of genet size using mixed-effect regression models that incorporated climate variables. Elasticites for the survival+growth portion of the kernel were larger than the recruitment portion for all three species, with survival+growth accounting for 87-95% of the total elasticity. The genet sizes with the highest elasticity values in each species were very close to the genet size threshold where survival approached 100%. We found strong effects of climate on the population growth rate of two of our three species. In <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">H. comata</i>, a 1% decrease in previous year's precipitation would lead to a 0.6% decrease in population growth. In <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">A. tripartita</i>, a 1% increase in summer temperature would result in a 1.3% increase in population growth. In both <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">H. comata</i> and <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">A. tripartita</i>, climate influenced population growth by affecting genet growth more than survival or recruitment. Late-winter snow was the most important climate variable for <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">P. spicata</i>, but its effect on population growth was smaller than the climate effects we found in <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">H. comata</i> or <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">A. tripartita</i>. For all three species, demographic responses lagged climate by at least one year. Our analysis indicates that understanding climate effects on genet growth may be crucial for anticipating future changes in the structure and function of sagebrush steppe vegetation."
sensitivity of the north american monsoon to antecedent rocky mountain snowpack,"While the inverse relationship between antecedent snowpack in the Himalayas and Tibetan Plateau and subsequent monsoon rainfall in South and East Asia has been extensively studied and established, the potential for such a relationship between Rocky Mountain snowpack and the North American monsoon remains uncertain. The present study represents the first modeling assessment of this vital predictability issue, going beyond simple observational correlations, which fail to identify causality or a mechanism, by applying a regional climate model to demonstrate that a deep Rocky Mountain snowpack tends to hinder the poleward advance of the subtropical ridge and associated monsoon rainfall into the Southwest United States. A deep, extensive snowpack increases the surface albedo and provides an abundant surge of soil moisture, both of which reduce tropospheric temperatures in spring and early summer, weakening the land-ocean thermal gradient and related monsoon system. This snow-monsoon relationship, which may serve as a vital prediction tool of summer rainfall in the semi-arid Southwest United States, has direct implications for regional water supply, streamflow, and biodiversity."
"transition from sagebrush steppe to annual grass (<i xmlns=""http://wwww3.org/1999/xhtml"">bromus tectorum</i>): influence on belowground carbon and nitrogen.","Vegetation changes associated with climate shifts and anthropogenic disturbance have major impacts on biogeochemical cycling. Much of the interior western United States currently is dominated by sagebrush (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Artemisia tridentata</i> Nutt.) ecosystems. At low to intermediate elevations, sagebrush ecosystems increasingly are influenced by cheatgrass (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Bromus tectorum</i> L.) invasion. Little currently is known about the distribution of belowground organic carbon (OC) on these changing landscapes, how annual grass invasion affects OC pools, or the role that nitrogen (N) plays in carbon (C) retention. As part of a Joint Fire Sciences-funded project called the Sagebrush Treatment Evaluation Project (SageSTEP), we quantified the depth distribution of soil OC and N at seven sites experiencing cheatgrass invasion. We sampled plots that retained sagebrush, but represented a continuum of cheatgrass invasion into the understory. Eighty-four soil cores were taken using a mechanically driven diamond-tipped core drill to a depth of 90 cm, or until bedrock or a restrictive layer was encountered. Samples were taken in 15-cm increments, and soil, rocks, and roots were analyzed for OC and total N. We determined that cheatgrass influences the vertical distribution of OC and N within the soil profile and might result in decreased soil OC content below 60 cm. We also found that OC and total N associated with coarse fragments accounted for at least 10% of belowground pools. This emphasizes the need for researchers to quantify nutrients in deep soil horizons and coarse fragments."
modelling climate change impacts on spring runoff for the rocky mountains of montana and alberta ii: runoff change projections using future scenarios,"In Part I of this two-part study, the Simulated Grid microclimate model (SIMGRID) was modified and the new version validated on the St. Mary River watershed in northern Montana, using historical data. In Part II, future climate change scenarios are used to estimate spring streamflow (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Q<sub>S</sub></i>) for the 1961-2099 period. Relative to the base period (1961-1990), the model indicates median year <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Q<sub>S</sub></i> decline of 3-8% by the 2020s, 8-17% by the 2050s, and 15-27% by the 2080s. Mean onset of the spring pulse is projected to occur in early March or late February for the 2080s, 36 to 50 days earlier than for the 1961-1990 reference period. Model results generally indicate increased precipitation, but spring runoff volumes will decrease substantially, because the higher rain:snow ratio and shorter accumulation period will decrease snowpack volume. Overall, the results of this study indicate that the increased winter temperature resulting from anthropogenically-induced climate change, will result in shorter winters, reduced snowpack volume, and earlier spring snowmelt and runoff onset, resulting in substantial reductions in spring discharge."
"periglacial debris-flow initiation and susceptibility and glacier recession from imagery, airborne lidar, and ground-based mapping","Climate changes in the Pacific Northwest, USA, may cause both retreat of alpine glaciers and increases in the frequency and magnitude of storms delivering rainfall at high elevations absent significant snowpack, and both of these changes may affect the frequency and severity of destructive debris flows initiating on the region's composite volcanoes. A better understanding of debris-flow susceptibility on these volcanoes' slopes is therefore warranted. Field mapping and remote sensing data, including airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR), were used to locate and characterize initiation sites of six debris flows that occurred during an ""atmospheric river"" event (warm wet storm) on Mount Rainier, Washington, in November 2006, and data from prior studies identified six more debris flows that occurred in 2001-2005. These 12 debris flows had initiation sources at the heads of 17 gullies distributed over seven distinct initiation zones near the termini of glaciers, and all debris-flow initiation sites were located within areas exposed by glacier retreat in the past century. Gully locations were identified by their steep walls and heads on a 1-m digital elevation model (DEM) from LiDAR data collected in 2007-2008. Gullies in which debris flows initiated were differentiated from numerous non-initiating gullies primarily by the greater upslope contributing areas of the former. Initiation mechanisms were inferred from pre- and post-2006 gully width measurements from aerial photos and the LiDAR DEM, respectively, field observations of gully banks, and elevation changes calculated from repeated LiDAR, and these data indicate that debris flows were initiated by distributed sources, including bank mass failures, related to erosion by overland flow of water. Using gully-head initiation sites for debris flows that occurred during 2001-2006, a data model was developed to explore the viability of the method for characterization of debris-flow initiation susceptibilities on Mount Rainier. The initiation sites were found to occupy a restricted part of the four-dimensional space defined by mean and standard deviation of simulated glacial meltwater flow, slope angle, and minimum distance to an area of recent (1994-2008) glacier retreat. The model identifies the heads of most gullies, including all sites of known debris-flow initiation, as high-susceptibility areas, but does not appear to differentiate between areas of varying gully-head density or between debris-flow and no-debris-flow gullies. The model and field data, despite limitations, do provide insight into debris-flow processes, as well as feasible methods for mapping and assessment of debris-flow susceptibilities on periglacial areas of the Cascade Range."
"stream temperature regimes and the distribution of the rocky mountain tailed frog at its northern range limit, southeastern british columbia","Stream temperature is one of the most important physical parameters affecting growth and development of amphibians, especially cold-adapted stream dwelling amphibians such as tailed frogs. We characterized the annual thermal regime of streams at the northern range of the Rocky Mountain tailed frog (Ascaphus montanus) and associated it with tailed frog distribution and biomass. We monitored stream temperatures between August 2008 and August 2009 at 41 sites ranging from small headwater streams to larger valley bottom streams. At a subset of these sites (n = 27), we collected tailed frog abundance and biomass estimates. Two temperature metrics, maximum weekly average temperature (MWAT) and accumulated degree days > 5 degrees C (DD 5), a measure of physiological time, were related to tailed frog occurrence and abundance. Larval occurrence was found to be limited when DD 5 was = 160 degrees C and MWAT = 8 degrees C. No breeding streams were too warm to support tailed frogs. Frogs and tadpoles had similar realized niche centres for both MWAT (about 10.8 degrees C) and DD 5 (about 355 degrees C). However, frogs had greater realized niche widths than tadpoles. The temperature metrics were only weakly related to catchment-scale variables (area, mean elevation, ruggedness, aspect, site elevation), such that catchment scale variables cannot be used to make reliable predictions of thermal habitat suitability. This study provides a greater understanding of the thermal conditions required for tailed frog occurrence and may help managers predict potential range shifts resulting from climate change or land use and more effectively conserve tailed frogs into the future."
"assessing streamflow sensitivity to temperature increases in the salmon river basin, idaho","Increased temperatures are occurring in the Salmon River Basin (SRB) of Idaho and are anticipated to continue increasing in the future, leading to complex changes in climate and water resources. To address these concerns, the objective of this study was to evaluate streamflow changes/sensitivity when temperatures increase. A hydrological model, the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model, was applied to simulate streamflow under thirty temperature increase scenarios (i.e., rising 0.1������C per step to 3������C). It was found that the annual mean streamflow decreased whenever temperatures increased in the SRB. Streamflow increases in winter and decreases in spring and summer but is barely affected by temperature in autumn. On a monthly basis, streamflow responses varied in response to rising temperatures. When temperature increased, the streamflow increase occurred from November to February, and it decreased from May to July. The analysis also discovered linear relationships between rising temperatures and streamflow changes throughout the year, with the exception of June and July, which revealed logarithmic correlations. Results obtained by daily streamflow analysis showed that center time occurred 10-30 d earlier when temperatures increased 2������C and 15-45 d earlier when temperatures increased 3������C. Finally, the Richards-Barker Index (R-B Index), a flashiness index, also increased with rising temperatures, and a higher R-B Index causes bank erosion problems. Changes in the streamflow due to the temperature increases have a significant implication both for the water management and ecological processes."
downscaling extremes - an intercomparison of multiple statistical methods for present climate,"Five statistical downscaling methods [automated regression-based statistical downscaling (ASD), bias correction spatial disaggregation (BCSD), quantile regression neural networks (QRNN), TreeGen (TG), and expanded downscaling (XDS)] are compared with respect to representing climatic extremes. The tests are conducted at six stations from the coastal, mountainous, and taiga region of British Columbia, Canada, whose climatic extremes are measured using the 27 Climate Indices of Extremes (ClimDEX; http://www.climdex.org/climdex/index.action) indices. All methods are calibrated from data prior to 1991, and tested against the two decades from 1991 to 2010. A three-step testing procedure is used to establish a given method as reliable for any given index. The first step analyzes the sensitivity of a method to actual index anomalies by correlating observed and NCEP-downscaled annual index values; then, whether the <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">distribution</i> of an index corresponds to observations is tested. Finally, this latter test is applied to a downscaled climate simulation. This gives a total of 486 single and 162 combined tests. The temperature-related indices pass about twice as many tests as the precipitation indices, and temporally more complex indices that involve consecutive days pass none of the combined tests. With respect to regions, there is some tendency of better performance at the coastal and mountaintop stations. With respect to methods, XDS performed best, on average, with 19% (48%) of passed combined (single) tests, followed by BCSD and QRNN with 10% (45%) and 10% (31%), respectively, ASD with 6% (23%), and TG with 4% (21%) of passed tests. Limitations of the testing approach and possible consequences for the downscaling of extremes in these regions are discussed."
height-growth response to climatic changes differs among populations of douglas-fir: a novel analysis of historic data,"Projected climate change will affect existing forests, as substantial changes are predicted to occur during their life spans. Species that have ample intraspecific genetic differentiation, such as Douglas-fir (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Pseudotsuga menziesii</i> (Mirb.) Franco), are expected to display population-specific growth responses to climate change. Using a mixed-effects modeling approach, we describe three-year height (HT) growth response to changes in climate of interior Douglas-fir populations. We incorporate climate information at the population level, yielding a model that is specific to both species and population. We use data from provenance tests from previous studies that comprised 236 populations from Idaho, Montana, and eastern Washington, USA. The most sensitive indicator of climate was the mean temperature of the coldest month. Population maximum HT and HT growth response to changes in climate were dependent on seed source climate. All populations had optimum HT growth when transferred to climates with warmer winters; those originating in sites with the warmest winters were taller across sites and had highest HT growth at transfer distances closest to zero; those from colder climates were shortest and had optimum HT growth when transferred the farthest. Although this differential response damped the height growth differences among populations, cold-climate populations still achieved their maximum growth at lower temperatures than warm-climate populations. The results highlight the relevance of understanding climate change impacts at the population level, particularly in a species with ample genetic variation among populations."
"estimates of carbon stored in harvested wood products from the united states forest service northern region, 1906-2010","Background: Global forests capture and store significant amounts of CO<sub xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">2</sub> through photosynthesis. When carbon is removed from forests through harvest, a portion of the harvested carbon is stored in wood products, often for many decades. The United States Forest Service (USFS) and other agencies are interested in accurately accounting for carbon flux associated with harvested wood products (HWP) to meet greenhouse gas monitoring commitments and climate change adaptation and mitigation objectives. This paper uses the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) production accounting approach and the California Forest Project Protocol (CFPP) to estimate HWP carbon storage from 1906 to 2010 for the USFS Northern Region, which includes forests in northern Idaho, Montana, South Dakota, and eastern Washington. Results: Based on the IPCC approach, carbon stocks in the HWP pool were increasing at one million megagrams of carbon (MgC) per year in the mid 1960s, with peak cumulative storage of 28 million MgC occurring in 1995. Net positive flux into the HWP pool over this period is primarily attributable to high harvest levels in the mid twentieth century. Harvest levels declined after 1970, resulting in less carbon entering the HWP pool. Since 1995, emissions from HWP at solid waste disposal sites have exceeded additions from harvesting, resulting in a decline in the total amount of carbon stored in the HWP pool. The CFPP approach shows a similar trend, with 100-year average carbon storage for each annual Northern Region harvest peaking in 1969 at 937,900 MgC, and fluctuating between 84,000 and 150,000 MgC over the last decade. Conclusions: The Northern Region HWP pool is now in a period of negative net annual stock change because the decay of products harvested between 1906 and 2010 exceeds additions of carbon to the HWP pool through harvest. However, total forest carbon includes both HWP and ecosystem carbon, which may have increased over the study period. Though our emphasis is on the Northern Region, we provide a framework by which the IPCC and CFPP methods can be applied broadly at sub-national scales to other regions, land management units, or firms."
stream isotherm shifts from climate change and implications for distributions of ectothermic organisms,"Stream ecosystems are especially vulnerable to climate warming because most aquatic organisms are ectothermic and live in dendritic networks that are easily fragmented. Many bioclimatic models predict significant range contractions in stream biotas, but subsequent biological assessments have rarely been done to determine the accuracy of these predictions. Assessments are difficult because model predictions are either untestable or so imprecise that definitive answers may not be obtained within timespans relevant for effective conservation. Here, we develop the equations for calculating isotherm shift rates (ISRs) in streams that can be used to represent historic or future warming scenarios and be calibrated to individual streams using local measurements of stream temperature and slope. A set of reference equations and formulas are provided for application to most streams. Example calculations for streams with lapse rates of 0.8������C/100 m and long-term warming rates of 0.1-0.2������C decade<sup xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">-1</sup> indicate that isotherms shift upstream at 0.13-1.3 km decade<sup xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">-1</sup> in steep streams (2-10% slope) and 1.3-25 km decade<sup xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">-1</sup> in flat streams (0.1-1% slope). Used more generally with global scenarios, the equations predict isotherms shifted 1.5-43 km in many streams during the 20th Century as air temperatures increased by 0.6������C and would shift another 5-143 km in the first half of the 21st Century if midrange projections of a 2������C air temperature increase occur. Variability analysis suggests that short-term variation associated with interannual stream temperature changes will mask long-term isotherm shifts for several decades in most locations, so extended biological monitoring efforts are required to document anticipated distribution shifts. Resampling of historical sites could yield estimates of biological responses in the short term and should be prioritized to validate bioclimatic models and develop a better understanding about the effects of temperature increases on stream biotas."
soil respiration and bacterial structure and function after 17 years of a reciprocal soil transplant experiment,"The effects of climate change on soil organic matter-its structure, microbial community, carbon storage, and respiration response-remain uncertain and widely debated. In addition, the effects of climate changes on ecosystem structure and function are often modulated or delayed, meaning that short-term experiments are not sufficient to characterize ecosystem responses. This study capitalized on a long-term reciprocal soil transplant experiment to examine the response of dryland soils to climate change. The two transplant sites were separated by 500 m of elevation on the same mountain slope in eastern Washington state, USA, and had similar plant species and soil types. We resampled the original 1994 soil transplants and controls, measuring CO2 production, temperature response, enzyme activity, and bacterial community structure after 17 years. Over a laboratory incubation of 100 days, reciprocally transplanted soils respired roughly equal cumulative amounts of carbon as non-transplanted controls from the same site. Soils transplanted from the hot, dry, lower site to the cooler and wetter (difference of -5 degrees C monthly maximum air temperature, +50 mm yr(-1) precipitation) upper site exhibited almost no respiratory response to temperature (Q(10) of 1.1), but soils originally from the upper, cooler site had generally higher respiration rates. The bacterial community structure of transplants did not differ significantly from that of untransplanted controls, however. Slight differences in local climate between the upper and lower Rattlesnake locations, simulated with environmental control chambers during the incubation, thus prompted significant differences in microbial activity, with no observed change to bacterial structure. These results support the idea that environmental shifts can influence soil C through metabolic changes, and suggest that microbial populations responsible for soil heterotrophic respiration may be constrained in surprising ways, even as shorter-and longer-term soil microbial dynamics may be significantly different under changing climate."
using climate-fvs to project landscape-level forest carbon stores for 100 years from field and lidar measures of initial conditions,"Background: Forest resources supply a wide range of environmental services like mitigation of increasing levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO<sub xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">2</sub>). As climate is changing, forest managers have added pressure to obtain forest resources by following stand management alternatives that are biologically sustainable and economically profitable. The goal of this study is to project the effect of typical forest management actions on forest C levels, given a changing climate, in the Moscow Mountain area of north central Idaho, USA. Harvest and prescribed fire management treatments followed by plantings of one of four regionally-important commercial tree species were simulated, using the climate-sensitive version of the Forest Vegetation Simulator, to estimate the biomass of four different planted species and their C sequestration response to three climate change scenarios. Results: Results show that anticipated climate change induces a substantial decrease in C sequestration potential regardless of which of the four tree species tested are planted. It was also found that Pinus monticola has the highest capacity to sequester C by 2110, followed by <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Pinus ponderosa</i>, then <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Pseudotsuga menziesii</i>, and lastly <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Larix occidentalis</i>. Conclusions: Variability in the growth responses to climate change exhibited by the four planted species considered in this study points to the importance to forest managers of considering how well adapted seedlings may be to predicted climate change, before the seedlings are planted, and particularly if maximizing C sequestration is the management goal."
interannual variation in biomass burning and fire seasonality derived from geostationary satellite data across the contiguous united states from 1995 to 2011,"Wildfires exhibit a strong seasonality that is driven by climatic factors and human activities. Although the fire seasonality is commonly determined using burned area and fire frequency, it could also be quantified using biomass consumption estimates that directly represent biomass loss (a combination of the area burned and the fuel loading). Therefore, in this study a data set of long-term biomass consumed was derived from geostationary satellite data to explore the interannual variation in the fire seasonality and the possible impacts of climate change and land management practices across the Contiguous United States (CONUS). Specifically, daily biomass consumed data were derived using the fire radiative power retrieved from Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites series with a pixel size of 4-10 km from 1995 to 2011. Annual fire seasonality metrics including the fire season duration, the timing of the start, peak, and end of the fire season, and interannual variation and trends were derived from the 17 year biomass consumed record. These metrics were associated with climatic factors to examine drivers and mediators of fire seasonality. The results indicate that biomass consumed significantly increased at a rate of 2.87 Tg/yr; however, the derived fire season duration exhibited a shortening trend in various states over the western CONUS and no significant trend in most other regions. This suggests that the frequency of extreme fire events has increased, which is perhaps associated with an observed increase of extreme weather conditions. Further, both the start and the end of the fire season exhibited an early shift (1.5-5 d/yr) in various eastern states although a late shift occurred in Arizona and Oregon. The interannual variation and trend in the fire seasonality was more strongly related to temperature in the western CONUS and to precipitation in the southeast. The Palmer Drought Severity Index was found to effectively reflect interannual variations in total biomass consumed although it was poorly correlated to the fire seasonality metrics. The results indicate that across the CONUS, the spatial patterns of the start, peak, and end of the fire season shift regularly in various regions in response to latitudinal gradients of temperature variation."
patterns and variability of projected bioclimatic habitat for pinus albicaulis in the greater yellowstone area,"Projected climate change at a regional level is expected to shift vegetation habitat distributions over the next century. For the sub-alpine species whitebark pine (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Pinus albicaulis</i>), warming temperatures may indirectly result in loss of suitable bioclimatic habitat, reducing its distribution within its historic range. This research focuses on understanding the patterns of spatiotemporal variability for future projected <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">P. albicaulis</i> suitable habitat in the Greater Yellowstone Area (GYA) through a bioclimatic envelope approach. Since intermodel variability from General Circulation Models (GCMs) lead to differing predictions regarding the magnitude and direction of modeled suitable habitat area, nine bias-corrected statistically down-scaled GCMs were utilized to understand the uncertainty associated with modeled projections. <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">P. albicaulis</i> was modeled using a Random Forests algorithm for the 1980-2010 climate period and showed strong presence/absence separations by summer maximum temperatures and springtime snowpack. Patterns of projected habitat change by the end of the century suggested a constant decrease in suitable climate area from the 2010 baseline for both Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 8.5 and 4.5 climate forcing scenarios. Percent suitable climate area estimates ranged from 2-29% and 0.04-10% by 2099 for RCP 8.5 and 4.5 respectively. Habitat projections between GCMs displayed a decrease of variability over the 2010-2099 time period related to consistent warming above the 1910-2010 temperature normal after 2070 for all GCMs. A decreasing pattern of projected <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">P. albicaulis</i> suitable habitat area change was consistent across GCMs, despite strong differences in magnitude. Future ecological research in species distribution modeling should consider a full suite of GCM projections in the analysis to reduce extreme range contractions/expansions predictions. The results suggest that restoration strategies such as planting of seedlings and controlling competing vegetation may be necessary to maintain <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">P. albicaulis</i> in the GYA under the more extreme future climate scenarios."
amphibians in the climate vise: loss and restoration of resilience of montane wetland ecosystems in the western us,"Wetlands in the remote mountains of the western US have undergone two massive ecological ""experiments"" spanning the 20th century. Beginning in the late 1800s and expanding after World War II, fish and wildlife managers intentionally introduced millions of predatory trout (primarily <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Oncorhynchus</i> spp) into fishless mountain ponds and lakes across the western states. These new top predators, which now occupy 95% of large mountain lakes, have limited the habitat distributions of native frogs, salamanders, and wetland invertebrates to smaller, more ephemeral ponds where trout do not survive. Now a second ""experiment"" - anthropogenic climate change - threatens to eliminate many of these ephemeral habitats and shorten wetland hydroperiods. Caught between climate-induced habitat loss and predation from introduced fish, native mountain lake fauna of the western US - especially amphibians - are at risk of extirpation. Targeted fish removals, guided by models of how wetlands will change under future climate scenarios, provide innovative strategies for restoring resilience of wetland ecosystems to climate change."
"modeling ecohydrological impacts of land management and water use in the silver creek basin, idaho","A number of anthropogenic stressors, including land use change and intensive water use, have caused stream habitat deterioration in arid and semiarid climates throughout the western U.S. These often contribute to high stream temperatures, a widespread water quality problem. Stream temperature is an important indicator of stream ecosystem health and is affected by catchment-scale climate and hydrological processes, morphology, and riparian vegetation. To properly manage affected systems and achieve ecosystem sustainability, it is important to understand the relative impact of these factors. In this study, we predict relative impacts of different stressors using an integrated catchment-scale ecohydrological model that simulates hydrological processes, stream temperature, and fish growth. This type of model offers a suitable measure of ecosystem services because it provides information about the reproductive capability of fish under different conditions. We applied the model to Silver Creek, Idaho, a stream highly valued for its world-renowned trout fishery. The simulations indicated that intensive water use by agriculture and climate change are both major contributors to habitat degradation in the study area. Agricultural practices that increase water use efficiency and mitigate drainage runoff are feasible and can have positive impacts on the ecosystem. All of the mitigation strategies simulated reduced stream temperatures to varying degrees; however, not all resulted in increases in fish growth. The results indicate that temperature dynamics, rather than point statistics, determine optimal growth conditions for fish. Temperature dynamics are influenced by surface water-groundwater interactions. Combined restoration strategies that can achieve ecosystem stability under climate change should be further explored."
consequences of mountain pine beetle outbreak on forest ecosystem services in western canada,"After affecting millions of hectares of pine forests in western Canada, the mountain pine beetle (MPB; Dendroctonous ponderosae Hopkins) is spreading out of its native range and into Canada's boreal forest. Impacts of outbreaks can be environmental, economic, and social, and an ecosystem services (ES) viewpoint provides a useful perspective for an integrated approach to assessing these impacts and may help to identify how possible management strategies could minimize these impacts. In this regards, a comprehensive overview of the ecosystem functions and socioeconomic factors that have been impacted by the current outbreaks in western Canada was carried out to facilitate a more general ES assessment. In addition to timber production, current MPB outbreaks have negative effects on provisioning services (water supply and food production) and aesthetic cultural services, while effects on regulating services (carbon and forest fire) are still in debate. Among the supporting services, nutrient cycling and aquatic habitat showed short-and long-term negative effects, while terrestrial habitat showed a mostly positive response. The overall impact on ES may be more severe if salvage logging is practiced as a post-MPB forest management strategy. The outcomes of this study may help to identify areas of greatest socioecological vulnerability to MPB and identify knowledge gaps and avenues for research to advance the ES framework for MPB outbreak management."
climate trends but little net water supply shift in one of canada's most water-stressed regions over the last century,"The southern interior ecoprovince (SIE) of British Columbia, Canada represents the northernmost extent of the great western North American deserts, it is experiencing some of the nation's fastest economic and population growth making it one of Canada's most water-stressed regions, and it includes two headwater basins of the transboundary (Canada-US) Columbia River. Statistical trend analyses were performed on 90-year regional indicator time series for annual conditions in observed temperature, precipitation, and streamflow reflecting the three major SIE river basins: the Thompson, and transboundary Okanagan and Similkameen. Results suggest that regional climate has grown warmer and wetter, but with little net impact on total water supply availability. The outcome might reflect mutual cancellation of increases in precipitation inputs <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">vs.</i> evapotranspiration losses. Conclusions appeared largely insensitive to low-pass data filtering, Pacific Decadal Oscillation effects, or solar output variability. Ensemble historical global climate model runs over the same time interval support this absence of appreciable trend in regionally integrated annual runoff volume, but a possible mismatch in precipitation results suggests a direction for further study. Overall, while important changes in hydrologic timing and extremes are likely occurring here, there is limited evidence for a net change in overall water supply availability over the last century."
climate change adaptation and restoration of western trout streams: opportunities and strategies,"Climate change is contributing to the severity and rate of stream degradation by changing the timing of peak flows, altering flow regimes, creating more frequent and intense disturbances, and increasing stream temperatures. Herein we describe three case studies of trout stream adaptation that address existing and climate-driven causes of degradation through habitat restoration. The case studies vary in geography and complexity, but all include restoration efforts intended to address multiple causes of stream degradation and improve the resilience of these streams to floods, droughts, and wildfires. Four elements of successful climate adaptation projects emerge: (1) habitat assessments that help drive project location and design, (2) projects that directly address climate change impacts and increase habitat resilience, (3) projects that combine to achieve watershed-scale impacts, and (4) projects that include sufficient monitoring to determine their effectiveness. We describe solutions to common challenges in conducting climate change adaptation, including how to balance scientific assessments with opportunities when choosing projects, how smaller projects can be aggregated to achieve watershed-scale benefits, and how citizen science efforts can augment monitoring programs."
using custom scientific workflow software and gis to inform protected area climate adaptation planning in the greater yellowstone ecosystem,"Anticipating the ecological effects of climate change to inform natural resource climate adaptation planning represents one of the primary challenges of contemporary conservation science. Species distribution models have become a widely used tool to generate first-pass estimates of climate change impacts to species probabilities of occurrence. There are a number of technical challenges to constructing species distribution models that can be alleviated by the use of scientific workflow software. These challenges include data integration, visualization of modeled predictor-response relationships, and ensuring that models are reproducible and transferable in an adaptive natural resource management framework. We used freely available software called VisTrails Software for Assisted Habitat Modeling (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">VisTrails:SAHM</i>) along with a novel ecohydrological predictor dataset and the latest Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 future climate projections to construct species distribution models for eight forest and shrub species in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem in the Northern Rocky Mountains USA. The species considered included multiple species of sagebrush and juniper, <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Pinus flexilis</i>, <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Pinus contorta</i>, <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Pseudotsuga menziesii</i>, <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Populus tremuloides</i>, <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Abies lasciocarpa</i>, <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Picea engelmannii</i>, and <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Pinus albicaulis</i>. Current and future species probabilities of occurrence were mapped in a GIS by land ownership category to assess the feasibility of undertaking present and future management action. Results suggested that decreasing spring snowpack and increasing late-season soil moisture deficit will lead to deteriorating habitat area for mountain forest species and expansion of habitat area for sagebrush and juniper communities. Results were consistent across nine global climate models and two representative concentration pathway scenarios. For most forest species their projected future distributions moved up in elevation from general federal to federally restricted lands where active management is currently prohibited by agency policy. Though not yet fully mature, custom scientific workflow software shows considerable promise to ease many of the technical challenges inherent in modeling the potential ecological impacts of climate change to support climate adaptation planning."
a new framework for spatio-temporal climate change impact assessment for terrestrial wildlife,"We describe a first step framework for climate change species' impact assessments that produces spatially and temporally heterogeneous models of climate impacts. Case study results are provided for great gray owl (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Strix nebulosa</i>) in Idaho as an example of framework application. This framework applies species-specific sensitivity weights to spatial and seasonal models of climate exposure to produce spatial and seasonal models of climate impact. We also evaluated three methods of calculating sensitivity by comparing spatial models of combined exposure and sensitivity. We found the methods used to calculated sensitivity showed little difference, except where sensitivity was directional (i.e., more sensitive to an increase in temperature than a decrease). This approach may assist in the development of State Wildlife Action Plans and other wildlife management plans in the face of potential future climate change."
geologic and geomorphic controls on the occurrence of fens in the oregon cascades and implications for vulnerability and conservation,"Montane fens are biologically diverse peat-forming wetlands that develop at points of groundwater discharge. To protect these ecosystems, it is critical to understand their locations on the landscape and the hydrogeologic systems that support them. The upper Deschutes Basin has a groundwater flow system that supports baseflow in many rivers, but little is known about the wetland types and groundwater dependence of the thousands of wetlands within the watershed. In 292 randomly selected wetlands, we quantified landscape metrics thought useful for discriminating montane fens from non-peat-forming wetlands. We inspected these wetlands and classified 67 of them as fens. Of the landscape metrics, only geology reliably differentiated fens from other types of wetlands. Nearly all fens develop in low-permeability glacial till found at approximately 1400-1800 m in elevation, and are concentrated in areas mantled by pumice deposits that originated primarily from the eruption of Mt. Mazama approximately 7700 years BP. Stratigraphic and hydrologic factors indicate the fens are supplied by perched aquifers in glacial till, instead of the deeper regional aquifer system. Their hydrogeologic setting makes the fens highly vulnerable to expected changes to recharge associated with climate change, but not to groundwater pumping from the regional aquifer."
snow avalanches in western canada: investigating change in occurrence rates and implications for risk assessment and mitigation,"Snow avalanche frequency and magnitude, required for risk analysis, are best determined using historical occurrence records. In Canada, reliable records are sparse and relatively short term, extending back 30-50 years. Some Canadian avalanche forecasters suspect that climate change has increased avalanche activity in recent years. Should an increasing trend exist, analyses based on historical occurrence rates would underestimate future risk to people and infrastructure in mountain regions. We analyse 30 years of occurrence records to investigate whether a trend exists, and assess its strength. A Bayesian hierarchical model is used to estimate occurrence rate trends across six geographical zones in western Canada. The results suggest that natural avalanche occurrence rates have decreased or stayed constant; however, there is a very high level of uncertainty. This uncertainty will need to be factored into decision-making processes. To assist in this, we discuss the effect of long-term changes in avalanche occurrence rates in terms of consequences and vulnerability. We also recommend strategies for improving mitigation practices so that avalanche control operations can better adapt to changing and less predictable environments."
are high-severity fires burning at much higher rates recently than historically in dry-forest landscapes of the western usa?,"Dry forests at low elevations in temperate-zone mountains are commonly hypothesized to be at risk of exceptional rates of severe fire from climatic change and land-use effects. Their setting is fire-prone, they have been altered by land-uses, and fire severity may be increasing. However, where fires were excluded, increased fire could also be hypothesized as restorative of historical fire. These competing hypotheses are not well tested, as reference data prior to widespread land-use expansion were insufficient. Moreover, fire-climate projections were lacking for these forests. Here, I used new reference data and records of high-severity fire from 1984-2012 across all dry forests (25.5 million ha) of the western USA to test these hypotheses. I also approximated projected effects of climatic change on high-severity fire in dry forests by applying existing projections. This analysis showed the rate of recent high-severity fire in dry forests is within the range of historical rates, or is too low, overall across dry forests and individually in 42 of 43 analysis regions. Significant upward trends were lacking overall from 1984-2012 for area burned and fraction burned at high severity. Upward trends in area burned at high severity were found in only 4 of 43 analysis regions. Projections for A.D. 2046-2065 showed high-severity fire would generally be still operating at, or have been restored to historical rates, although high projections suggest high-severity fire rotations that are too short could ensue in 6 of 43 regions. Programs to generally reduce fire severity in dry forests are not supported and have significant adverse ecological impacts, including reducing habitat for native species dependent on early-successional burned patches and decreasing landscape heterogeneity that confers resilience to climatic change. Some adverse ecological effects of high-severity fires are concerns. Managers and communities can improve our ability to live with high-severity fire in dry forests."
forest managers' response to climate change science: evaluating the constructs of boundary objects and organizations,"Land managers lack locally relevant climate change science and are urgently calling for research to inform management. We conducted four climate change workshops in the U.S. northern Rocky Mountains and applied multiple methods of inquiry to understand whether the boundary organization (workshops) and objects (climate change science products) were perceived as credible and useful. Perceived credibility and usefulness increased overall, and regional-scale hydrologic information was deemed most useful. Regression models found that intention to use climate change science was predicted by usefulness, credibility, and organizational barriers. We discuss the importance of uncertainty, visualization, and best practices for effective climate change deliberation using boundary objects and organizations at the research-management interface."
regional carbon cycle responses to 25 years of variation in climate and disturbance in the us pacific northwest,"Variation in climate, disturbance regime, and forest management strongly influence terrestrial carbon sources and sinks. Spatially distributed, process-based, carbon cycle simulation models provide a means to integrate information on these various influences to estimate carbon pools and flux over large domains. Here we apply the Biome-BGC model over the four-state Northwest US region for the interval from 1986 to 2010. Landsat data were used to characterize disturbances, and forest inventory data were used to parameterize the model. The overall disturbance rate on forest land across the region was 0.8% year<sup xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">-1</sup>, with 49% as harvests, 28% as fire, and 23% as pest/pathogen. Net ecosystem production (NEP) for the 2006-2010 interval on forestland was predominantly positive (a carbon sink) throughout the region, with maximum values in the Coast Range, intermediate values in the Cascade Mountains, and relatively low values in the Inland Rocky Mountain ecoregions. Localized negative NEPs were mostly associated with recent disturbances. There was large interannual variation in regional NEP, with notably low values across the region in 2003, which was also the warmest year in the interval. The recent (2006-2010) net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) was positive for the region (14.4 TgC year<sup xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">-1</sup>). Despite a lower area-weighted mean NECB, public forestland contributed a larger proportion to the total NECB because of its larger area. Aggregated forest inventory data and inversion modeling are beginning to provide opportunities for evaluating model-simulated regional carbon stocks and fluxes."
surface water input from snowmelt and rain throughfall in western juniper: potential impacts of climate change and shifts in semi-arid vegetation,"In the western USA, shifts from snow to rain precipitation regimes and increases in western juniper cover in shrub-dominated landscapes can alter surface water input via changes in snowmelt and throughfall. To better understand how shifts in both precipitation and semi-arid vegetation cover alter above-ground hydrological processes, we assessed how rain interception differs between snow and rain surface water input; how western juniper alters snowpack dynamics; and how these above-ground processes differ across western juniper, mountain big sagebrush and low sagebrush plant communities. We collected continuous surface water input with four large lysimeters, interspace and below-canopy snow depth data and conducted periodic snow surveys for two consecutive water years (2013 and 2014). The ratio of interspace to below-canopy surface water input was greater for snow relative to rain events, averaging 79.4% and 54.8%, respectively. The greater surface water input ratio for snow is in part due to increased deposition of redistributed snow under the canopy. We simulated above-ground energy and water fluxes in western juniper, low sagebrush and mountain big sagebrush for two 8-year periods under current and projected mid-21st century warmer temperatures with the Simultaneous Heat and Water (SHAW) model. Juniper compared with low and mountain sagebrush reduced surface water input by an average of 138 mm or 24% of the total site water budget. Conversely, warming temperatures reduced surface water input by only an average of 14 mm across the three vegetation types. The future (warmer) simulations resulted in earlier snow disappearance and surface water input by 51 and 45 days, respectively, across juniper, low sagebrush and mountain sagebrush. Information from this study can help land managers in the sagebrush steppe understand how both shifts in climate and semi-arid vegetation will alter fundamental hydrological processes."
regeneration of montane forests 24 years after the 1988 yellowstone fires: a fire-catalyzed shift in lower treelines?,"Forests near the lower limit of montane tree cover are expected to be particularly vulnerable to warming climate, potentially converting to non-forest for prolonged periods if affected by canopy-removing disturbances. Such disturbance-catalyzed shifts are by nature stochastic, offering few opportunities to test these predictions. We capitalized on a landmark event exemplary of recent large disturbances - the 1988 wildfires in Yellowstone National Park (USA) - to investigate long-term (24-yr) regeneration dynamics in Douglas-fir (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Pseudotsuga menziesii</i> var. <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">glauca</i>) forests, which compose the lower treeline yet have received little study. We tested the hypothesis that, under current conditions (warmest decades in last 6000 yr), dry lower-margin stands are less apt to attain self-replacement than adjacent, but more mesic, stands farther from the ecotone. Mesic sites characterized by dense forests prefire regenerated robustly regardless of burn severity, even in large high-severity patches, whereas dry sites did so only if nearby seed sources survived (i.e., small patch size or moderate burn severity). Regeneration continued over two decades, peaking between ���������5 and 15 yr, with mesic stands continuing regenerating beyond 15 yr to a greater degree than dry stands. Self-replacement of stands by 24 yr postfire was nearly universal in mesic stands, variable but common in dry stands not adjacent to the lower ecotone, and uncommon in dry stands near the ecotone - particularly if burned at high severity. Whether the lack of regeneration in ecotonal stands is categorically directional with warming climate or part of a long-term cycle is unresolved, but we estimate that the 1988 fires converted &gt;4000 ha of lower-montane forest to grass/sage steppe for at least several decades, possibly indefinitely given current trends in climate. These data support the notion that climate-driven shifts in vegetation cover are likely to occur in punctuated fashion with disturbances, with relatively abrupt implications for montane forest cover, biogeography, and ecosystem function."
human-induced modifications to land surface fluxes and their implications on water management under past and future climate change conditions,"We used a coupled land-atmospheric simulation framework to quantify the feedback impacts of water resources in a changing climate. The simulations dynamically downscaled data from the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) data, Climate Forecast System (CFS) Version 2 and the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP), to investigate irrigation effects on temperatures and surface fluxes under current and future scenarios in Southern Idaho. This study implements irrigation schemes within the Noah Land Surface Model (LSM) coupled with the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) 3.4 at a 4-km resolution to diagnose irrigation-induced changes to surface energy fluxes and boundary layer properties. Our results suggest that induced cooling via evaporation causes a decrease of 0.8������C to the air temperature over April-October, a decrease of up to 90 m of the planetary boundary layer depth and an increase of 2.0������C in the dew point over the irrigated areas. On average, the growing season start date trends 0.46 days/year earlier and the growing season termination date trends 0.60 days/year later. A decrease in precipitation with time is also seen at all elevation ranges from the year 2040-2070, with the lowest elevation levels seeing a bigger decrease than the higher levels. Thus, irrigation-induced increases in growing degree days and modifications to surface fluxes are shown in the basin and it is critical to consider when planning both crop and water management."
"annual and decadal climate forcing of historical fire regimes in the interior pacific northwest, usa","<ca> Anticipating the consequences of climatic change for fire requires understanding of the causes of variation in historical fire regimes. We assessed the influence of annual and decadal variation in climate on fire regimes of ponderosa pine-dominated forests in eastern Oregon and Washington using existing, annually dated tree-ring reconstructions (1687-1994). In four watersheds, we compared the extent of low-severity fires (total area burned each year) to precipitation and the Southern Oscillation Index, a measure of variation in El Ni<96>o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which affects weather in this region. At the annual scale, large fires burned during dry years and El Ni<96>o years (low SOI) in all watersheds while small fires burned regardless of variation in these climate parameters. Large fires also burned during relatively wet years and La Ni<96>a years (high SOI) in one watershed, indicating that local factors can override regional climate controls in some locations. Climate from previous years did not influence current year's fire extent. The influence of ENSO on fire regimes in this region has not previously been demonstrated at these multicentury, regional scales. At the decadal scale, fire extent varied with precipitation, perhaps in response to variation in such climate features as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. Several decades of low fire extent in the watersheds during the early 1800s was synchronous with a lack of fire at other sites in North and South America, probably in response to a change in the global climate that included a lessening in the frequency and/or intensity of ENSO events."
statistical precipitation downscaling over the northwestern united states using numerically simulated precipitation as a predictor,"This study investigates whether GCM-simulated precipitation is a good predictor for regional precipitation over Washington and Oregon. In order to allow for a detailed comparison of the estimated precipitation with observations, the simulated precipitation is taken from the NCEP-NCAR reanalysis, which nearly perfectly represents the historic pressure, temperature, and humidity, but calculates precipitation according to the model physics and parameterizations. Three statistical downscaling methods are investigated: (i) local rescaling of the simulated precipitation, and two newly developed methods, namely, (ii) downscaling using singular value decomposition (SVD) with simulated precipitation as the predictor, and (iii) local rescaling with a dynamical correction. Both local scaling methods are straightforward to apply to GCMs that are used for climate change experiments and seasonal forecasts, since they only need control runs for model fitting. The SVD method requires for model fitting special reanalysis-type GCM runs nudged toward observations from a historical period (selection of analogs from the GCM chosen to optimally match the historical weather states might achieve similar results). The precipitation-based methods are compared with conventional statistical downscaling using SVD with various large-scale predictors such as geopotential height, temperature, and humidity. The skill of the different methods for reconstructing historical wintertime precipitation (1958-94) over Oregon and Washington is tested on various spatial scales as small as 50 km and on temporal scales from months to decades. All methods using precipitation as a predictor perform considerably better than the conventional downscaling. The best results using conventional methods are obtained with geopotential height at 1000 hPa or humidity at 850 hPa as predictors. In these cases correlations of monthly observed and reconstructed precipitation on the 50-km scale range from 0.43 to 0.65. The inclusion of several predictor fields does not improve the reconstructions, since they are all highly correlated. Local rescaling of simulated precipitation yields much higher correlations between 0.7 and 0.9, with the exception of the rain shadow of the Cascade Mountains in the Columbia Basin (eastern Washington). When the simulated precipitation is used as a predictor in SVD-based downscaling correlations also reach 0.7 in eastern Washington. Dynamical correction improves the local scaling considerably in the rain shadow and yields correlations almost as high as with the SVD method. Its combination of high skill and ease to use make it particularly attractive for GCM precipitation downscaling."
how does availability of meteorological forcing data impact physically based snowpack simulations?,"Physically based models facilitate understanding of seasonal snow processes but require meteorological forcing data beyond air temperature and precipitation (e.g., wind, humidity, shortwave radiation, and longwave radiation) that are typically unavailable at automatic weather stations (AWSs) and instead are often represented with empirical estimates. Research is needed to understand which forcings (after temperature and precipitation) would most benefit snow modeling through expanded observation or improved estimation techniques. Here, the impact of forcing data availability on snow model output is assessed with data-withholding experiments using 3-yr datasets at well-instrumented sites in four climates. The interplay between forcing availability and model complexity is examined among the Utah Energy Balance (UEB), the Distributed Hydrology Soil Vegetation Model (DHSVM) snow submodel, and the snow thermal model (SNTHERM). Sixty-four unique forcing scenarios were evaluated, with different assumptions regarding availability of hourly meteorological observations at each site. Modeled snow water equivalent (SWE) and snow surface temperature T-surf diverged most often because of availability of longwave radiation, which is the least frequently measured forcing in cold regions in the western United States. Availability of longwave radiation (i.e., observed vs empirically estimated) caused maximum SWE differences up to 234 mm (57% of peak SWE), mean differences up to 6.2 degrees C in T-surf, and up to 32 days difference in snow disappearance timing. From a model data perspective, more common observations of longwave radiation at AWSs could benefit snow model development and applications, but other aspects (e.g., costs, site access, and maintenance) need consideration."
transient future climate over the western united states using a regional climate model,"<ca> Regional climate models (RCMs) have improved our understanding of the effects of global climate change on specific regions. The need for realistic forcing has led to the use of fully coupled global climate models (GCMs) to produce boundary conditions for RCMs. The advantages of using fully coupled GCM output is that the global-scale interactions of all components of the climate system (ocean, sea ice, land surface, and atmosphere) are considered. This study uses an RCM, driven by a fully coupled GCM, to examine the climate of a region centered over California for the time periods 1980-99 and 2080-99. Statistically significant increases in mean monthly temperatures by up to 7<a1>C are found for the entire state. Large changes in precipitation occur in northern California in February (increase of up to 4 mm day-1 or 30%) and March (decrease of up to 3 mm day-1 or 25%). However, in most months, precipitation changes between the cases were not statistically significant. Statistically significant decreases in snow accumulation of over 100 mm (50%) occur in some months. Temperature increases lead to decreases in snow accumulation that impact the hydrologic budget by shifting spring and summer runoff into the winter months, reinforcing results of other studies that used different models and driving conditions.

"the effect of observation time and sampling frequency on mean daily maximum, minimum and average temperature","The use of long-term temperature data for climatic, ecohydrological and other studies must be scrutinized carefully because of the average daily differences due to time of observation (TOB). In this study, data from three climatic stations in Idaho were used to determine if TOB had the same effect on average daily temperature at each location and if average temperature computed from 144 observations per day was the same as average temperature computed using the traditional method. No consistent differences between sites were found; however, in the spring and autumn, average daily temperatures differed by as much as 1������C between 0600 and 1600 TOB. Average temperatures from 0700 and 0800 TOB were closest to midnight observations. Average temperatures from afternoon TOB were all higher than from midnight observations. Average daily temperatures computed from 10 min interval data, ending at TOB, were as much as 0.8������C less than the average computed from daily maximum and minimum values for 0800 through 1900 TOB. For 0600 and 0700 TOB, average temperatures computed from 10 min interval data were both less than and greater than averages computed by the usual method depending on time of year. Studies which require historical temperature records and where only small changes in temperature are expected, such as climate change modelling, will thus be difficult to verify. Also, mean daily temperature will change at locations when several readings are used to compute mean daily temperature rather than computing mean daily temperature from the daily maximum and minimum temperatures."
areal extent of seasonal snow cover in a changed climate,"In mountain snow basins, a change in climate will likely cause a change in the basin snow cover extent. A procedure for evaluating whether a given climate change scenario will speed up or slow down the seasonal decrease of snow covered area is outlined with hypothetical examples for a simple basin. This procedure has two main purposes. First, it can be used to generate snow covered area data in a new climate for input to runoff models such as the Snowmelt-Runoff Model (SRM). Second, it could potentially be used to provide input to climate models that require knowledge of the land area covered by snow at a given time. A computer program is now operational for use on real basins and is demonstrated on the Rio Grande basin in Colorado and the Illecillewaet River basin in British Columbia."
potential climate change impacts on mountain watersheds in the pacific northwest,"Global climate change due to the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has serious potential impacts on water resources in the Pacific Northwest of the USA. Climate scenarios produced by general circulation models (GCMs) do not provide enough spatial specificity for studying water resources in mountain watersheds. This study uses dynamical downscaling with a regional climate model (RCM) driven by a GCM to simulate climate change scenarios. The RCM uses a subgrid parameterization of orographic precipitation and land surface cover to simulate surface climate at the spatial scale suitable for the representation of topographic effects over mountainous regions. Numerical experiments were performed to simulate the present-day climatology and the climate conditions corresponding to a doubling of atmospheric CO<sub xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">2</sub> concentration. The RCM results show an average warming of ��������� 2.5������C, and precipitation generally increases over the Pacific Northwest and decreases over California. These simulations were used to drive a distributed hydrology model of two snow dominated watersheds, the American River and Middle Fork Flathead, in the Pacific Northwest to obtain more detailed estimates of the sensitivity of water resources to climate change. Results show that as more precipitation falls as rain rather than snow in the warmer climate, there is a 60% reduction in snowpack and a significant shift in the seasonal pattern of streamflow in the American River. Much less drastic changes are found in the Middle Fork Flathead where snowpack is only reduced by 18% and the seasonal pattern of streamflow remains intact. This study shows that the impacts of climate change on water resources are highly region specific. Furthermore, under the specific climate change scenario, the impacts are driven by the warming trend rather than the precipitation trend, which is small."
the effect of climate change on floods in british columbia,"A hydrological modelling of the flood response of two watersheds to climate change are presented. The two study watersheds are the Upper Campbell and the Illecillewaet watersheds located in British Columbia. The first watershed is a maritime watershed located on the east slopes of the Vancouver Island mountains whereas the second watershed is located in the Selkirk Mountains in Eastern British Columbia. The Canadian Climate Centre General Circulation Model (CCC GCM) has been used for the estimation of the effect of the climate change on meteorological parameters. The CCC GCM is a steady state model and the output of the 1991 run has been used. In addition to the changes in the amounts of precipitation and temperature usually assumed in hydrological climate change studies, other meteorological and climatic parameters are also considered; specifically, the effect of climate on the spatial distribution of precipitation with elevation, and also on cloud cover, glaciers, vegetation distribution, vegetation biomass production, and plant physiology. The results showed that the mean annual temperature in the two watersheds could increase by more than 3 degrees C and the annual basin-wide precipitation could increase by 7.5% in Upper Campbell watershed and by about 17% in the Illecillewaet watershed. As a result, the mean annual runoff will increase by 7.5% in the Upper Campbell watershed and 21% in the Illecillewaet basin. For the study of floods, nine flood parameters have been investigated, the total number of flood episodes, the flood days per year, the duration of flood events, the annual flood volume, the mean flood flow, the mean flood peak, the annual maximum flood peak, the day of occurrence of the centroid of flood volume, and the day of occurrence of annual maximum flood peak. These nine parameters were extracted from the hydro-graphs of the two study watersheds using the double long-term mean daily flow. The study showed that, under the climate change scenario, the floods in the maritime Upper Campbell watershed would increase, on average, in magnitude by 14%, in volume by 94%, in frequency by 11%, and duration by 44%. The timing of the floods would remain almost unchanged, and the centroid of flood volume would shift earlier by only 2 days. In contrast, in the interior mountain Illecillewaet watershed, the floods would decrease, on average, in magnitude by 7%, in volume by 38%, and frequency by 23%. The duration of flood events, under the altered climate scenario, would remain, essentially, unchanged increasing by only 2.6%. Also, the study showed that in the Illecillewaet: watershed the largest change between the altered climate and the present climate scenarios would be the timing of floods since the centroid of flood volume would occur 20 days earlier. The above changes in the flood response of the two study watersheds can be explained by the changes in the distribution and form of annual precipitation. These results indicate that different management procedures will be needed to minimize the effects of climate change on the flooding of the two climatically different watersheds and the regions that they represent."
pacific northwest regional assessment: the impacts of climate variability and climate change on the water resources of the columbia river basin,"The Pacific Northwest (PNW) of the USA, regional assessment is an integrated examination of the consequences of natural climate variability and projected future climate change for the natural and human systems of the region. The sensitivity, adaptability and vulnerability of hydrology and water resources to climate variability and change were examined in the Columbia River Basin, which covers ���������75% of the PNW and is the basis for the dominant water resources system of the PNW. The water resources system of the Columbia River is sensitive to climate variability, especially with respect to drought. Management inertia and the lack of a centralized authority coordinating all uses of the resource impede adaptability to drought and optimization of water distribution. Climate change projections suggest exacerbated conditions of conflict between users as a result of low summertime stream flow conditions. An understanding of the patterns and consequences of regional climate variability is crucial to developing an adequate response to future changes in climate."
historical spatial patterns and contemporary tree mortality in dry mixed-conifer forests,"Management and restoration of the dry, frequent-fire forests of the North American west depend on sound information about both historical and contemporary conditions to adequately address repercussions of fire suppression and changing climate. The purpose of this study is to quantify historical tree spatial patterns and assess recent mortality trends for old and large tree populations in dry mixed-conifer forests of the Northern Rocky Mountains. We analyzed historical reconstructions of forest spatial structure across six 1.0 ha plots located in mixed ponderosa pine/Douglas-fir stands in western Montana, USA. Across plots, 10-23% of trees occurred as widely spaced individuals (no neighbors within 6 m), with the remaining 77-90% of trees occurring in clumps (groups of two or more trees spaced less than 6 m apart). Mean clump size was 2.2-4.2 trees per clump, although large clumps (>10 trees) were common. Global spatial analysis with the pair correlation function indicated that ponderosa pine patterns were spatially random at all scales, while Douglas-fir trees were spatially aggregated at scales less than 6 m. The proportion of plot area farther than 9 m from the nearest tree ranged from 1% to 20% across the six study plots. Mortality rates between 1991 and 2012 averaged 0.8% yr(-1) for old ponderosa pine and 2.1% yr(-1) for old Douglas-fir. We found limited evidence of density-dependent mortality for both species pooled and for ponderosa pine individually. Douglas-fir that died between 1991 and 2012 had higher local Stand Density Index (SDI) of Douglas-fir neighbors than did Douglas-fir that survived (P = 0.003), indicating conspecific density-dependent mortality. When compared to ponderosa pine and dry mixed-conifer forests in other regions, trees were distributed much more evenly across clump sizes in our Montana study sites. Our analysis provides an estimate of the historical range of variability for spatial aspects of forest structure in dry mixed-conifer forests of the northern US Rockies and is relevant to the design of restoration and climate change adaptation treatments in such forests.

"are climate-tree growth relationships changing in north-central idaho, us.a.?","An 861-yr Douglas-fir (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Pseudotsuga menziesii</i> [Mirb.] Franco) tree-ring chronology has been recently developed for the Salmon River Valley, Challis National Forest, Idaho. Its potential for climatic reconstruction is investigated using monthly instrumental records of precipitation, temperature, and Palmer Drought Severity Index from 1895 to 1995. The temporal stability of climate-tree growth relationships is analyzed by means of evolutionary (backward and forward) and moving response functions. When precipitation and temperature are used as predictors, the strongest (and temporally stable) signal is a negative response to July temperature. Another relevant signal, albeit less temporally consistent, is a positive response to May precipitation. When the Palmer Drought Severity Index is used as an integrated predictor to highlight response to summer moisture stress, the strength of the association with tree growth increases in recent decades. This information can be used to maximize the reliability of dendroclimatic reconstructions, and has important implications for expanding the range of recent studies on altered climate-tree growth relationships during the 20th century."
"modelling conifer species distributions in mountain forests of washington state, usa","Understanding the effects of climatic change on mountain forests, where snowpacks and short growing seasons limit tree establishment and growth, is a key concern for both ecologists and foresters. We quantified associations between climatic and biophysical variables and individual conifer species distributions in mountain forests with generalized linear models. For the majority of species, a unimodal response to moisture and temperature gradients was evident, suggesting that an environmental niche can be identified. Species known to respond to limiting factors in the abiotic environment showed the strongest associations with predictor variables. The models can improve forecasts of the potential redistribution of species on the landscape in response to climatic change, but disturbance, migration rates, and limits on regeneration are important sources of uncertainty. Nevertheless, by identifying climate-based niches of different species, we can identify effective strategies for reforestation and alert managers to particularly sensitive or vulnerable ecosystems and landscapes."
"carbon storage in subalpine tree island, north cascade range, washington","Quantifying carbon (C) pools in subalpine systems is an important first step to understanding the effects of climatic variability on terrestrial C dynamics in temperate mountainous regions. We quantified C and other soil characteristics for tree islands and the vegetatively distinct meadows surrounding the tree islands at three subalpine sites (Thornton Lakes, Heather Pass, and Harts Pass) in the North Cascade Range, Washington, USA. O-horizon C storage ranged from 0.6 to 2.6 kg m<sup xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">-2</sup> in meadows and from 3.1 to 5.8 kg m<sup xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">-2</sup> in tree islands. Gradual vegetative transitions and similar soil depths result in similar quantities of mineral soil C in meadows and tree islands at Thornton Lakes (8.1 vs. 8.3 kg m<sup xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">-2</sup>) and Heather Pass (7.9 vs. 10.3 kg m<sup xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">-2</sup>). Abrupt vegetative transitions and deeper soils may allow more mineral-soil C to be stored in meadows than tree islands at Harts Pass (14.1 vs. 7.2 kg m<sup xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">-2</sup>), although these mean values are not significantly different due to high variability in soil profile properties. Mean C concentrations in mineral soil horizons have no consistent relationship with vegetation type (tree island vs. meadow). Total ecosystem C storage is higher in tree islands (range, 35.1 to 98.5 kg m<sup xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">-2</sup>) than meadows (range, 7.4 to 18.0 kg m<sup xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">-2</sup>), primarily due to large amounts of C in the aboveground biomass of trees. Consequently, the effects of future climatic variability on C storage in subalpine ecosystems will largely depend on the degree to which conditions that limit tree island expansion (winter snowpack, summer drought) are affected."
"rocky mountain ecosystems: diversity, complexity and interactions","The interior west of North America provides many opportunities to study ecosystem responses to climate change, biological diversity and management of disturbance regimes. These ecosystem responses are not unique to the Rocky Mountains, but they epitomize similar scientific problems throughout North America. Better management of these ecosystems depends on a thorough understanding of the underlying biology and ecological interactions of the species that occupy the diverse habitats of this region. This review highlights progress in research to understand aspects of this complex ecosystem."
using spatiotemporal correlative niche models for evaluating the effects of climate change on mountain pine beetle,"Over the last decade, western North America has experienced the largest mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosas Hopkins) outbreak in recorded history, and Rocky Mountain forests have been severely impacted. Although bark beetles are indigenous to North American forests, climate change has facilitated the beetle's expansion into previously unsuitable habitats. We used three correlative niche models (maximum entropy [MaxEnt], boosted regression trees, and generalized linear models) to estimate (1) the current potential distribution of the beetle in the U.S. Rocky Mountain region, (2) how this distribution has changed since historical outbreaks in the 1960s and 1970s, and (3) how the distribution may be expected to change under future climate scenarios. Additionally, we evaluated the temporal transferability of the niche models by forecasting historical models and testing the model predictions using temporally independent outbreak data from the current outbreak. Our results indicated that there has been a significant expansion of climatically suitable habitat over the past 50 yr and that much of this expansion corresponds with an upward shift in elevation across the study area. Furthermore, our models indicated that drought was a more prominent driver of current outbreak than temperature, which suggests a change in the climatic signature between historical and current outbreaks. Projections under future conditions suggest that there will be a large reduction in climatically suitable habitat for the beetle and that high-elevation forests will continue to become more susceptible to outbreak. While all three models generated reasonable predictions, the generalized linear model correctly predicted a higher percentage of current outbreak localities when trained on historical data. Our findings suggest that researchers aiming to reduce omission error in estimates of future species responses may have greater predictive success with simpler, generalized models."
a bird's eye view of small tenure holdings in british columbia,"This extension note provides a spatial description of the distribution of small, area based forest tenures in the province of British Columbia. It summarizes important socio-economic and biophysical data, including the locations of small tenures. The unique management implications associated with such distribution are highlighted, such as multiple and often overlapping values, implications of mountain pine beetle infestations, climate change, forest restoration, and socio-economic constraints and opportunities."
the metagovernance of climate change: institutional adaptation to the mountain pine beetle epidemic in british columbia,"The interior region of British Columbia is experiencing the most extensive mountain pine beetle outbreak ever recorded in North America, with 9.2 million hectares of red-attach pine forest identified in 2006. The epidemic is attributed to changing climate conditions and forest management policies that have resulted in a large number of mature, even-aged pine trees. Owing to the dominance of the forest industry in this region, there is widespread recognition that the mountain pine beetle outbreak will have significant socioeconomic impacts on forest-based communities in British Columbia. This paper examines the adaptation strategies of several communities that are affected by the mountain pine beetle epidemic. First, drawing from household survey research, latent levels of institutional capacity are discussed. Second, recent institutional adaptations are examined through the emergence of regional-scale beetle action coalitions. These institutional innovations can be characterized as a form of metagovernance, whereby collaboration and negotiated decision making are realized in the context of bureaucratic hierarchy and the extension of state power. The paper concludes with a call for stronger linkages between public and private sectors, as well as more robust forms of civic engagement as the basis for collective response to the mountain pine beetle outbreak."
has spring snowpack declined in the washington cascades?,"Our best estimates of 1 April snow water equivalent (SWE) in the Cascade Mountains of Washington State indicate a substantial (roughly 15-35%) decline from mid-century to 2006, with larger declines at low elevations and smaller declines or increases at high elevations. This range of values includes estimates from observations and hydrologic modeling, reflects a range of starting points between about 1930 and 1970 and also reflects uncertainties about sampling. The most important sampling issue springs from the fact that half the 1 April SWE in the Cascades is found below about 1240 m, altitudes at which sampling was poor before 1945. Separating the influences of temperature and precipitation on 1 April SWE in several ways, it is clear that long-term trends are dominated by trends in temperature, whereas variability in precipitation adds ""noise"" to the time series. Consideration of spatial and temporal patterns of change rules out natural variations like the Pacific Decadal Oscillation as the sole cause of the decline. Regional warming has clearly played a role, but it is not yet possible to quantify how much of that regional warming is related to greenhouse gas emissions."
riparian vegetation communities of the american pacific northwest are tied to multi-scale environmental filters,"Riparia surrounding low-order streams are dynamic environments that often support distinct biodiversity. Because of their connection to nearby uplands, riparian vegetation communities at these streams respond to many environmental filtersclimatic, physical, chemical or biotic factorsthat restrict what species can occur at a given location from within larger regional species pools. In this study, we examined how environmental filters originating at the landscape, watershed and reach scales correspond to riparian plant community composition across the interior Columbia and upper Missouri River basins, USA. We correlated riparian vegetation to environmental filters, identified unique communities and partitioned the variance within riparian vegetation data among filters originating at different scales. Riparian vegetation composition was strongly correlated to landscape-scale filters including elevation, precipitation and temperature. Watershed-scale filters such as grazing and reach filters indicative of fluvial setting were also correlated to vegetation composition, often differentiating communities with similar landscape settings. We identified 10 distinct vegetation communities. Forested communities occurred at higher elevation, moderate gradient reaches with high mean annual precipitation. Shrub-forb systems corresponded to fluvial and watershed disturbances and occurred within climates that could preclude forest establishment. Meadows corresponded to high water tables and/or high grazing activity. Variance partitioning showed that landscape-scale filters explained the most variance within vegetation communities. Global change will alter many of the environmental filters that drive vegetation. Vegetation change may occur rapidly if local filters (e.g. fluvial process) change rapidly or may occur more slowly if larger-order filters (e.g. climate) change slowly and without influencing local hydrogeomorphic filters. By identifying filter-vegetation relationships at large spatial scales, hypotheses can be constructed on how riparian vegetation communities may change under future environmental conditions.

learning to deal with climate change and catastrophic forest disturbances,"A 13-million hectare outbreak of mountain pine beetle (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Dendroctonus ponderosae</i>) in the province of British Columbia, Canada exemplifies the devastating effects that a warming climate can have for the landscape. This paper summarizes the challenges faced and lessons learned. The epidemic has increased recognition of the need to develop resilience in ecosystems, people and communities, and has forcibly broadened the thinking and approach of British Columbia's forest managers. In addition to investment in reforestation of affected areas, the government's responses emphasize recovering the economic value of killed tree through rapid harvest for timber, promoting the use of wood in construction, and economic diversification in forest-dependent communities."
controls on the temporal and spatial variability of soil moisture in a mountainous landscape: the signature of snow and complex terrain,"The controls on the spatial distribution of soil moisture include static and dynamic variables. The superposition of static and dynamic controls can lead to different soil moisture patterns for a given catchment during wetting, draining, and drying periods. These relationships can be further complicated in snow-dominated mountain regions where soil water input by precipitation is largely dictated by the spatial variability of snow accumulation and melt. In this study, we assess controls on spatial and temporal soil moisture variability in a small (0.02 km<sup xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">2</sup>), snow-dominated, semi-arid catchment by evaluating spatial correlations between soil moisture and site characteristics through different hydrologic seasons. We assess the relative importance of snow with respect to other catchment properties on the spatial variability of soil moisture and track the temporal persistence of those controls. Spatial distribution of snow, distance from divide, soil texture, and soil depth exerted significant control on the spatial variability of moisture content throughout most of the hydrologic year. These relationships were strongest during the wettest period and degraded during the dry period. As the catchment cycled through wet and dry periods, the relative spatial variability of soil moisture tended to remain unchanged. We suggest that the static properties in complex terrain (slope, aspect, soils) impose first order controls on the spatial variability of snow and resulting soil moisture patterns, and that the interaction of dynamic (timing of water input) and static influences propagate that relative constant spatial variability through most of the hydrologic year. The results demonstrate that snow exerts significant influence on how water is retained within mid-elevation semi-arid catchments and suggest that reductions in annual snowpacks associated with changing climate regimes may strongly influence spatial and temporal soil moisture patterns and catchment physical and biological processes."
"changes in patterns of streamflow from unregulated watersheds in idaho, western wyoming, and northern nevada","Recent studies have identified a pattern of earlier spring runoff across much of North America. Earlier spring runoff potentially poses numerous problems, including increased risk of flooding and reduced summer water supply for irrigation, power generation, and migratory fish passage. To identify changing runoff patterns in Idaho streams, streamflow records were analyzed for 26 U.S. Geological Survey gaging stations in Idaho, western Wyoming, and northern Nevada, each with a minimum of 41 years of record. The 26 stations are located on 23 unregulated and relatively pristine streams that drain areas ranging from 28 to &gt;35,000 km<sup xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">2</sup>. Four runoff parameters were trend tested at each station for both the period of historical record and from 1967 through 2007. Parameters tested were annual mean streamflow, annual minimum daily streamflow, and the dates of the 25th and 50th percentiles of the annual total streamflow. Results of a nonparametric Mann-Kendall trend test revealed a trend toward lower annual mean and annual minimum streamflows at a majority of the stations, as well as a trend toward earlier snowmelt runoff. Significant downward trends over the period of historical record were most prevalent for the annual minimum streamflow (12 stations) and the 50th percentile of streamflow (11 stations). At most stations, trends were more pronounced during the period from 1967 through 2007. A regional Kendall test for water years 1967 through 2007 revealed significant regional trends in the percent change in the annual mean and annual minimum streamflows (0.67% less per year and 0.62% less per year, respectively), the 25th percentile of streamflow (12.3 days earlier), and the 50th percentile of streamflow (11.5 days earlier)."
forest health and climate change: a british columbia perspective,"BC's forests have already faced two simultaneous, globally significant, epidemics linked to climate change; the Dothistroma needle blight epidemic in NW BC and the massive mountain pine beetle epidemic throughout the BC Interior. Building on these experiences, we have compiled our best estimates of how we believe other forest health agents may behave as climate change continues to influence our forests. We have drawn on literature from around the world but have focused on the situation in BC. We have made management recommendations based on what we have seen so far and what we expect to come."
decline of planted lodgepole pine in the southern interior of british columbia,"Lodgepole pine is extensively planted across western Canada but little is known about development of these stands beyond the juvenile stage. We quantified stocking status and damage incidence in sixty-six 15- to 30-year-old lodgepole pine plantations that had previously been declared free-growing in the southern interior of British Columbia. The stands were located in six biogeoclimatic zones: Engelmann Spruce-Subalpine Fir (ESSF), Montane Spruce (MS), Interior Cedar-Hemlock (ICH), Interior Douglas-fir (IDF), Sub-Boreal Spruce (SBS), and Sub-Boreal Pine-Spruce (SBPS). Free-growing standards were no longer met on 27% of plantations, with the worst performance (70% no longer free-growing) in the Interior Cedar-Hemlock forests. Natural regeneration was common but it was half the size of lodgepole pine. Biotic damage, especially hard pine stem rusts, was the dominant factor reducing free-growing densities. Stands were at greater risk of reduced stocking where summer precipitation was higher or soil moisture regimes were wetter and where stands had been broadcast-burned prior to planting or received secondary treatments of brushing or pruning. Reforestation policies that encourage widespread planting of lodgepole pine, particularly in areas where lodgepole pine has limited natural occurrence such as in the ICH zone, should be reconsidered given that health problems are extensive and are expected to increase with climate change."
striving for sustainability and resilience in the face of unprecedented change: the case of the mountain pine beetle outbreak in british columbia,"A massive insect outbreak in the public forests of central British Columbia (Canada) poses a serious challenge for sustainable forest management planning. Tree mortality caused by natural disturbances has always been a part of wild and managed forests, but climate change is accentuating the uncertainty around such losses. Policy responses to accelerate overall timber harvesting levels to prevent further tree mortality and to aggressively salvage value from dead wood before it deteriorates can be disruptive and even counter-productive in the long run. Current alternatives are to strategically redirect existing timber harvesting quotas to the most vulnerable areas, minimize overall uplifts in cutting activity, prolong the period over which harvested timber can be processed, avoid the harvesting of mixed species stands or those with good advance regeneration, employ more partial cutting or ""selective logging"" techniques, and relax standards for acceptable species and inter-tree spacing during post-disturbance stand recovery. At the same time, careful attention to species composition and evolving landscape risk profiles may facilitate adaptation to anticipated climate change and reduce vulnerability to future disturbances. Harvest levels must be set conservatively over the full planning horizon if it is important to assure continuity of the timber supply with few disruptions to regional socio-economics and less stress to ecosystems. Broader lessons in sustainability include the option to emphasize persistence, continuity and flexibility over the long term, though at the expense of maximized production and full resource utilization in the short term."
climatic variability regulates the occurrence and extent of large fires in the subalpine forests of the canadian rockies,"Drought occurrence and wildfire activity in subalpine forests in Kootenay National Park (KNP) of the Canadian Rockies are studied by focusing on the interannual and multi-decadal variations in climate patterns of the Pacific Ocean. The question addressed is whether broad-scale climate patterns can regulate both large fire occurrence and fire-free periods causing fuel buildups. This study compared years of large wildfire outbreaks for the subalpine forests of KNP during the last three centuries using indices of climate patterns of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and El Ni������o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). PDO and ENSO were correlated with drought and fire occurrence in KNP. A positive PDO-positive ENSO combination created extreme drought conducive to crown fires, indicating that the occurrence of high-severity wildfires in these generally moist/cool forests is strongly determined by climatic anomalies. Large fire activity is chiefly modulated by PDO compared to ENSO, because a negative PDO phase greatly decreased fire activity in the mid-twentieth century. Although this fire-free period is seemingly matched with a fire-suppression period, it may be attributable to a negative PDO, which increased precipitation in the region. This mid-century fire gap contributed to the accumulation of old forests serving as loaded fuels within the landscape and ultimately led to occurrences of crown fires as the PDO shifted to the positive phase. Thus, in addition to the fundamental importance of interannual variations in the Pacific that initiates a current-year severe drought, multi-decadal scale climate variability also influences the extent and severity of subsequent fires by modulating pre-fire landscape conditions. For fire management in subalpine areas of the Rockies, although drought occurrence is a primary concern and there are still uncertainties in the detailed changes in fire risk through the successional process, it is worth paying attention to fuel-loads of older forests in the landscape, which may lead to extensive large fires. Because the climatic teleconnection pattern is one of the main drivers of crown fire occurrence in the region in terms of creating current summer drought, and also for constructing a landscape structure prone to larger fires, more of a focus on short to long-term variations in the climate for wildfire management is needed in high-elevation forested landscapes."
global weirding in british columbia: climate change and the habitat of terrestrial vertebrates,"The authors summarize the distribution of terrestrial vertebrates of British Columbia across major habitat types and present empirical and projected effects of global weirding within two particularly vulnerable habitats - alpine and wetland. Global weirding embraces all phenomena associated with climate change: increases in average temperatures, heat waves, cold spells, floods, droughts, hurricanes, blizzards, plant and animal die-offs, population explosions, new animal migration patterns, plus dramatic regional differences. Current data suggest that many alpine species will be lost to changes in habitat wrought by climate, particularly increases in average temperatures. For many wetlands, particularly in the central and southern interior of the province, the basic issue is simple - the incoming water is decreasing and the outgoing water (evaporation) is increasing. The authors illustrate three approaches to projecting trends in wetland habitat, elaborating on the ""drying index"" approach, in which they have most confidence. For wetland species, they say management will struggle with the concept of a real-world triage-allocating conservation efforts where they are most likely to succeed and have the most benefit. They conclude that several conservation approaches for wetland species will face the difficulty of allocating water between needs of these species and of humans."
groundwater dynamics mediate low-flow response to global warming in snow-dominated alpine regions,"In mountain environments, spatial and temporal patterns of snow accumulation and melt are dominant controls on hydrologic responses to climate change. In this paper, we develop a simple conceptual model that links the timing of peak snowmelt with geologically mediated differences in rate of streamflow recession. This model demonstrates that within the western United States, spatial differences in subsurface drainage rates can exacerbate summer streamflow losses associated with diminishing snowpacks. Application of a process-based hydrologic model to four watersheds in the Western Cordillera further reveals that contingent on timing of snowmelt, slower draining watersheds are likely to have more water in summer but paradoxically are subject to the greatest summer water losses under a 1.5 degrees C warming scenario. A slow draining watershed located in the young volcanic arc of the High Cascades in Oregon shows 4 times the summer streamflow reduction when compared with faster draining watersheds with similar timing of peak snowmelt. On the other hand, watersheds where snowmelt occurs late in the season but have little groundwater influence show high relative sensitivities to snowpack changes due to warming, as shown by a high-elevation granitic Sierran watershed. Our results highlight the importance of geological factors in interpreting hydrologic response to climate change and argue for a geoclimatic framework to guide the design of monitoring networks that will become the basis for assessing climate change impacts in mountain regions throughout the globe."
elevational shifts in thermal suitability for mountain pine beetle population growth in a changing climate,"Future forests are being shaped by changing climate and disturbances. Climate change is causing Large-scale forest declines globally, in addition to distributional shifts of many tree species. Because environmental cues dictate insect seasonality and population success, climate change is also influencing tree-killing bark beetles. The mountain pine beetle, Dendroctonus ponderosae, is a major disturbance in Pinus forests of the western US. Using a mechanistic, phenology-based demographic model driven by downscaled daily temperature data, we describe recent and future spatial and temporal thermal suitability for mountain pine beetle population growth in a topographically complex region. Trends in model-predicted growth rates among Global Climate Models were similar and suggest that, relative to future trends, mountain pine beetle population growth within the past 60 years was most optimal at middle elevations and Least optimal at the Lowest and highest elevations. This trend aligns with observed mountain pine beetle-caused tree mortality that was greatest at middle elevations between 1997 and 2013, as estimated from Aerial Detection Surveys. However, thermal suitability for optimal phenological synchrony was predicted to shift in recent years, and by the end of the century, the best thermal habitats for mountain pine beetle will be at the Lowest and highest elevations. Mechanistic demographic models are valuable tools for modelling future thermal regimes that may be both beneficial and maladaptive for mountain pine beetle population growth and subsequent tree mortality."
standardized occupancy maps for selected wildlife in central british columbia,"Habitat occupancy models were developed for 10 vertebrate species that we expected would demonstrate a gradient of response to extensive losses of lodgepole pine (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Pinus contorta</i>) and other linked habitat alterations resulting from the mountain pine beetle (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Dendroctonus ponderosae</i>) infestation and gradual changes in regional climate. A process-based Bayesian Belief Network approach was used to develop interlinked species models focussed at two levels of land management: (1) the forest stand level including changes in forest overstorey and understorey species composition, within-stand structures, canopy closure, and amounts of standing and fallen deadwood; and (2) the landscape level including changes in size of habitat patches, seral stage composition, and proximity to roads. We also considered indirect influences of broad ecological changes including alteration of some key species interactions (e.g., displacement from preferred habitat and [or] increased risk of mortality). We used results of this modelling to provide preliminary predictions of species occupancy in a large area of British Columbia designated by the Nature Conservancy of Canada as their Central Interior ecoregion. This work demonstrates an approach to building species occupancy models capable of representing the effects of large-scale disturbances on habitat supply at both the stand and landscape levels of habitat management. The resultant occupancy maps are also useful when integrated into various strategic planning initiatives including species recovery, silvicultural investments, and long-term conservation planning."
climate change and western public lands: a survey of us. federal land managers on the status of adaptation efforts.,"Climate change and its associated consequences pose an increasing risk to public lands in the western United States. High-level mandates currently require federal agencies to begin planning for adaptation, but the extent to which these mandates have resulted in policies being implemented that affect on the ground practices is unclear. To examine the status of adaptation efforts, we conducted an original survey and semistructured interviews with land managers from the four major federal land management agencies in the U.S. states of Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming. The survey was designed to examine current planning for adaptation on public lands and how it differs from prior planning, the major challenges facing land managers in this region, the major barriers preventing managers from planning for adaptation, and the major hurdles associated with implementing adaptation plans. Our results show that some adaptation planning is currently taking place, but that few adaptation projects have made it to the implementation phase. Overall, respondents considered lack of information at relevant scales, budget constraints, lack of specific agency direction, and lack of useful information to be the most common barriers to adaption planning. Budget constraints, lack of perceived importance to the public, and lack of public awareness or demand to take action were reported to be the biggest hurdles to implementation of adaptation projects. Agencies showed differing levels of adaptation activity, and reported different barriers to adaptation and hurdles to implementation. Reasons for the differences and implications for future research and policy are discussed."
"sensitivity of berry productivity to climatic variation in the cabinet-yaak grizzly bear recovery zone, northwest united states, 1989-2010","Berry-producing shrubs are culturally, economically, and ecologically important for both people and animals in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. We examined huckleberry (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Vaccinium membranaceum</i>) and serviceberry (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Amelanchier alnifolia</i>) productivity across the Cabinet-Yaak grizzly bear recovery zone in Northern Idaho and Western Montana. An index of annual berry productivity was measured at field plots from 1989 to 2010. Temperature, precipitation, and snow indices were derived from nearby Snowpack Telemetry (SNOTEL) stations. Huckleberry production was highest during cool springs with high July diurnal temperature ranges. April-June growing-degree days and July temperature range explain 70% of the inter-annual variability in huckleberry productivity. Serviceberry production was correlated with maximum snow-water equivalent and April-June growing-degree days, which explained 86% of the variance in annual serviceberry production. These models show potential to forecast annual berry production and to anticipate potential bear-human interactions. Further development of models is essential to better predict the potential changes in important wildlife resources in the context of climate change. Published 2012.

wood microsites at timberline-alpine meadow borders: implications for conifer seedling regeneration and alpine meadow conifer invasion,"The importance of climate warming on forests is recognized worldwide and has increased attention on the significance of both timberline advance and alpine meadow invasion by forests. Successful seedling regeneration in alpine meadows depends on availability of suitable substrates, or microsites, for seedling establishment. We sought to determine whether wood microsites (i.e., nurse logs), which are regeneration sites in Pacific Northwest subalpine forests, promoted regeneration at timberline-alpine meadow borders. To determine the ecological role of wood microsites, we examined mechanisms forming wood microsites; compared density, survival, and percent nitrogen content of seedlings growing on wood microsites to adjacent soil substrates; and compared substrate moisture, temperature, and percent nitrogen content. Wood microsites, at 13 of 14 randomly selected sites, were characterized by highly decayed downed wood (&gt;75% decay class five) originating from tree fall (66%), snow avalanches (17%), forest fires (15%), and by human cutting (2%). Although no differences in percent nitrogen content were detected, greater seedling densities, greater seedling survival, higher temperatures, and higher moisture contents were found on wood microsites compared to adjacent soil. We suggest that greater seedling density and seedling survival on wood microsites was associated with factors including heightened moisture and increased temperature. Assuming sustained downed wood input from timberline trees and continued viable seed input, we expect wood microsites will facilitate accelerated alpine meadow conifer invasion via wood microsites associated with climate warming."
biodiversity indicators show climate change will alter vegetation in parks and protected areas,"While multifaceted, a chief aim when designating parks and protected areas is to support the preservation of biological diversity, in part, through representing and conserving the full range of landscape conditions observed throughout a representative area. Parks and protected areas are, however, typically developed using a static interpretation of current biodiversity and landscape conditions. The observed and potential climate change impacts to biodiversity have created a need to also contemplate how parks and protected areas will respond to climate change and how these areas will represent the future range of landscape conditions. To assess change in biodiversity, broad-scale ecosystem information can be sourced from indirect remotely sensed indicators. Quantifying biodiversity through indirect indicators allows characterization of inter-relationships between climate and biodiversity. Such characterizations support the assessment of possible implications of climatic change, as the indicators can be generated using modeled forecasts of future climatic conditions. In this paper we model and map impacts of climate change on British Columbia's parks and protected areas by quantifying change in a number of remotely sensed indicators of biodiversity. These indicators are based on the measured amount of incoming solar energy used by vegetation and map the overall annual energy utilization, variability (seasonality), and latent or baseline energy. We compare current conditions represented by parks and protected areas, to those forecasted in the year 2065. Our results indicate that parks and protected areas are forecasted to become more productive and less seasonal, due to increased vegetation productivity in higher elevation environments. While increased vegetation productivity may be beneficial for biodiversity overall, these changes will be particularly problematic for sensitive and specialist species. Future gaps in vegetation conditions protected by parks and protected areas are observed in the eastern edge of the Rocky Mountains and the central interior region of British Columbia. Protected areas along the Coast Mountains, Vancouver Island highlands, and the Rocky Mountains show the greatest levels of change in the biodiversity indicators, including decreasing seasonality, with the Mountain Hemlock ecozone most at risk. Examples of large parks that are predicted to experience rapid change in vegetation characteristics include Strathcona, Garabaldi, and Kitlope. Our maps of future spatial distributions of indirect biodiversity indicators fill a gap in information products available for adaptive parks management and provide an opportunity for dialogue and further research on the use of future scenarios of landscape conditions in conservation planning."
climate change opportunities for idaho's irrigation supply and deliveries,"The Snowmelt Runoff Model (SRM) was used to simulate timing and magnitude of runoff for six climate scenarios (2030 and 2080 'Wet', 'Middle', and 'Dry'). The water supply results from SRM were run through a Southern Idaho reservoir operation and water rights allocation model (MODSIM). The 2030-Dry and 2080-Dry scenarios produce supply deficits relative to the current climate of 5.4%, and 1.9%, respectively, for which the corresponding irrigation water delivery reductions were 1.7% and 2.7%. In contrast, the 2030-Wet, 2030-Mid, 2080-Wet, and 2080-Mid climate change scenarios increased water supply by 13.4%, 0.5%, 19.5%, and 5%, respectively, for which water deliveries increased by 0.41%, 0.04%, 0.34% and 0.14%, respectively. Idaho's irrigation delivery and storage system can ameliorate the risk of dry climate change, but is incapable of storing and delivering the increased water supplied by the wet climate change scenarios. This is an opportunity worth exploring."
climate-moderated responses to wildfire by macroinvertebrates and basal food resources in montane wilderness streams,"Changes in both climate and fire frequency have been documented but the combined effects of these are poorly understood in freshwater systems, thus making it imperative for long-term studies in pristine habitats to quantify climate-mediated wildfire effects in lotic systems. We quantified the response of invertebrates and basal food resources in 6 wilderness streams in central Idaho USA for 8 years pre-fire and 5 years post-fire. We found that a shift in climate toward increased temperature and reduced peaks in snow-melt runoff moderated the effects of wildfire on basal food resources and altered invertebrate community structure and annual variation. Taxon richness significantly increased over the 13-year study period at all sites regardless of fire. Post-fire changes were accompanied by an increase in the relative abundances of chironomid midges and <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Baetis</i> mayflies, which generally are regarded as disturbance-adapted taxa. Ordination analysis of invertebrate community biomass showed that both unburned and burned streams differed between pre- and post-fire years and combined, our results suggest that the effects of climate ameliorated the effects of fire. We found significant correlations between community structure and climatic variables of precipitation, temperature, and discharge in all streams. Our findings support previous studies that attribute a large part of negative fire effects on stream ecosystems to major increases in runoff from sparsely vegetated uplands and attendant restructuring of channels and substrata. However, we found during a period of climate warming and reduction in snow-melt runoff, these adverse effects were suppressed resulting in increases in basal food resources and invertebrate density and biomass following fire. Our results show the importance of long-term studies in quantifying community changes in responses to disturbance under a changing climate in lotic ecosystems."
"analysis of long-term weather, snow, and avalanche data at glacier national park, bc., canada","Long-term changes of the global climate system have been observed. However, the effect of long-term changes in the climate system on avalanche hazard in mountainous areas remains inconclusive. For this study we analyzed long-term weather, snow cover, and avalanche data from Glacier National Park. Weather and snow cover data were-measured at two sites (1315 m and 1905 m a.s.l). The avalanche data were observed along the section of the Trans Canada Highway within the park. Meteorological data were analyzed by winter season, i.e. early, mid and late winter, represented by three-month periods between September and May. Increasing trend's were found for the mean seasonal air temperature at both stations during the mid season. Trends for the solid precipitation rate were not significant, indicating no trend towards more rain events. Decreasing trends of the maximum snow depth were only found for the lower elevation station at Rogers Pass for the mid and late season, which is consistent with decreasing trends for all seasons of the mean 24-hour new snow amounts at the lower elevation and for the mid season at the higher elevation station at Mt. Fidelity. Due to uncertainty arising from changes in explosive control, we draw no conclusions regarding the regional change of avalanche activity. However, the weather and snowpack trends observed in Glacier National Park are consistent with longer time series from mountains With similar latitudes and elevations in France and Switzerland.

floodplain forest succession reveals fluvial processes: a hydrogeomorphic model for temperate riparian woodlands,"River valley floodplains are physically-dynamic environments where fluvial processes determine habitat gradients for riparian vegetation. These zones support trees and shrubs whose life stages are adapted to specific habitat types and consequently forest composition and successional stage reflect the underlying hydrogeomorphic processes and history. In this study we investigated woodland vegetation composition, successional stage and habitat properties, and compared these with physically-based indicators of hydraulic processes. We thus sought to develop a hydrogeomorphic model to evaluate riparian woodland condition based on the spatial mosaic of successional phases of the floodplain forest. The study investigated free-flowing and dam-impacted reaches of the Kootenai and Flathead Rivers, in Idaho and Montana, USA and British Columbia, Canada. The analyses revealed strong correspondence between vegetation assessments and metrics of fluvial processes indicating morphodynamics (erosion and shear stress), inundation and depth to groundwater. The results indicated that common successional stages generally occupied similar hydraulic environments along the different river segments. Comparison of the spatial patterns between the free-flowing and regulated reaches revealed greater deviation from the natural condition for the braided channel segment than for the meandering segment. This demonstrates the utility of the hydrogeomorphic approach and suggests that riparian woodlands along braided channels could have lower resilience than those along meandering channels and might be more vulnerable to influences such as from river damming or climate change."
"floristic similarity, diversity and endemism as indicators of refugia characteristics and needs in the west","The floras of mountain ranges, and their similarity, beta diversity and endemism, are indicative of processes of community assembly; they are also the initial conditions for coming disassembly and reassembly in response to climate change. As such, these characteristics can inform thinking on refugia. The published floras or approximations for 42 mountain ranges in the three major mountain systems (Sierra-Cascades, Rocky Mountains and Great Basin ranges) across the western USA and southwestern Canada were analysed. The similarity is higher among the ranges of the Rockies while equally low among the ranges of the Sierra-Cascades and Great Basin. Mantel correlations of similarity with geographic distance are also higher for the Rocky Mountains. Endemism is relatively high, but is highest in the Sierra-Cascades (due to the Sierra Nevada as the single largest range) and lowest in the Great Basin, where assemblages are allochthonous. These differences indicate that the geologic substrates of the Cascade volcanoes, which are much younger than any others, play a role in addition to geographic isolation in community assembly. The pattern of similarity and endemism indicates that the ranges of the Cascades will not function well as stepping stones and the endemic species that they harbor may need more protection than those of the Rocky Mountains. The geometry of the ranges is complemented by geology in setting the stage for similarity and the potential for refugia across the West. Understanding the geographic template as initial conditions for the future can guide the forecast of refugia and related monitoring or protection efforts."
"non-stationary temporal response of mountain hemlock growth to climatic variability in the north cascade range, washington, usa","A stationary response of tree radial growth to climatic variables is assumed as a basis for climatic reconstructions and future growth projections in response to climate change. Mountain hemlock (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Tsuga mertensiana</i> (Bong.) Carri������re) trees on the western slopes of the North Cascade Range (Washington, USA) were examined for stability in growth response to climatic influences at a small spatial scale. Moving correlation functions demonstrate that climate-growth interactions are non-stationary over time, alternating between periods of significant and non-significant responses. Correlations between growth and winter precipitation have weakened, becoming statistically insignificant in the last decade, but correlations with spring temperature and previous-year summer temperature have strengthened, becoming statistically significant. The Pacific Decadal Oscillation influences patterns in climate-growth correlations but does not seem to account for the most recent changes in correlation strength. At an interannual scale, growth differs between El Ni������o Southern Oscillation phases, specifically between El Ni������o and La Ni������a years and between La Ni������a and neutral phase years. The variability in growth response to climate at interannual and interdecadal time frames, especially with the climate changes emerging in recent decades, will challenge the reliability and accuracy of reconstruction and predictive models."
assessing the impacts of projected climate change on biodiversity in the protected areas of western north america,"Protected areas are a fundamental component of many conservation strategies. They safeguard some of the best examples of unfragmented natural landscapes in many regions, provide important habitat for rare and threatened species, and serve as a refuge from a human-dominated world. As climates continue to change, species distributions, ecological communities, and ecosystems will be altered. An understanding of the trends in these changes can allow protected area managers to develop more effective climate-adaptation strategies. Here, we quantify the relative amount of projected potential climate-driven ecological change across a protected area network by calculating three metrics. We assessed future projected changes in temperature and precipitation, shifts in major vegetation types, and vertebrate species turnover for the protected areas of the Pacific Northwestern region of North America. In general, the degree of projected change in the three metrics followed a longitudinal gradient from the Pacific coast inland toward the continental interior. Protected areas expected to experience the least change are at low elevations near the coast and throughout the Coastal Mountains, whereas areas expected to experience the most change are found at higher elevations in the Rocky Mountains and Great Basin regions. The resulting spatial variation in these impact measures underscores the importance of developing appropriate, location-specific, climate-adaptation strategies in response to disparate trends in future environmental change."
"linkages between hydrological drought, climate indices and human activities: a case study in the columbia river basin","It is of great importance to investigate links between hydrological drought and climate indices, which helps to further reveal the cause of hydrological drought from a perspective of climate change, thus helping guiding future drought prediction and control. For a case study in the Columbia River basin, the Standardized Streamflow Index (SSI) was employed to characterize hydrological drought. The heuristic segmentation method was applied to identify change points of annual streamflow series spanning 1960-2012 in the Columbia River basin, and the cross-wavelet analysis was utilized to reveal the correlations between monthly climate indices and SSI. The primary results are as following: (1) monthly SSI has a statistically significantly increasing trend in November and December and a noticeably decreasing trend in June and July in the main stream of the basin; (2) generally, hydrological drought risk in this basin is high, and that in the Snake River is higher than the main stream of the Columbia River; (3) El Ni������o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Arctic Oscillation (AO) play a major role in affecting hydrological drought in the Columbia River basin, and ENSO index mainly affects SSI at a relatively short time scale (2-7 years), while AO primarily impacts SSI at a relatively long time scale (more than 10 years); (4) anthropogenic activities intensify hydrological drought in the Columbia River basin, and they primarily influence the linkages between climate indices and hydrological drought at intra-annual scale (less than 12 months), however, which do not change the basic pattern of their correlations."
relative importance of climate and mountain pine beetle outbreaks on the occurrence of large wildfires in the western usa,"Extensive outbreaks of bark beetles have killed trees across millions of hectares of forests and woodlands in western North America. These outbreaks have led to spirited scientific, public, and policy debates about consequential increases in fire risk, especially in the wildland-urban interface (WUI), where homes and communities are at particular risk from wildfires. At the same time, large wildfires have become more frequent across this region. Widespread expectations that outbreaks increase extent, severity, and/or frequency of wildfires are based partly on visible and dramatic changes in foliar moisture content and other fuel properties following outbreaks, as well as associated modeling projections. A competing explanation is that increasing wildfires are driven primarily by climatic extremes, which are becoming more common with climate change. However, the relative importance of bark beetle outbreaks vs. climate on fire occurrence has not been empirically examined across very large areas and remains poorly understood. The most extensive outbreaks of tree-killing insects across the western United States have been of mountain pine beetle (MPB; <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Dendroctonus ponderosae</i>), which have killed trees over &gt;650,000 km<sup xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">2</sup>, mostly in forests dominated by lodgepole pine (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Pinus contorta</i>). We show that outbreaks of MPB in lodgepole pine forests of the western United States have been less important than climatic variability for the occurrence of large fires over the past 29 years. In lodgepole pine forests in general, as well as those in the WUI, occurrence of large fires was determined primarily by current and antecedent high temperatures and low precipitation but was unaffected by preceding outbreaks. Trends of increasing co-occurrence of wildfires and outbreaks are due to a common climatic driver rather than interactions between these disturbances. Reducing wildfire risk hinges on addressing the underlying climatic drivers rather than treating beetle-affected forests."
do insect outbreaks reduce the severity of subsequent forest fires?,"Understanding the causes and consequences of rapid environmental change is an essential scientific frontier, particularly given the threat of climate-and land use-induced changes in disturbance regimes. In western North America, recent widespread insect outbreaks and wildfires have sparked acute concerns about potential insect-fire interactions. Although previous research shows that insect activity typically does not increase wildfire likelihood, key uncertainties remain regarding insect effects on wildfire severity (i.e., ecological impact). Recent assessments indicate that outbreak severity and burn severity are not strongly associated, but these studies have been limited to specific insect or fire events. Here, we present a regional census of large wildfire severity following outbreaks of two prevalent bark beetle and defoliator species, mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) and western spruce budworm (Choristoneura freemani), across the US Pacific Northwest. Wefirst quantify insect effects on burn severity with spatial modeling at the fire event scale and then evaluate how these effects vary across the full population of insect-fire events (n = 81 spanning 1987-2011). In contrast to common assumptions of positive feedbacks, we find that insects generally reduce the severity of subsequent wildfires. Specific effects vary with insect type and timing, but both insects decrease the abundance of live vegetation susceptible to wildfire at multiple time lags. By dampening subsequent burn severity, native insects could buffer rather than exacerbate fire regime changes expected due to land use and climate change. In light of these findings, we recommend a precautionary approach when designing and implementing forest management policies intended to reduce wildfire hazard and increase resilience to global change."
the natural history of the south hills crossbill in relation to its impending extinction,"Increasingly, the species that we discover will be uncommon, area restricted, and vulnerable to extinction. I describe the natural history of a newly discovered seed-eating finch from the Rocky Mountain region, the South Hills crossbill (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Loxia curvirostra</i> complex). It relies on seeds in the closed cones of the fire-adapted Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Pinus contorta latifolia</i>) and is found only in the higher elevations of two small mountain ranges in southern Idaho. Here crossbills and pine are engaged in a coevolutionary arms race. Although most of the seeds remain secured within the cones for decades until the heat of a stand-replacing fire causes the cone scales to separate, seeds become accessible to crossbills slowly as cones weather and gaps form between some of the scales. However, hot days (���������32������C), especially four or more hot days, seem to mimic the effect of fire, apparently causing the immediate release of a fraction of the seeds. Such events caused a 20% annual decline in crossbills that lasted up to 4 years and an 80% decline in the population between 2003 and 2011. This is an example of a novel trophic mismatch between a consumer and its resource caused by a shift in the phenology of the resource arising from climate change. Not only do these phenological shifts have the potential to cause seed consumers to decline, these shifts are also likely to cause reduced recruitment of the plants. The South Hills crossbill is especially vulnerable and will likely go extinct this century before lodgepole pine is extirpated from the South Hills."
impacts of projected climate changes on streamflow and sediment transport for three snowmelt-dominated rivers in the interior pacific northwest,"Anthropogenic climate change is likely to have significant impacts on river systems, particularly on rivers dominated by seasonal snowmelt. In addition to altering the timing and magnitude of streamflow, climate change can affect the energy available to transport sediment, as well as the availability of sediment to be transported. These hydrologic changes are sensitive to local climate, which is largely controlled by topography, but climate models cannot resolve processes at these scales. Here, I investigate impacts of climate change on streamflow and suspended-sediment transport for three snowmelt-dominated rivers in the interior Pacific Northwest - the Tucannon River in Washington and the South Fork Coeur d'Alene and Red rivers in Idaho - using downscaled climate simulations from regional climate models (a range of three models plus an ensemble average) to drive a basin-scale hydrologic model. The results indicate that climate change is likely to amplify the annual cycle of river discharge, producing higher winter discharge (increases in ensemble mean January discharge ranging from 4.1% to 34.4% for the three rivers), an earlier spring snowmelt peak (by approximately one month), and lower summer discharge (decreases in ensemble mean July discharge ranging from 5.2% to 47.2%), relative to a late 20th-century baseline. The magnitude of the largest simulated flood under the ensemble-average climate change scenario increases by 0.6-41.6% across the three rivers. Simulated changes in suspended-sediment transport generally follow the changes in streamflow. These changes in discharge and sediment transport will likely produce significant impacts on the study rivers, including changes in flooding, physical habitat, and river morphology."
high and dry: post-fire tree seedling establishment in subalpine forests decreases with post-fire drought and large stand-replacing burn patches,"Aim: Climate warming and increased wildfire activity are hypothesized to catalyse biogeographical shifts, reducing the resilience of fire-prone forests world-wide. Two key mechanisms underpinning hypotheses are: (1) reduced seed availability in large stand-replacing burn patches, and (2) reduced seedling establishment/survival after post-fire drought. We tested for regional evidence consistent with these mechanisms in an extensive fire-prone forest biome by assessing post-fire tree seedling establishment, a key indicator of forest resilience. Location: Subalpine forests, US Rocky Mountains. Methods: We analysed post-fire tree seedling establishment from 184 field plots where stand-replacing forest fires were followed by varying post-fire climate conditions. Generalized linear mixed models tested how establishment rates varied with post-fire drought severity and distance to seed source (among other relevant factors) for tree species with contrasting post-fire regeneration adaptations. Results Total post-fire tree seedling establishment (all species combined) declined sharply with greater post-fire drought severity and with greater distance to seed sources (i.e. the interior of burn patches). Effects varied among key species groups. For conifers that dominate present-day subalpine forests (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Picea engelmannii</i>, <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Abies lasiocarpa</i>), post-fire seedling establishment declined sharply with both factors. One exception was serotinous <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Pinus contorta</i>, which did not vary with either factor. For montane species expected to move upslope under future climate change (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Larix occidentalis</i>, <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Pseudotsuga menziesii</i>, <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Populus tremuloides</i>) and upper treeline species (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Pinus albicaulis</i>), establishment was unrelated to either factor. Greater post-fire tree seedling establishment on cooler/wetter aspects suggested local topographic refugia during post-fire droughts. Main conclusions: If future drought and wildfire patterns manifest as expected, post-fire tree seedling establishment of species that currently characterize subalpine forests could be substantially reduced. Compensatory increases from lower montane and upper treeline species may partially offset these reductions, but our data suggest important near- to mid-term shifts in the composition and structure of high-elevation forests under continued climate warming and increased wildfire activity."
climate influences on whitebark pine mortality from mountain pine beetle in the greater yellowstone ecosystem,"Extensive mortality of whitebark pine, beginning in the early to mid-2000s, occurred in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE) of the western USA, primarily from mountain pine beetle but also from other threats such as white pine blister rust. The climatic drivers of this recent mortality and the potential for future whitebark pine mortality from mountain pine beetle are not well understood, yet are important considerations in whether to list whitebark pine as a threatened or endangered species. We sought to increase the understanding of climate influences on mountain pine beetle outbreaks in whitebark pine forests, which are less well understood than in lodgepole pine, by quantifying climate-beetle relationships, analyzing climate influences during the recent outbreak, and estimating the suitability of future climate for beetle outbreaks. We developed a statistical model of the probability of whitebark pine mortality in the GYE that included temperature effects on beetle development and survival, precipitation effects on host tree condition, beetle population size, and stand characteristics. Estimated probability of whitebark pine mortality increased with higher winter minimum temperature, indicating greater beetle winter survival; higher fall temperature, indicating synchronous beetle emergence; lower two-year summer precipitation, indicating increased potential for host tree stress; increasing beetle populations; stand age; and increasing percent composition of whitebark pine within a stand. The recent outbreak occurred during a period of higher-than-normal regional winter temperatures, suitable fall temperatures, and low summer precipitation. In contrast to lodgepole pine systems, area with mortality was linked to precipitation variability even at high beetle populations. Projections from climate models indicate future climate conditions will likely provide favorable conditions for beetle outbreaks within nearly all current whitebark pine habitat in the GYE by the middle of this century. Therefore, when surviving and regenerating trees reach ages suitable for beetle attack, there is strong potential for continued whitebark pine mortality due to mountain pine beetle."
long-term post-disturbance forest recovery in the greater yellowstone ecosystem analyzed using landsat time series stack,"Forest recovery from past disturbance is an integral process of ecosystem carbon cycles, and remote sensing provides an effective tool for tracking forest disturbance and recovery over large areas. Although the disturbance products (tracking the conversion from forest to non-forest type) derived using the Landsat Time Series Stack-Vegetation Change Tracker (LTSS-VCT) algorithm have been validated extensively for mapping forest disturbances across the United States, the ability of this approach to characterize long-term post-disturbance recovery (the conversion from non-forest to forest) has yet to be assessed. In this study, the LTSS-VCT approach was applied to examine long-term (up to 24 years) post-disturbance forest spectral recovery following stand-clearing disturbances (fire and harvests) in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE). Using high spatial resolution images from Google Earth, we validated the detectable forest recovery status mapped by VCT by year 2011. Validation results show that the VCT was able to map long-term post-disturbance forest recovery with overall accuracy of ���������80% for different disturbance types and forest types in the GYE. Harvested areas in the GYE have higher percentages of forest recovery than burned areas by year 2011, and National Forests land generally has higher recovery rates compared with National Parks. The results also indicate that forest recovery is highly related with forest type, elevation and environmental variables such as soil type. Findings from this study can provide valuable insights for ecosystem modeling that aim to predict future carbon dynamics by integrating fine scale forest recovery conditions in GYE, in the face of climate change. With the availability of the VCT product nationwide, this approach can also be applied to examine long-term post-disturbance forest recovery in other study regions across the U.S."
potential influence of wildfire in modulating climate-induced forest redistribution in a central rocky mountain landscape,"Introduction: Climate change is expected to impose significant tension on the geographic distribution of tree species. Yet, tree species range shifts may be delayed by their long life spans, capacity to withstand long periods of physiological stress, and dispersal limitations. Wildfire could theoretically break this biological inertia by killing forest canopies and facilitating species redistribution under changing climate. We investigated the capacity of wildfire to modulate climate-induced tree redistribution across a montane landscape in the central Rocky Mountains under three climate scenarios (contemporary and two warmer future climates) and three wildfire scenarios (representing historical, suppressed, and future fire regimes). Methods: Distributions of four common tree species were projected over 90 years by pairing a climate niche model with a forest landscape simulation model that simulates species dispersal, establishment, and mortality under alternative disturbance regimes and climate scenarios. Results: Three species (Douglas-fir, lodgepole pine, subalpine fir) declined in abundance over time, due to climate-driven contraction in area suitable for establishment, while one species (ponderosa pine) was unable to exploit climate-driven expansion of area suitable for establishment. Increased fire frequency accelerated declines in area occupied by Douglas-fir, lodgepole pine, and subalpine fir, and it maintained local abundance but not range expansion of ponderosa pine. Conclusions: Wildfire may play a larger role in eliminating these conifer species along trailing edges of their distributions than facilitating establishment along leading edges, in part due to dispersal limitations and interspecific competition, and future populations may increasingly depend on persistence in locations unfavorable for their establishment."
recent tree mortality in the western united states from bark beetles and forest fires,"Forests are substantially influenced by disturbances, and therefore accurate information about the location, timing, and magnitude of disturbances is important for understanding effects. In the western United States, the two major disturbance agents that kill trees are wildfire and bark beetle outbreaks. Our objective was to quantify mortality area (canopy area of killed trees), which better represents impacts than affected area (by beetles) or burn perimeter area, and characterize patterns in space and time. We based our estimates on aerial surveys for bark beetles and the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity database (from satellite imagery) for fires. We found that during the last three decades, bark beetle-caused mortality area was 6.6 Mha (range of estimates, 0.64-7.8 Mha; 7.1% [0.7-8.4%] of the forested area in the western United States) and fire-caused mortality area was 2.7-5.9 Mha (2.9-6.3%). Mortality area from beetles and fire was similar to recent harvest area from a national report. Although large outbreaks and fires occurred before 2000, substantially more trees were killed since then. In several forest types, mortality area exceeded 20% of the total forest type area. Our mortality area estimates allow for comparisons among disturbance types and improved assessment of the effects of tree mortality."
mountain hemlock growth responds to climatic variability at annual and decadal time scales,"Improved understanding of tree growth responses to climate is needed to model and predict forest ecosystem responses to current and future climatic variability. We used dendroecological methods to study the effects of climatic variability on radial growth of a subalpine conifer, mountain hemlock (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Tsuga mertensiana</i>). Tree-ring chronologies were developed for 31 sites, spanning the latitudinal and elevational ranges of mountain hemlock in the Pacific Northwest. Factor analysis was used to identify common patterns of interannual growth variability among the chronologies, and correlation and regression analyses were used to identify climatic factors associated with that variability. Factor analysis identified three common growth patterns, representing groups of sites with different climate-growth relationships. At high-elevation and midrange sites in Washington and northern Oregon, growth was negatively correlated with spring snowpack depth, and positively correlated with growth-year summer temperature and the winter Pacific Decadal Oscillation index (PDO). In southern Oregon, growth was negatively correlated with spring snowpack depth and previous summer temperature, and positively correlated with previous summer precipitation. At the low-elevation sites, growth was mostly insensitive to annual climatic variability but displayed sensitivity to decadal variability in the PDO opposite to that found at high-elevation sites. Mountain hemlock growth appears to be limited by late snowmelt, short growing seasons, and cool summer temperatures throughout much of its range in the Pacific Northwest. Earlier snowmelt, higher summer temperatures, and lower summer precipitation in southern Oregon produce conditions under which growth is limited by summer temperature and/or soil water availability. Increasing atmospheric CO<sub xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">2</sub> concentrations could produce warmer temperatures and reduced snowpack depths in the next century. Such changes would likely increase mountain hemlock growth and productivity throughout much of its range in Washington and northern Oregon. Increased summer drought stress and reduced productivity would be likely, however, in mountain hemlock forests of southern Oregon and near the species lower elevation limit at some sites."
growth responses of subalpine fir to climatic variability in the pacific northwest,"We studied regional variation in growth-limiting factors and responses to climatic variability in subalpine forests by analysing growth patterns for 28 tree-ring growth chronologies from subalpine fir (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Abies lasiocarpa</i>) stands in the Cascade and Olympic Mountains (Washington and Oregon, USA). Factor analysis identified four distinct time series of common growth patterns; the dominant growth pattern at any site varied with annual precipitation and temperature (elevation). Throughout much of the region, growth is negatively correlated with winter precipitation and spring snowpack depth, indicating that growth is limited primarily by short growing seasons. On the driest and warmest sites, growth is negatively correlated with previous summer temperature, suggesting that low summer soil moisture limits growth. Growth patterns in two regions were sensitive to climatic variability associated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, apparently responding to low-frequency variation in spring snowpack and summer soil moisture (one negatively, one positively). This regional-scale analysis shows that subalpine fir growth in the Cascades and Olympics is limited by different climatic factors in different subregional climates. Climate-growth relationships are similar to those for a co-occurring species, mountain hemlock (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Tsuga mertensiana</i>), suggesting broad biogeographic patterns of response to climatic variability and change by subalpine forest ecosystems in the Pacific Northwest."
trends in snow water equivalent in the pacific northwest and their climatic causes,"Observations of snow water equivalent (SWE) in the Pacific Northwest (Idaho, Oregon and Washington in their entirety, southern British Columbia and Monatan west of the continental divide) were examined and compared with variability and trends in temperature and precipitation at nearby climate stations. At most locations, especially below ���������1800 m, substantial declines in SWE coincided with significant increases in temperature, and occurred in spite of increases in precipitation."
implications of projected climate change for groundwater recharge in the western united states,"Existing studies on the impacts of climate change on groundwater recharge are either global or basin/location-specific. The global studies lack the specificity to inform decision making, while the local studies do little to clarify potential changes over large regions (major river basins, states, or groups of states), a scale often important in the development of water policy. An analysis of the potential impact of climate change on groundwater recharge across the western United States (west of 100 longitude) is presented synthesizing existing studies and applying current knowledge of recharge processes and amounts. Eight representative aquifers located across the region were evaluated. For each aquifer published recharge budget components were converted into four standard recharge mechanisms: diffuse, focused, irrigation, and mountain-systems recharge. Future changes in individual recharge mechanisms and total recharge were then estimated for each aquifer. Model-based studies of projected climate-change effects on recharge were available and utilized for half of the aquifers. For the remainder, forecasted changes in temperature and precipitation were logically propagated through each recharge mechanism producing qualitative estimates of direction of changes in recharge only (not magnitude). Several key patterns emerge from the analysis. First, the available estimates indicate average declines of 10-20% in total recharge across the southern aquifers, but with a wide range of uncertainty that includes no change. Second, the northern set of aquifers will likely incur little change to slight increases in total recharge. Third, mountain system recharge is expected to decline across much of the region due to decreased snow pack, with that impact lessening with higher elevation and latitude. Factors contributing the greatest uncertainty in the estimates include: (1) limited studies quantitatively coupling climate projections to recharge estimation methods using detailed, process-based numerical models; (2) a generally poor understanding of hydrologic flowpaths and processes in mountain systems; (3) difficulty predicting the response of focused recharge to potential changes in the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events; and (4) unconstrained feedbacks between climate, irrigation practices, and recharge in highly developed aquifer systems.

"changes in the chemistry of lakes and precipitation in high-elevation national parks in the western united states, 1985-1999","High-elevation lakes in the western United States are sensitive to atmospheric deposition of sulfur and nitrogen due to fast hydrologic flushing rates, short growing seasons, an abundance of exposed bedrock, and a lack of well-developed soils. This sensitivity is reflected in the dilute chemistry of the lakes, which was documented in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Western Lake Survey of 1985. Sixty-nine lakes in seven national parks sampled during the 1985 survey were resampled during fall 1999 to investigate possible decadal-scale changes in lake chemistry. In most lakes, SO<sub xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">4</sub> concentrations were slightly lower in 1999 than in 1985, consistent with a regional decrease in precipitation SO<sub xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">4</sub> concentrations and in SO<sub xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">2</sub> emissions in the western United States. Nitrate concentrations also tended to be slightly lower in 1999 than in 1985, in contrast with generally stable or increasing inorganic N deposition in the west. Differences in alkalinity were variable among parks but were relatively consistent within each park. Possible effects of annual and seasonal-scale variations in precipitation amount on lake chemistry were evaluated based on climate data available for the parks and an analysis of climatic effects at two research watersheds with long-term records. Results suggest that rain prior to sampling in 1985 may have caused elevated NO<sub xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">3</sub> in some lakes due to direct runoff of precipitation and flushing of NO<sub xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">3</sub> from alpine soils, which may explain some of the decrease in NO<sub xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">3</sub> concentrations observed in survey lakes."
complex interactions shaping aspen dynamics in the greater yellowstone ecosystem,"Loss of aspen (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Populus tremuloides</i>) has generated concern for aspen persistence across much of the western United States. However, most studies of aspen change have been at local scales and our understanding of aspen dynamics at broader scales is limited. At local scales, aspen loss has been attributed to fire exclusion, ungulate herbivory, and climate change. Understanding the links between biophysical setting and aspen presence, growth, and dynamics is necessary to develop a large-scale perspective on aspen dynamics. Specific objectives of this research were to (1) map aspen distribution and abundance across the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE), (2) measure aspen change in the GYE over the past 50 years (3) determine if aspen loss occurs in particular biophysical settings and (4) investigate the links between biophysical setting and aspen presence, growth, and change in canopy cover. We found that aspen is rare in the GYE, occupying 1.4% of the region. We found an average of 10% aspen loss overall, much lower than that suggested by smaller-scale studies. Aspen loss corresponded with biophysical settings with the lowest aspen growth rates, where aspen was most abundant. The highest aspen growth rates were at the margins of its current distribution, so most aspen occur in biophysical settings less favorable to their growth."
"water, adaptation, and property rights on the snake and klamath rivers","Water demand in a viable economy tends to be dynamic: it changes over time in response to growth, drought, and social policy. Institutional capacity to re-allocate water between users and uses under stress from multiple sources is a key concern. Climate change threatens to add to those stresses in snowmelt systems by changing the timing of runoff and possibly increasing the severity and duration of drought. This article examines Snake and Klamath River institutions for their ability to resolve conflict induced by demand growth, drought, and environmental constraints on water use. The study finds that private ownership of water rights has been a major positive factor in successful adaptation, by providing the basis for water marketing and by promoting the use of negotiation and markets rather than politics to resolve water conflict."
climate change implications for wind power resources in the northwest united states,"Using statistically downscaled output from four general circulation models (GCMs), we have investigated scenarios of climate change impacts on wind power generation potential in a five-state region within the Northwest United States (Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington, and Wyoming). All GCM simulations were extracted from the standardized set of runs created for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Analysis of model runs for the 20th century (20c3m) simulations revealed that the direct output of wind statistics from these models is of relatively poor quality compared with observations at airport weather stations within each state. When the GCM output was statistically downscaled, the resulting estimates of current climate wind statistics are substantially better. Furthermore, in looking at the GCM wind statistics for two IPCC future climate scenarios from the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES A1B and A2), there was significant disagreement in the direct model output from the four GCMs. When statistical downscaling was applied to the future climate simulations, a more coherent story unfolded related to the likely impact of climate change on the region's wind power resource. Specifically, the results suggest that summertime wind speeds in the Northwest may decrease by 5-10%, while wintertime wind speeds may decrease by relatively little, or possibly increase slightly. When these wind statistics are projected to typical turbine hub heights and nominal wind turbine power curves are applied, the impact of the climate change scenarios on wind power may be as high as a 40% reduction in summertime generation potential."
"long-term fire history from alluvial fan sediments: the role of drought and climate variability, and implications for management of rocky mountain forests","Alluvial fan deposits are widespread and preserve millennial-length records of fire. We used these records to examine changes in fire regimes over the last 2000 years in Yellowstone National Park mixed-conifer forests and drier central Idaho ponderosa pine forests. In Idaho, frequent, small, fire-related erosional events occurred within the Little Ice Age (���������1450-1800 AD), when greater effective moisture probably promoted grass growth and low-severity fires. This regime is consistent with tree-ring records showing generally wetter conditions and frequent fires before European settlement. At higher elevations in Yellowstone, cool conditions limited overall fire activity. Conversely, both Idaho and Yellowstone experienced a peak in fire-related debris flows between ���������950 and 1150 AD. During this generally warmer time, severe multidecadal droughts were interspersed with unusually wet intervals that probably increased forest densities, producing stand-replacing fires. Thus, severe fires are clearly within the natural range of variability in Idaho ponderosa pine forests over longer timescales. Historical records indicate that large burn areas in Idaho correspond with drought intervals within the past 100 years and that burn area has increased markedly since ���������1985. Recent stand-replacing fires in ponderosa pine forests are likely related to both changes in management and increasing temperatures and drought severity during the 20th century."
the relative impact of harvest and fire upon landscape-level dynamics of older forests: lessons from the northwest forest plan,"Interest in preserving older forests at the landscape level has increased in many regions, including the Pacific Northwest of the United States. The Northwest Forest Plan (NWFP) of 1994 initiated a significant reduction in the harvesting of older forests on federal land. We used historical satellite imagery to assess the effect of this reduction in relation to: past harvest rates, management of non-federal forests, and the growing role of fire. Harvest rates in non-federal large-diameter forests (LDF) either decreased or remained stable at relatively high rates following the NWFP, meaning that harvest reductions on federal forests, which cover half of the region, resulted in a significant regional drop in the loss of LDF to harvest. However, increased losses of LDF to fire outweighed reductions in LDF harvest across large areas of the region. Elevated fire levels in the western United States have been correlated to changing climatic conditions, and if recent fire patterns persist, preservation of older forests in dry ecosystems will depend upon practical and coordinated fire management across the landscape."
"predicting landscape sensitivity to present and future floods in the pacific northwest, usa","Floods are the most frequent natural disaster, causing more loss of life and property than any other in the USA. Floods also strongly influence the structure and function of watersheds, stream channels, and aquatic ecosystems. The Pacific Northwest is particularly vulnerable to climatically driven changes in flood frequency and magnitude, because snowpacks that strongly influence flood generation are near the freezing point and thus sensitive to small changes in temperature. To improve predictions of future flooding potential and inform strategies to adapt to these changes, we mapped the sensitivity of landscapes to changes in peak flows due to climate warming across Oregon and Washington. We first developed principal component- based models for predicting peak flows across a range of recurrence intervals (2-, 10-, 25-, 50-, and 100- years) based on historical instantaneous peak flow data from 1000 gauged watersheds in Oregon and Washington. Key predictors of peak flows included drainage area and principal component scores for climate, land cover, soil, and topographic metrics. We then used these regression models to predict future peak flows by perturbing the climate variables based on future climate projections (2020s, 2040s, and 2080s) for the A1B emission scenario. For each recurrence interval, peak flow sensitivities were computed as the ratio of future to current peak flow magnitudes. Our analysis suggests that temperature- induced changes in snowpack dynamics will result in large (>30-40%) increases in peak flow magnitude in some areas, principally the Cascades, Olympics, and Blue Mountains and parts of the western edge of the Rocky Mountains. Flood generation processes in lower elevation areas are less likely to be affected, but some of these areas may be impacted by floodwaters from upstream. These results can assist land, water, and infrastructure managers in identifying watersheds and resources that are particularly vulnerable to increased peak flows and developing plans to increase their resilience.

detection and attribution of streamflow timing changes to climate change in the western united states,"This article applies formal detection and attribution techniques to investigate the nature of observed shifts in the timing of streamflow in the western United States. Previous studies have shown that the snow hydrology of the western United States has changed in the second half of the twentieth century. Such changes manifest themselves in the form of more rain and less snow, in reductions in the snow water contents, and in earlier snowmelt and associated advances in streamflow ""center"" timing (the day in the ""water-year"" on average when half the water-year flow at a point has passed). However, with one exception over a more limited domain, no other study has attempted to formally attribute these changes to anthropogenic increases of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Using the observations together with a set of global climate model simulations and a hydrologic model (applied to three major hydrological regions of the western United States - the California region, the upper Colorado River basin, and the Columbia River basin), it is found that the observed trends toward earlier ""center"" timing of snowmelt-driven streamflows in the western United States since 1950 are detectably different from natural variability (significant at the <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">p</i>&lt;0.05 level). Furthermore, the nonnatural parts of these changes can be attributed confidently to climate changes induced by anthropogenic greenhouse gases, aerosols, ozone, and land use. The signal from the Columbia dominates the analysis, and it is the only basin that showed a detectable signal when the analysis was performed on individual basins. It should be noted that although climate change is an important signal, other climatic processes have also contributed to the hydrologic variability of large basins in the western United States."
"the coastal-disjunct mesic flora in the inland pacific northwest of usa and canada: refugia, dispersal and disequilibrium","Aim: Understanding the history of the mesic-adapted plant species of eastern British Columbia and northern Idaho, disjunct from their main coastal distribution, may suggest how biotas reorganize in the face of climate change and dispersal barriers. For different species, current evidence supports establishment of the disjunction via an inland glacial refugium, via recent dispersal from the coast, or via a combination of both. In this study, the modern distributions of the coastal-disjunct vascular plants are analysed with respect to modern climate to examine how refugia and/or dispersal limitation control regional patterns in species richness. Location: North-west North America. Methods: The distributions of nine tree and 58 understorey species with a coastal-disjunct pattern were compiled on a 50-km grid. The relationship between species richness and an estimate of available moisture was calculated separately for formerly glaciated and unglaciated portions of the coastal and inland regions. Growth habit and dispersal mode were assessed as possible explanatory variables for species distributions. Results: Species richness shows a strong relationship to climate in coastal-unglaciated areas but no relationship to climate in inland-glaciated areas. In inland-glaciated areas, richness is <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">c.</i> 70% lower than that expected from climate. Species with animal-dispersed seeds occupy a larger portion of coastal and inland regions than species with less dispersal potential. Main conclusions: Modern patterns of diversity are consistent with both refugia and dispersal processes in establishing the coastal-disjunct pattern. The inland glacial refugium is marked by locally high diversity and several co-distributed endemics. In the inland-glaciated area, dispersal limitation has constrained diversity despite the nearby refugia. Onset of mesic climate within only the last 3000 years and the low dispersal capacity of many species in the refugium may explain this pattern. This study suggests that vascular plant species will face significant challenges responding to climate change on fragmented landscapes."
predicting effects of hydrologic alteration and climate change on ecosystem metabolism in a western us. river.,"We estimated past and future hydrographs and patterns of ecosystem metabolism in a fifth-order river of the western United States, where water use and climate change are both expected to alter hydrology in the immediate future. We first reconstructed the unregulated hydrograph to estimate how the current hydrograph has been altered. Due to consumptive use, 95% as irrigation, current discharge during summer (July-September) was 70% lower than would occur if the river was unregulated. We then predicted a future hydrograph including effects of consumptive use and climate change; the magnitude of flow changes were minor under this regime relative to those already manifested by consumptive uses. We used time-series regression and a six-year continuous record of open-water metabolism to demonstrate that, under the current hydrologic regime, gross primary production (GPP) was dependent on both water temperature and flow and that ecosystem respiration (ER) was most dependent on temperature. Monte Carlo simulations under the three hydrologic regimes and three temperature scenarios (current, +2������C, +4������C) suggested that flow, but not temperature, may have profound effects on the magnitude of metabolism. Linking temporally detailed analyses of ecological function and hydrology may lead to better understanding and management of changes due to basin-scale water use and/or global-scale climate change."
reconstructing snowmelt in idaho's watershed using historic streamflow records,"In recent decades, a warming climate likely has accelerated the timing of spring snowmelt in the western United States; however, records of the timing of snowmelt typically only extend to the 1980s. Stream gage data can lengthen records of the timing of snowmelt back to the early 1900s, enhancing understanding of past, current, and future climate change on snowmelt-dominated watersheds and associated ecosystems. We used snowpack telemetry data and historic streamflow records to test reconstructions of final snowmelt dates using Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT) wavelet analysis of hydrographs. STFT reconstructions tested against known final snowmelt dates over the last ���������25 years indicate final snowmelt can be determined within������4 days ���������95% of the time and within������7 days 100% of the time. Comparison of the STFT method with the center of timing method indicates that in addition to reconstructing actual snowmelt dates (as opposed to dates associated with the center of timing of streamflow), the STFT method may limit interpretation errors associated with changes in discharge not related to snowmelt. Reconstructions of final snowmelt dates in the Idaho, U.S. study area show intervals of early snowmelt (1920s-1930s), later and less variable snowmelt (1940s-1970s), and both variable and early snowmelt (���������1985-2007). Early and variable snowmelt during the last ���������20 years is associated with large wildfires."
"climatic and morphometric controls on the altitudinal range of glaciers, british columbia, canada","To examine the relation between climate and glacier extent, we compared gridded, monthly temperature and precipitation data to the altitudinal range of glaciers in British Columbia, Canada. We related glacier relief to ablation season temperature (June-August), accumulation season precipitation (September- March), and morphometric variables that included slope, glacier order, and a shape index for 523 alpine glaciers that ranged from 5 to 15 km<sup xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">2</sup> in surface area. A 1������C increase in mean June-August temperature equates to a 109 to 182 m decrease in glacier relief, and a 1 mm increase in mean monthly September- March precipitation equates to a 0.78 to 2.20 m increase in glacier relief. The most important morphometric controls on this glacier-climate relation include average surface slope, glacier order (analogous to stream order), and the ratio of upper accumulation area to lower ablation area width, all of which are positively related to glacier relief. We note strong relations between glacier relief and climate in all mountain regions of British Columbia, with glaciers of the interior ranges being most sensitive to spatial climatic variability. We show how our approach can be used to estimate past climatic conditions based on historical ice extents, such as at the 'Little Ice Age' maximum, and to predict potential future equilibrium glacier extents in a changed climate regime, such as those predicted by general and regional circulation models."
distribution of american pikas in a low-elevation lava landscape: conservation implications from the range periphery,"Predicting species distributions is increasingly important in conservation biology and, in the context of contemporary climate change, can be particularly informative for populations at the periphery of the range. Peripheral populations can exhibit unique patterns of habitat use in response to marginal conditions and can provide colonists adapted to novel or extreme environments. We conducted surveys for American pikas (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Ochotona princeps</i>) during 2007-2009 in 144 sites in Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve, Idaho. This species appears vulnerable to global climate change, and Craters of the Moon is an extensive area of low-elevation lava habitat situated on an interior edge of the species' range. We found pikas to be readily detectable when both direct and indirect sign were used. An estimate of detection probability from a subset of 72 sites that were visited twice was 0.92. We detected pikas in 31% of survey sites overall but only at sites above 1,605 m. We used logistic regression to model the distribution of pikas as a function of elevation, substrate, and vegetation cover. Pikas were most likely to occur on structurally complex pahoehoe lava flows above 1,600 m. The odds of pika occurrence on pahoehoe lava was &gt;10 times that of aa lava flows and increased by 2 times for each <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">SD</i> increase in elevation. Pikas were also more likely to occur on lava flow sites with higher structural complexity and forb cover. An area of pahoehoe lava encompassing &gt;250 km<sup xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">2</sup> in the northern portion of Craters of the Moon contained 91% of pika detections and all predicted site-occurrence probabilities &gt;0.38, an optimal cutoff value determined by examining model receiver operating characteristic curves. Craters of the Moon may provide long-term refugia for the species, given the extent of lava habitat there. However, the importance of elevation in our models suggests that accelerated climate change could erode suitable pika habitat in the park. Most research on pikas has relied on censuses or nonrandom convenience surveys, but we demonstrate an efficient probabilistic sampling approach that has broad application for pika monitoring and research."
ecological impacts and management strategies for western larch in the face of climate-change,"Approximately 185,000 forest inventory and ecological plots from both USA and Canada were used to predict the contemporary distribution of western larch (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Larix occidentalis</i> Nutt.) from climate variables. The random forests algorithm, using an 8-variable model, produced an overall error rate of about 2.9%, nearly all of which consisted of predicting presence at locations where the species was absent. Genetic variation among 143 populations within western larch's natural distribution was predicted from multiple regression models using variables describing the climate of the seed source as predictors and response data from two separate genetic tests: (1) 15-year height at a field site in British Columbia, Canada, and, (2) two principal components of 8 variables describing growth, disease tolerance, and phenology of 6-year-old trees in a test in Idaho, USA. Presence and absence of the species and genetic variation within the species were projected into future climates provided by three General Circulation Models and two scenarios. Although the projections described pronounced impacts on the species and its populations, concurrence among the six projections pinpointed areas where the probability would be high that the future climate would be suitable for western larch. Concurrence among projections also was used to locate those sources of seed that should be best attuned genetically to future climates. The procedures outline a logical approach for developing management strategies for accommodating climate-change while taking into account the variability imposed by the differences among climatic estimates."
"relating climatic attributes and water resources allocation: a study using surface water supply and soil moisture indices in the snake river basin, idaho","Climate change forced by anthropogenic activities has been ongoing since at least the beginning of the industrial revolution. Part of the recent warming in the western United States has been attributed to anthropogenic climate change. This research seeks to answer the basic question of how declining streamflow, increasing temperatures, and fluctuation in precipitation have impacted water resource allocation in the Snake River Plain over the past 35 years (1971-2005). Understanding how changes in climatic attributes have historically impacted water allocation should help water managers better understand how projected climate change may influence allocation. Annual and monthly diversion trends from 62 locations in the Snake River Plain were compared to temperature and precipitation trends at 10 climate stations across the basin. We found a strong trend of declining annual surface water diversions across the study area. Of the 62 diversion points examined, 45 have highly significant decreasing annual diversion trends, while an additional 8 have significant decreasing trends. Despite the annual decline in surface water diversions, April diversions have increased at more than half of the diversion points, with 15 locations showing highly significant trends and an additional 17 showing significant increasing diversion trends. A comparison of diversions to the Surface Water Supply Index indicates that the decline in midseason and late season diversions is mostly caused by decreasing supply in the study period, while a comparison of diversions to Palmer's <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Z</i> index and the Standardized Precipitation Index indicates that early season diversions are highly correlated to early season moisture anomalies."
the effects of climate change and extreme wildfire events on runoff erosion over a mountain watershed,"Increases in wildfire occurrence and severity under an altered climate can substantially impact terrestrial ecosystems through enhancing runoff erosion. Improved prediction tools that provide high resolution spatial information are necessary for location-specific soil conservation and watershed management. However, quantifying the magnitude of soil erosion and its interactions with climate, hydrological processes, and fire occurrences across a large region (>10,000 km(2)) is challenging because of the large computational requirements needed to capture the fine-scale complexities of the land surface that govern erosion. We apply the physically-based coupled Variable Capacity Infiltration-Water Erosion Prediction Project (VIC-WEPP) model to study how wildfire occurrences can enhance soil erosion in a future climate over a representative watershed in the northern Rocky Mountains - the Salmon River Basin (SRB) in central Idaho. While the VIC model simulates hydrologic processes at larger scales, the WEPP model simulates erosion at the hillslope scale by sampling representative hillslopes. VIC-WEPP model results indicate that SRB streamflow will have an earlier shift in peak flow by one to two months under future climate scenarios in response to a declining snowpack under warming temperatures. The magnitude of peak flow increases with each higher severity fire scenario; and under the highest fire severity, the peak flow is shifted even earlier, exacerbating the effects of climate change. Similarly, sediment yield also increases with higher fire severities for both historical and future climates. Sediment yield is more sensitive to fire occurrence than to climate change by one to two orders of magnitude, which is not unexpected given that our fire scenarios were applied basin wide as worst case scenarios. In reality, fires only occur over portions of the basin in any given year and subsequent years' vegetation regrowth reduces erosion. However, the effects of climate change on sediment yield result in greater spatial heterogeneities, primarily because of the spatial differences in precipitation projections, while fire conditions were uniformly applied. The combined effects of climate change and a possible continuation of increasing fire frequency and severity will compound excess sediment issues that already exist in this region of the intermountain West.

"climate change predicted to shift wolverine distributions, connectivity, and dispersal corridors","Boreal species sensitive to the timing and duration of snow cover are particularly vulnerable to global climate change. Recent work has shown a link between wolverine (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Gulo gulo</i>) habitat and persistent spring snow cover through 15 May, the approximate end of the wolverine's reproductive denning period. We modeled the distribution of snow cover within the Columbia, Upper Missouri, and Upper Colorado River Basins using a downscaled ensemble climate model. The ensemble model was based on the arithmetic mean of 10 global climate models (GCMs) that best fit historical climate trends and patterns within these three basins. Snow cover was estimated from resulting downscaled temperature and precipitation patterns using a hydrologic model. We bracketed our ensemble model predictions by analyzing warm (miroc 3.2) and cool (pcm1) downscaled GCMs. Because Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-based snow cover relationships were analyzed at much finer grain than downscaled GCM output, we conducted a second analysis based on MODIS-based snow cover that persisted through 29 May, simulating the onset of spring two weeks earlier in the year. Based on the downscaled ensemble model, 67% of predicted spring snow cover will persist within the study area through 2030-2059, and 37% through 2070-2099. Estimated snow cover for the ensemble model during the period 2070-2099 was similar to persistent MODIS snow cover through 29 May. Losses in snow cover were greatest at the southern periphery of the study area (Oregon, Utah, and New Mexico, USA) and least in British Columbia, Canada. Contiguous areas of spring snow cover become smaller and more isolated over time, but large (&gt;1000 km<sup xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">2</sup>) contiguous areas of wolverine habitat are predicted to persist within the study area throughout the 21st century for all projections. Areas that retain snow cover throughout the 21st century are British Columbia, north-central Washington, northwestern Montana, and the Greater Yellowstone Area. By the late 21st century, dispersal modeling indicates that habitat isolation at or above levels associated with genetic isolation of wolverine populations becomes widespread. Overall, we expect wolverine habitat to persist throughout the species range at least for the first half of the 21st century, but populations will likely become smaller and more isolated."
system dynamics to sustainable water resources management in the eastern snake plain aquifer under water supply uncertainty,"Water supply uncertainty continues to threaten the reliability of regional water resources in the western United States. Climate variability and water dispute potentials induce water managers to develop proactive adaptive management strategies to mitigate future hydroclimate impacts. The Eastern Snake Plain Aquifer in the state of Idaho is also facing these challenges in the sense that population growth and economic development strongly depend on reliable water resources from underground storage. Drought and subsequent water conflict often drive scientific research and political agendas because water resources availability and aquifer management for a sustainable rural economy are of great interest. In this study, a system dynamics approach is applied to address dynamically complex problems with management of the aquifer and associated surface-water and groundwater interactions. Recharge and discharge dynamics within the aquifer system are coded in an environmental modeling framework to identify long-term behavior of aquifer responses to uncertain future hydrological variability. The research shows that the system dynamics approach is a promising modeling tool to develop sustainable water resources planning and management in a collaborative decision-making framework and also to provide useful insights and alternative opportunities for operational management, policy support, and participatory strategic planning to mitigate future hydroclimate impacts in human dimensions."
impacts of climate change on hydrology and water resources in the boise and spokane river basins,"In the Pacific Northwest, warming climate has resulted in a lengthened growing season, declining snowpack, and earlier timing of spring runoff. This study characterizes the impact of climate change in two basins in Idaho, the Spokane River and the Boise River basins. We simulated the basin-scale hydrology by coupling the downscaled precipitation and temperature outputs from a suite of global climate models and the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), between 2010 and 2060 and assess the impacts of climate change on water resources in the region. For the Boise River basin, changes in precipitation ranged from -3.8 to 36%. Changes in temperature were expected to be between 0.02 and 3.9������C. In the Spokane River region, changes in precipitation were expected to be between -6.7 and 17.9%. Changes in temperature appeared between 0.1 and 3.5������C over a period of the next five decades between 2010 and 2060. Without bias-correcting the simulated streamflow, in the Boise River basin, change in peak flows (March through June) was projected to range from -58 to +106 m<sup xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">3</sup>/s and, for the Spokane River basin, the range was expected to be from -198 to +88 m<sup xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">3</sup>/s. Both the basins exhibited substantial variability in precipitation, evapotranspiration, and recharge estimates, and this knowledge of possible hydrologic impacts at the watershed scale can help the stakeholders with possible options in their decision-making process."
"quantifying the contribution of glacier runoff to streamflow in the upper columbia river basin, canada","Glacier melt provides important contributions to streamflow in many mountainous regions. Hydrologic model calibration in glacier-fed catchments is difficult because errors in modelling snow accumulation can be offset by compensating errors in glacier melt. This problem is particularly severe in catchments with modest glacier cover, where goodness-of-fit statistics such as the Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency may not be highly sensitive to the streamflow variance associated with glacier melt. While glacier mass balance measurements can be used to aid model calibration, they are absent for most catchments. We introduce the use of glacier volume change determined from repeated glacier mapping in a guided GLUE (generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation) procedure to calibrate a hydrologic model. This approach is applied to the Mica basin in the Canadian portion of the Columbia River Basin using the HBV-EC hydrologic model. Use of glacier volume change in the calibration procedure effectively reduced parameter uncertainty and helped to ensure that the model was accurately predicting glacier mass balance as well as streamflow. The seasonal and interannual variations in glacier melt contributions were assessed by running the calibrated model with historic glacier cover and also after converting all glacierized areas to alpine land cover in the model setup. Sensitivity of modelled streamflow to historic changes in glacier cover and to projected glacier changes for a climate warming scenario was assessed by comparing simulations using static glacier cover to simulations that accommodated dynamic changes in glacier area. Although glaciers in the Mica basin only cover 5% of the watershed, glacier ice melt contributes up to 25% and 35% of streamflow in August and September, respectively. The mean annual contribution of ice melt to total streamflow varied between 3 and 9% and averaged 6%. Glacier ice melt is particularly important during warm, dry summers following winters with low snow accumulation and early snowpack depletion. Although the sensitivity of streamflow to historic glacier area changes is small and within parameter uncertainties, our results suggest that glacier area changes have to be accounted for in future projections of late summer streamflow. Our approach provides an effective and widely applicable method to calibrate hydrologic models in glacier fed catchments, as well as to quantify the magnitude and timing of glacier melt contributions to streamflow."
"effects of ecohydrological variables on current and future ranges, local suitability patterns, and model accuracy in big sagebrush","Forecasting of species and ecosystem responses to novel conditions, including climate change, is one of the major challenges facing ecologists at the start of the 21st century. Climate change studies based on species distribution models (SDMs) have been criticized because they extend correlational relationships beyond the observed data. Here, we compared conventional climate-based SDMs against ecohydrological SDMs that include information from process-based simulations of water balance. We examined the current and future distribution of <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Artemisia tridentata</i> (big sagebrush) representing sagebrush ecosystems, which are widespread in semiarid western North America. For each approach, we calculated ensemble models from nine SDM methods and tested accuracy of each SDM with a null distribution. Climatic conditions included current conditions for 1970-1999 and two IPCC projections B1 and A2 for 2070-2099. Ecohydrological conditions were assessed by simulating soil water balance with SOILWAT, a daily time-step, multiple layer, mechanistic, soil water model. Under current conditions, both climatic and ecohydrological SDM approaches produced comparable sagebrush distributions. Overall, sagebrush distribution is forecasted to decrease, with larger decreases under the A2 than under the B1 scenario and strong decreases in the southern part of the range. Increases were forecasted in the northern parts and at higher elevations. Both SDM approaches produced accurate predictions. However, the ecohydrological SDM approach was slightly less accurate than climatic SDMs (-1% in AUC, -4% in Kappa and TSS) and predicted a higher number of habitat patches than observed in the input data. Future predictions of ecohydrological SDMs included an increased number of habitat patches whereas climatic SDMs predicted a decrease. This difference is important for understanding landscape-scale patterns of sagebrush ecosystems and management of sagebrush obligate species for future conditions. Several mechanisms can explain the diverging forecasts; however, we need better insights into the consequences of different datasets for SDMs and how these affect our understanding of future trajectories."
enso anomalies over the western united states: present and future patterns in regional climate simulations,"Surface temperature, precipitation, specific humidity and wind anomalies associated with the warm and cold phases of ENSO simulated by WRF and HadRM are examined for the present and future decades. WRF is driven by ECHAM5 and CCSM3, respectively, and HadRM is driven by HadCM3. For the current decades, all simulations show some capability in resolving the observed warm-dry and cool-wet teleconnection patterns over the PNW and the Southwest U.S. for warm and cold ENSO. Differences in the regional simulations originate primarily from the respective driving fields. For the future decades, the warm-dry and cool-wet teleconnection patterns in association with ENSO are still represented in ECHAM5-WRF and HadRM. However, there are indications of changes in the ENSO teleconnection patterns for CCSM3-WRF in the future, with wet anomalies dominating in the PNW and the Southwest U.S. for both warm and cold ENSO, in contrast to the canonical patterns of precipitation anomalies. Interaction of anomalous wind flow with local terrain plays a critical role in the generation of anomalous precipitation over the western U.S. Anomalous dry conditions are always associated with anomalous airflow that runs parallel to local mountains and wet conditions with airflow that runs perpendicular to local mountains. Future changes in temperature and precipitation associated with the ENSO events in the regional simulations indicate varying responses depending on the variables examined as well as depending on the phase of ENSO."
the adaptation for conservation targets (act) framework: a tool for incorporating climate change into natural resource management,"As natural resource management agencies and conservation organizations seek guidance on responding to climate change, myriad potential actions and strategies have been proposed for increasing the long-term viability of some attributes of natural systems. Managers need practical tools for selecting among these actions and strategies to develop a tailored management approach for specific targets at a given location. We developed and present one such tool, the participatory Adaptation for Conservation Targets (ACT) framework, which considers the effects of climate change in the development of management actions for particular species, ecosystems and ecological functions. Our framework is based on the premise that effective adaptation of management to climate change can rely on local knowledge of an ecosystem and does not necessarily require detailed projections of climate change or its effects. We illustrate the ACT framework by applying it to an ecological function in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (Montana, Wyoming, and Idaho, USA)-water flows in the upper Yellowstone River. We suggest that the ACT framework is a practical tool for initiating adaptation planning, and for generating and communicating specific management interventions given an increasingly altered, yet uncertain, climate."
"climate and glacier mass balance trends from ad 1780 to present in the columbia mountains, british columbia, canada","Climate and glacier mass balance trends from 1780 to present within the Columbia Mountains, British Columbia, Canada, were investigated using tree-ring data. Annually resolved ring width, maximum density and maximum cell wall thickness chronologies were constructed from increment core samples of Engelmann spruce (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Picea engelmannii</i>), mountain hemlock (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Tsuga mertensiana</i>) and subalpine fir (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Abies lasiocarpa</i>) trees collected in Glacier and Revelstoke national parks. Proxy records of maximum June-August temperature, August precipitation and February snowpack provide insight into long-term seasonal climate changes. The intervals 1790-1810, 1850-1870 and 1930-1950 were characterized by warm summer temperatures. While overall August precipitation totals decrease over the period of record, the late 1700s, 1805-1835, the 1880s, 1960-1975 and the mid 1980s were notably wetter. February snowpacks have generally decreased in depth since 1873. The reconstructed winter, summer and net mass balance records indicate that glacier cover in the Columbia Mountains has varied primarily in response to decreased snowfall since the mid 1700s. Intervals of terminus advance and retreat were shown to reflect glaciological responses to relatively short-duration variations in summer temperature and winter snowfall. The rate of cumulative mass balance decline within the last 30 years exceeds that observed at any time over the last 250 years."
coupling snowpack and groundwater dynamics to interpret historical streamflow trends in the western united states,"A key challenge for resource and land managers is predicting the consequences of climate warming on streamflow and water resources. During the last century in the western United States, significant reductions in snowpack and earlier snowmelt have led to an increase in the fraction of annual streamflow during winter and a decline in the summer. Previous work has identified elevation as it relates to snowpack dynamics as the primary control on streamflow sensitivity to warming. But along with changes in the timing of snowpack accumulation and melt, summer streamflows are also sensitive to intrinsic, geologically mediated differences in the efficiency of landscapes in transforming recharge (either as rain or snow) into discharge; we term this latter factor drainage efficiency. Here we explore the conjunction of drainage efficiency and snowpack dynamics in interpreting retrospective trends in summer streamflow during 1950-2010 using daily streamflow from 81 watersheds across the western United States. The recession constant (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">k</i>) and fraction of precipitation falling as snow (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">S</i><sub xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">f</sub>) were used as metrics of deep groundwater and overall precipitation regime (rain and/or snow), respectively. This conjunctive analysis indicates that summer streamflows in watersheds that drain slowly from deep groundwater and receive precipitation as snow are most sensitive to climate warming. During the spring, however, watersheds that drain rapidly and receive precipitation as snow are most sensitive to climate warming. Our results indicate that not all trends in western United States are associated with changes in snowpack dynamics; we observe declining streamflow in late fall and winter in rain-dominated watersheds as well. These empirical findings support both theory and hydrologic modelling and have implications for how streamflow sensitivity to warming is interpreted across broad regions."
a system dynamics model for conjunctive management of water resources in the snake river basin,"The Pacific Northwest is expected to witness changes in temperature and precipitation due to climate change. In this study, we enhance the Snake River Planning Model (SRPM) by modeling the feedback loop between incidental recharge and surface water supply resulting from surface water and groundwater extraction for irrigation and provide a case study involving climate change impacts and management scenarios. The new System Dynamics-Snake River Planning Model (SD-SRPM) is calibrated to flow at Box Canyon Springs located along a major outlet of the East Snake Plain Aquifer. A calibration of the model to flow at Box Canyon Springs, based on historic diversions (1950-1995) resulted in an <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">r</i><sup xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">2</sup> value of 0.74 and a validation (1996-2005) <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">r</i><sup xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">2</sup> value of 0.60.

The scenarios that compared the impacts of climate change were based on ensemble mean precipitation change scenarios and estimated changes to crop evapotranspiration (ET). Increased ET, despite increased precipitation, generally increased surface water shortages and discharge of springs. This study highlights the need to develop and implement models that integrate the human-natural system to understand the impacts of climate change."
higher temperatures enhance the effects of invasive sportfish on mountain zooplankton communities,"Decades of introductions of exotic sportfish to mountain lakes around the world have impoverished them biologically, and this may be exacerbated by global warming. We assessed the current status of invasive salmonids and native zooplankton communities in 34 naturally fishless lakes along an elevational gradient, which served as an environmental proxy for the expected effects of climate change. Our main goal was to explore how climate-related variables influence the effects of stocked salmonids on the total biomass, species richness and taxonomic composition of zooplankton. We predicted that warmer conditions would dampen the negative predatory effects of exotic brook trout (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Salvelinus fontinalis</i>) on zooplankton communities because more temperate lakes contain a greater diversity of potentially tolerant species. Instead, we discovered that the persistence of stocked brook trout in the warmer lakes significantly amplified total zooplankton biomass and species richness. In colder and deeper lakes, zooplankton were relatively unaffected by <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">S. fontinalis</i>, which however persisted better in alpine lakes than at lower elevations after stocking practices were halted over two decades ago. Warmer lake conditions and higher concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were significant primary drivers of zooplankton species turnover, both favouring greater species diversity. Our findings of an ecological surprise involving potential synergistic positive effects of climate warming and exotic trout on native zooplankton communities presents a conundrum for managers of certain national mountain parks. Present mandates to eradicate non-native trout and return the mountain lakes to their naturally fishless state may conflict with efforts to conserve biodiversity under a rapidly changing climate."
interactive effects of water diversion and climate change for juvenile chinook salmon in the lemhi river basin (us.a.).,"The combined effects of water diversion and climate change are a major conservation challenge for freshwater ecosystems. In the Lemhi Basin, Idaho (U.S.A.), water diversion causes changes in streamflow, and climate change will further affect streamflow and temperature. Shifts in streamflow and temperature regimes can affect juvenile salmon growth, movement, and survival. We examined the potential effects of water diversion and climate change on juvenile Chinook salmon (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Oncorhynchus tshawytscha</i>), a species listed as threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA). To examine the effects for juvenile survival, we created a model relating 19 years of juvenile survival data to streamflow and temperature and found spring streamflow and summer temperature were good predictors of juvenile survival. We used these models to project juvenile survival for 15 diversion and climate-change scenarios. Projected survival was 42-58% lower when streamflows were diverted than when streamflows were undiverted. For diverted streamflows, 2040 climate-change scenarios (ECHO-G and CGCM3.1 T47) resulted in an additional 11-39% decrease in survival. We also created models relating habitat carrying capacity to streamflow and made projections for diversion and climate-change scenarios. Habitat carrying capacity estimated for diverted streamflows was 17-58% lower than for undiverted streamflows. Climate-change scenarios resulted in additional decreases in carrying capacity for the dry (ECHO-G) climate model. Our results indicate climate change will likely pose an additional stressor that should be considered when evaluating the effects of anthropogenic actions on salmon population status. Thus, this type of analysis will be especially important for evaluating effects of specific actions on a particular species."
woodland dynamics at the northern range periphery: a challenge for protected area management in a changing world,"Managers of protected natural areas increasingly are confronted with novel ecological conditions and conflicting objectives to preserve the past while fostering resilience for an uncertain future. This dilemma may be pronounced at range peripheries where rates of change are accelerated and ongoing invasions often are perceived as threats to local ecosystems. We provide an example from City of Rocks National Reserve (CIRO) in southern Idaho, positioned at the northern range periphery of pinyon-juniper (P-J) woodland. Reserve managers are concerned about P-J woodland encroachment into adjacent sagebrush steppe, but the rates and biophysical variability of encroachment are not well documented and management options are not well understood. We quantified the rate and extent of woodland change between 1950 and 2009 based on a random sample of aerial photo interpretation plots distributed across biophysical gradients. Our study revealed that woodland cover remained at approximately 20% of the study area over the 59-year period. In the absence of disturbance, P-J woodlands exhibited the highest rate of increase among vegetation types at 0.37% yr<sup xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">-1</sup>. Overall, late-successional P-J stands increased in area by over 100% through the process of densification (infilling). However, wildfires during the period resulted in a net decrease of woody evergreen vegetation, particularly among early and mid-successional P-J stands. Elevated wildfire risk associated with expanding novel annual grasslands and drought is likely to continue to be a fundamental driver of change in CIRO woodlands. Because P-J woodlands contribute to regional biodiversity and may contract at trailing edges with global warming, CIRO may become important to P-J woodland conservation in the future. Our study provides a widely applicable toolset for assessing woodland ecotone dynamics that can help managers reconcile the competing demands to maintain historical fidelity and contribute meaningfully to the U.S. protected area network in a future with novel, no-analog ecosystems."
climate-induced shift in hydrological regime alters basal resource dynamics in a wilderness river ecosystem,"We integrated a 20-year ecological data set from a sparsely inhabited, snowmelt-dominated catchment with hydrologic models to predict the effects of hydrologic shifts on stream biofilm. We used a stepwise multiple regression to assess the relationship between hydrology and biofilm ash-free dry mass (AFDM) and chlorophyll-<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">a</i> (chl-<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">a</i>) under recent climate conditions. Biofilm AFDM was significantly related to the timing of peak streamflow, and chl-<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">a</i> was significantly related to the timing of median streamflow. We applied these results to output from the variable infiltration capacity hydrologic model, which predicted hydrology under a baseline scenario (+0������C) and a range of warming scenarios expected with climate change (+1, +2 or +3������C). When compared to the baseline, the results indicated that earlier peakflows predicted under warming scenarios may lead to earlier initiation of biofilm growth. This may increase biofilm AFDM during the summer by up to 103% (������29) in the +3������C scenario. Moreover, interannual variability of AFDM was predicted to increase up to 300%. Average chl-<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">a</i> during the summer increased by up to 90% (������15) in the +3������C scenario; however, its response was not significantly different from baseline in most years. Because hydrologic change may alter the temporal dynamics of biofilm growth, it may affect the seasonal dynamics of biofilm quality (i.e. chl-<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">a</i>-to-AFDM ratio). The results indicated that hydrologic shifts may increase biofilm quality during the spring, but may decrease it during the summer. Thus, we provide evidence that predicted hydrologic shifts in snowmelt-dominated streams may alter the quantity and quality of an important basal resource. However, the magnitudes of these predictions are likely to be affected by other environmental changes that are occurring with climate change (e.g. increased wildfire activity and stream warming)."
climate change impacts on maritime mountain snowpack in the oregon cascades,"This study investigates the effect of projected temperature increases on maritime mountain snowpack in the McKenzie River Basin (MRB; 3041 km<sup xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">2</sup>) in the Cascades Mountains of Oregon, USA. We simulated the spatial distribution of snow water equivalent (SWE) in the MRB for the period of 1989-2009 with SnowModel, a spatially-distributed, process-based model (Liston and Elder, 2006b). Simulations were evaluated using point-based measurements of SWE, precipitation, and temperature that showed Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency coefficients of 0.83, 0.97, and 0.80, respectively. Spatial accuracy was shown to be 82% using snow cover extent from the Landsat Thematic Mapper. The validated model then evaluated the inter- and intra-year sensitivity of basin wide snowpack to projected temperature increases (2������C) and variability in precipitation (������10%). Results show that a 2������C increase in temperature would shift the average date of peak snowpack 12 days earlier and decrease basin-wide volumetric snow water storage by 56%. Snowpack between the elevations of 1000 and 2000 m is the most sensitive to increases in temperature. Upper elevations were also affected, but to a lesser degree. Temperature increases are the primary driver of diminished snowpack accumulation, however variability in precipitation produce discernible changes in the timing and volumetric storage of snowpack. The results of this study are regionally relevant as melt water from the MRB's snowpack provides critical water supply for agriculture, ecosystems, and municipalities throughout the region especially in summer when water demand is high. While this research focused on one watershed, it serves as a case study examining the effects of climate change on maritime snow, which comprises 10% of the Earth's seasonal snow cover."
an innovative aerial assessment of greater yellowstone ecosystem mountain pine beetle-caused whitebark pine mortality,"An innovative aerial survey method called the Landscape Assessment System (LAS) was used to assess mountain pine beetle (MPB; <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Dendroctonus ponderosae</i>)-caused mortality of whitebark pine (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Pinus albicaulis</i>) across the species distribution in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE; 894774 ha). This large-scale implementation of the LAS method consisted of 8673 km of flight lines, along which 4653 geo-tagged, oblique aerial photos were captured at the catchment level (a subset of 12-digit USGS hydrologic units) and geographic information system (GIS) processed. The Mountain Pine Beetle-caused Mortality Rating System, a landscape-scale classification system designed specifically to measure the cumulative effects of recent and older MPB attacks on whitebark pine, was used to classify mortality with a rating from 0 to 6 based on the amount of red (recent attack) and gray (old attack) trees visible. The approach achieved a photo inventory of 79% of the GYE whitebark pine distribution. For the remaining 21%, mortality levels were estimated based on an interpolated surface. Results that combine the photo-inventoried and interpolated mortality indicate that nearly half (46%) of the GYE whitebark pine distribution showed severe mortality (3-4 or 5.3-5.4 rating), 36% showed moderate mortality (2-2.9 rating), 13% showed low mortality (1-1.9 rating), and 5% showed trace levels of mortality (0-0.9). These results reveal that the proliferation of MPB in the subalpine zone of the GYE due to climate warming has led to whitebark pine mortality that is more severe and widespread than indicated from either previous modeling research or USDA Forest Service Aerial Detection surveys. Sixteen of the 22 major mountain ranges of the GYE have experienced widespread moderate-to-severe mortality. The majority of catchments in the other six mountain ranges show low-to-moderate mortality. Refugia from MPB outbreaks, at least for now, also exist and correspond to locations that have colder microclimates. The spatially explicit mortality information produced by this project has helped forest managers develop and implement conservation strategies that include both preservation and restoration efforts. Future research aimed at documenting and quantifying the ecological impacts of widespread decline and collapse of this foundation and keystone species is warranted."
snowpack regimes of the western united states,"Snow accumulation and melt patterns play a significant role in the water, energy, carbon, and nutrient cycles in the montane environments of the Western United States. Recent studies have illustrated that changes in the snow/rainfall apportionments and snow accumulation and melt patterns may occur as a consequence of changes in climate in the region. In order to understand how these changes may affect the snow regimes of the region, the current characteristics of the snow accumulation and melt patterns must be identified. Here we characterize the snow water equivalent (SWE) curve formed by the daily SWE values at 766 snow pillow stations in the Western United States, focusing on several metrics of the yearly SWE curves and the relationships between the different metrics. The metrics are the initial snow accumulation and snow disappearance dates, the peak snow accumulation and date of peak, the length of the snow accumulation season, the length of the snowmelt season, and the snow accumulation and snowmelt slopes. Three snow regimes emerge from these results: a maritime, an intermountain, and a continental regime. The maritime regime is characterized by higher maximum snow accumulations reaching 300 cm and shorter accumulation periods of less than 220 days. Conversely, the continental regime is characterized by lower maximum accumulations below 200 cm and longer accumulation periods reaching over 260 days. The intermountain regime lies in between. The regions that show the characteristics of the maritime regime include the Cascade Mountains, the Klamath Mountains, and the Sierra Nevada Mountains. The intermountain regime includes the Eastern Cascades slopes and foothills, the Blue Mountains, Northern and Central basins and ranges, the Columbia Mountains/Northern Rockies, the Idaho Batholith, and the Canadian Rockies. Lastly, the continental regime includes the Middle and Southern Rockies, and the Wasatch and Uinta Mountains. The implications of snow regime classification are discussed in the context of possible changes in accumulation and melt patterns associated with regional warming."
testing the recent snow drought as an analog for climate warming sensitivity of cascades snowpacks,"Record low snowpack conditions were observed at Snow Telemetry stations in the Cascades Mountains, USA during the winters of 2014 and 2015. We tested the hypothesis that these winters are analogs for the temperature sensitivity of Cascades snowpacks. In the Oregon Cascades, the 2014 and 2015 winter air temperature anomalies were approximately +2 degrees C and +4 degrees C above the climatological mean. We used a spatially distributed snowpack energy balance model to simulate the sensitivity of multiple snowpack metrics to a +2 degrees C and +4 degrees C warming and compared our modeled sensitivities to observed values during 2014 and 2015. Wefound that for each +1 degrees C warming, modeled basin-mean peak snow water equivalent (SWE) declined by 22%-30%, the date of peak SWE (DPS) advanced by 13 days, the duration of snow cover (DSC) shortened by 31-34 days, and the snow disappearance date (SDD) advanced by 22-25 days. Our hypothesis was not borne out by the observations except in the case of peak SWE; other snow metrics did not resemble predicted values based on modeled sensitivities and thus are not effective analogs of future temperature sensitivities. Rather than just temperature, it appears that the magnitude and phasing of winter precipitation events, such as large, late spring snowfall, controlled the DPS, SDD, and DSC."
regional projections of the likelihood of very large wildland fires under a changing climate in the contiguous western united states,"Seasonal changes in the climatic potential for very large wildfires (VLWF���������50,000 ac���������20,234 ha) across the western contiguous United States are projected over the 21st century using generalized linear models and downscaled climate projections for two representative concentration pathways (RCPs). Significant (p���������0.05) increases in VLWF probability for climate of the mid-21st century (2031-2060) relative to contemporary climate are found, for both RCP 4.5 and 8.5. The largest differences are in the Eastern Great Basin, Northern Rockies, Pacific Northwest, Rocky Mountains, and Southwest. Changes in seasonality and frequency of VLWFs depend on changes in the future climate space. For example, flammability-limited areas such as the Pacific Northwest show that (with high model agreement) the frequency of weeks with VLWFs in a given year is 2-2.7 more likely. However, frequency of weeks with at least one VLWF in fuel-limited systems like the Western Great Basin is 1.3 times more likely (with low model agreement). Thus, areas where fire is directly associated with hot and dry climate, as opposed to experiencing lagged effects from previous years, experience more change in the likelihood of VLWF in future projections. The results provide a quantitative foundation for management to mitigate the effects of VLWFs."
drought-triggered western spruce budworm outbreaks in the interior pacific northwest: a multi-century dendrochronological record,"Douglas-fir forests in the interior Pacific Northwest are subject to sporadic outbreaks of the western spruce budworm, a species widely recognized as the most destructive defoliator in western North America. Outbreaks of the western spruce budworm often occur synchronously over broad regions and lead to widespread loss of leaf area and decrease in growth rates in affected stands. In spite of the ecological and economic significance of this defoliator, the mechanisms controlling this species' population dynamics are still not fully understood. We used dendrochronological methods to reconstruct three centuries of western spruce budworm outbreaks at thirteen sites along a transect running from central Oregon to western Montana and compared the outbreak reconstructions with regional drought history. The reconstructions reveal repeated western spruce budworm outbreaks that sometimes persisted more than a decade and were significantly synchronous among sites. Synchrony was higher in the second half of the record, possibly due to changes in forest composition and structure brought about by land use practices. Across stands and regions, there was a moderately strong relationship between initiation of synchronous outbreaks and periods of transitional climate conditions in which moisture availability was below average prior to outbreak initiation, but above average in the first few years of an outbreak. There was a weak relationship between cessation of outbreaks and one or more years of high moisture availability. Outbreaks tended to occur near the end of droughts. The association between climatic variability and outbreak dynamics observed across this transect indicates that climate is an important driver of western spruce budworm outbreaks. Other factors that we did not test, but that may influence outbreak dynamics include stand structure, forest composition, predation, and phenological synchrony between larvae and host trees. Future changes in western spruce budworm outbreak dynamics will be determined by a combination of changing climate, interactions with other disturbance agents, and changing forest composition and structure. Our results suggest that western spruce budworm outbreaks will likely intensify if drought frequency increases in the future."
a simple framework for assessing the sensitivity of mountain watersheds to warming-driven snowpack loss,"The common observation that snowpack increases with elevation suggests that a catchment's elevation distribution should be a robust indicator of its potential to store snow and its sensitivity to snowpack loss. To capture a wide range of potential elevation-based responses, we used Monte Carlo methods to simulate 20,000 watershed elevation distributions. We applied a simple function relating warming, elevation, and snowpack to explore snowpack losses from the simulated elevation distributions. Regression analyses demonstrate that snowpack loss is best described by three parameters that identify the central tendency, variance, and shape of each catchment's elevation distribution. Equal amounts of snowpack loss can occur even when catchments are centered within different elevation zones; this stresses the value of also measuring the variance and shape of elevation distributions. Responses of the simulated elevation distributions to warming are nonlinear and emphasize that the sensitivity of mountain forests to snowpack loss will likely be watershed dependent."
area burned in the western united states is unaffected by recent mountain pine beetle outbreaks,"In the western United States, mountain pine beetles (MPBs) have killed pine trees across 71,000 km<sup xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">2</sup> of forest since the mid-1990s, leading to widespread concern that abundant dead fuels may increase area burned and exacerbate fire behavior. Although stand-level fire behavior models suggest that bark beetle-induced tree mortality increases flammability of stands by changing canopy and forest floor fuels, the actual effect of an MPB outbreak on subsequent wildfire activity remains widely debated. To address this knowledge gap, we superimposed areas burned on areas infested by MPBs for the three peak years of wildfire activity since 2002 across the western United States. Here, we show that the observed effect of MPB infestation on the area burned in years of extreme fire appears negligible at broad spatial extents. Contrary to the expectation of increased wildfire activity in recently infested red-stage stands, we found no difference between observed area and expected area burned in red-stage or subsequent gray-stage stands during three peak years of wildfire activity, which account for 46% of area burned during the 2002-2013 period. Although MPB infestation and fire activity both independently increased in conjunction with recent warming, our results demonstrate that the annual area burned in the western United States has not increased in direct response to bark beetle activity. Therefore, policy discussions should focus on societal adaptation to the effects of recent increases in wildfire activity related to increased drought severity."
which tree species and biome types are most vulnerable to climate change in the us northern rocky mountains?,"The goal of this study was to assess components of vulnerability of tree species and biome types to projected future climate within the Great Northern Landscape Conservation Cooperative (GNLCC) in the US Northern Rockies and the ecosystems surrounding Glacier and Yellowstone/Grand Teton National Parks. We drew on the results of five published studies and analyzed current and projected future climate suitability for 11 tree species and 8 biome types under two IPCC emissions scenarios. We assessed components of vulnerability based on four metrics of current and projected future climate suitability. Results for biome types indicated largely a shift from climates suitable for alpine and subalpine conifer to climates suitable for desert scrub and grassland types. Results from the four studies of tree species indicated substantial loss of area of climate suitability for the four subalpine species by 2100. This was especially true for Whitebark pine (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Pinus albicaulis</i>). Suitable climate for this species dropped from just over 20% of the study area in the reference period to 0.5-7.0% by 2070-2100 under the A2 scenario. The studies agreed in projecting expansion of climate suitability for some montane tree species but disagreed on expansion of climate suitability of west-side mesic tree species to eastside locations such as Yellowstone National park. Importantly, the rankings of tree species vulnerability were similar among studies, scenarios, and geographic areas and indicated highest vulnerability for Whitebark pine and Mountain hemlock (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Tsuga mertensiana</i>). The results should help federal managers in the GNLCC prioritize tree species for climate adaptation strategies. Moreover, our methods for using published data as a basis for climate vulnerability assessment can be applied within other LCCs across the US and other management units internationally."
climate contributors to forest mosaics: ecological persistence following wildfire,"It is hypothesized that climate impacts forest mosaics through dynamic ecological processes such as wildfires. However, climate-fire research has primarily focused on understanding drivers of fire frequency and area burned, largely due to scale mismatches and limited data availability. Recent datasets, however, allow for the investigation of climate influences on ecological patch metrics across broad regions independent of area burned and at finer scale. One area of particular interest is the distribution of fire refugia within wildfire perimeters. Although much recent research emphasis has been placed on high-severity patches within wildfires, unburned and low-severity patches provide critical remnant habitat and serve as seed sources to initiate colonization and succession in recently burned landscapes. These patches of persistence also may yield insights into approaches for developing fire-resilient landscapes by forest managers and communities seeking to reduce wildfire hazard. Here, we present results showing no decline in proportion of persistent patches in three study areas surrounding National Parks in the western United States, even as research and anecdotal information suggests that fires have become larger and more severe. We also show climate linkages to metrics of persistence that echo previous findings in climate-fire research, and we introduce a framework for addressing global change impacts on forest pattern more broadly. Specifically, we discuss the interactions of multiple drivers at landscape scales and the need to disaggregate relative influences using mixed methods that can address both social and ecological phenomenon."
microclimate predicts within-season distribution dynamics of montane forest birds,"Aim Climate changes are anticipated to have pervasive negative effects on biodiversity and are expected to necessitate widespread range shifts or contractions. Such projections are based upon the assumptions that (1) species respond primarily to broad-scale climatic regimes, or (2) that variation in climate at fine spatial scales is less relevant at coarse spatial scales. However, in montane forest landscapes, high degrees of microclimate variability could influence occupancy dynamics and distributions of forest species. Using high-resolution bird survey and under-canopy air temperature data, we tested the hypothesis that the high vagility of most forest bird species combined with the heterogeneous thermal regime of mountain landscapes would enable them to adjust initial settlement decisions to track their thermal niches. Location Western Cascade Mountains, Oregon, USA. Methods We used dynamic occupancy models to test the degree to which microclimate affects the distribution patterns of forest birds in a heterogeneous mountain environment. In all models we statistically accounted for vegetation structure, vegetation composition and potential biases due to imperfect detection of birds. We generated spatial predictions of forest bird distributions in relation to microclimate and vegetation structure. Results Fine-scale temperature metrics were strong predictors of bird distributions; effects of temperature on within-season occupancy dynamics were as large or larger (1-1.7 times) than vegetation effects. Most species (86.7%) exhibited apparent within-season occupancy dynamics. However, species were almost as likely to be warm associated (i. e., apparent settlement at warmer sites and/or vacancy at cooler sites; 53.3% of species) as cool associated (i. e., apparent settlement at cooler sites and/or vacancy at warmer sites; 46.7% of species), suggesting that microclimate preferences are species specific. Main conclusions High-resolution temperature data increase the quality of predictions about avian distribution dynamics and should be included in efforts to project future distributions. We hypothesize that microclimate-associated distribution patterns may reflect species' potential for behavioural buffering from climate change in montane forest environments."
"application of a hybrid forest growth model to evaluate climate change impacts on productivity, nutrient cycling and mortality in a montane forest ecosystem","Climate change introduces considerable uncertainty in forest management planning and outcomes, potentially undermining efforts at achieving sustainable practices. Here, we describe the development and application of the FORECAST Climate model. Constructed using a hybrid simulation approach, the model includes an explicit representation of the effect of temperature and moisture availability on tree growth and survival, litter decomposition, and nutrient cycling. The model also includes a representation of the impact of increasing atmospheric CO<sub xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">2</sub> on water use efficiency, but no direct CO<sub xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">2</sub> fertilization effect. FORECAST Climate was evaluated for its ability to reproduce the effects of historical climate on Douglas-fir and lodgepole pine growth in a montane forest in southern British Columbia, Canada, as measured using tree ring analysis. The model was subsequently used to project the long-term impacts of alternative future climate change scenarios on forest productivity in young and established stands. There was a close association between predicted sapwood production and measured tree ring chronologies, providing confidence that model is able to predict the relative impact of annual climate variability on tree productivity. Simulations of future climate change suggest a modest increase in productivity in young stands of both species related to an increase in growing season length. In contrast, results showed a negative impact on stemwood biomass production (particularly in the case of lodgepole pine) for established stands due to increased moisture stress mortality."
influence of winter season climate variability on snow-precipitation ratio in the western united states,"In the western United States, climate warming poses a unique threat to water and snow hydrology because much of the snowpack accumulates at temperatures near 0������C. As the climate continues to warm, much of the region's precipitation is expected to switch from snow to rain, causing flashier hydrographs, earlier inflow to reservoirs, and reduced spring and summer snowpack. This study investigates historical variability in snow to precipitation proportion (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">S</i><sub xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">f</sub>) and maps areas in the western United States that have demonstrated higher <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">S</i><sub xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">f</sub> sensitivity to warming in the past. Projected changes in <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">S</i><sub xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">f</sub> under 1.1, 1.8, and 3.0������C future warming scenarios are presented in relation to historical variability and sensitivity. Our findings suggest that <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">S</i><sub xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">f</sub> in this region has primarily varied based on winter temperature rather than precipitation. The difference in <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">S</i><sub xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">f</sub> between cold and warm winters at low- and mid-elevations during 1916-2003 ranged from 31% in the Pacific Northwest to 40% in the California Sierra Nevada. In contrast, the difference in <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">S</i><sub xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">f</sub> between wet and dry winters was statistically not significant.

how will climate change affect wildland fire severity in the western us?,"Fire regime characteristics in North America are expected to change over the next several decades as a result of anthropogenic climate change. Although some fire regime characteristics (e.g., area burned and fire season length) are relatively well-studied in the context of a changing climate, fire severity has received less attention. In this study, we used observed data from 1984 to 2012 for the western United States (US) to build a statistical model of fire severity as a function of climate. We then applied this model to several (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">n</i>=20) climate change projections representing mid-century (2040-2069) conditions under the RCP 8.5 scenario. Model predictions suggest widespread reduction in fire severity for large portions of the western US. However, our model implicitly incorporates climate-induced changes in vegetation type, fuel load, and fire frequency. As such, our predictions are best interpreted as a <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">potential</i> reduction in fire severity, a potential that may not be realized due human-induced disequilibrium between plant communities and climate. Consequently, to realize the reductions in fire severity predicted in this study, land managers in the western US could facilitate the transition of plant communities towards a state of equilibrium with the emerging climate through means such as active restoration treatments (e.g., mechanical thinning and prescribed fire) and passive restoration strategies like managed natural fire (under suitable weather conditions). Resisting changes in vegetation composition and fuel load via activities such as aggressive fire suppression will amplify disequilibrium conditions and will likely result in increased fire severity in future decades because fuel loads will increase as the climate warms and fire danger becomes more extreme. The results of our study provide insights to the pros and cons of resisting or facilitating change in vegetation composition and fuel load in the context of a changing climate."
area burned in alpine treeline ecotones reflects region-wide trends,"The direct effects of climate change on alpine treeline ecotones - the transition zones between subalpine forest and non-forested alpine vegetation - have been studied extensively, but climate-induced changes in disturbance regimes have received less attention. To determine if recent increases in area burned extend to these higher-elevation landscapes, we analysed wildfires from 1984-2012 in eight mountainous ecoregions of the Pacific Northwest and Northern Rocky Mountains. We considered two components of the alpine treeline ecotone: subalpine parkland, which extends upward from subalpine forest and includes a fine-scale mosaic of forest and non-forested vegetation; and non-forested alpine vegetation. We expected these vegetation types to burn proportionally less than the entire ecoregion, reflecting higher fuel moisture and longer historical fire rotations. In four of eight ecoregions, the proportion of area burned in subalpine parkland (3%-8%) was greater than the proportion of area burned in the entire ecoregion (2%-7%). In contrast, in all but one ecoregion, a small proportion (���������4%) of the alpine vegetation burned. Area burned regionally was a significant predictor of area burned in subalpine parkland and alpine, suggesting that similar climatic drivers operate at higher and lower elevations or that fire spreads from neighbouring vegetation into the alpine treeline ecotone."
adaptation of lodgepole pine and interior spruce to climate: implications for reforestation in a warming world,"We investigated adaptation to climate in populations of two widespread tree species across a range of contrasting environments in western Canada. In a series of common garden experiments, bud phenology, cold hardiness, and seedling growth traits were assessed for 254 populations in the interior spruce complex (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Picea glauca</i>, <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">P. engelmannii</i>, and their hybrids) and for 281 populations of lodgepole pine (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Pinus contorta</i>). Complex multitrait adaptations to different ecological regions such as boreal, montane, coastal, and arid environments accounted for 15-20% of the total variance. This population differentiation could be directly linked to climate variables through multivariate regression tree analysis. Our results suggest that adaptation to climate does not always correspond linearly to temperature gradients. For example, opposite trait values (e.g., early versus late budbreak) may be found in response to apparently similar cold environments (e.g., boreal and montane). Climate change adaptation strategies may therefore not always be possible through a simple shift of seed sources along environmental gradients. For the two species in this study, we identified a relatively small number of uniquely adapted populations (11 for interior spruce and nine for lodgepole pine) that may be used to manage adaptive variation under current and expected future climates."
"community structure, biodiversity, and ecosystem services in treeline whitebark pine communities: potential impacts from a non-native pathogen","Whitebark pine (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Pinus albicaulis</i>) has the largest and most northerly distribution of any white pine (Subgenus <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Strobus</i>) in North America, encompassing 18������ latitude and 21������ longitude in western mountains. Within this broad range, however, whitebark pine occurs within a narrow elevational zone, including upper subalpine and treeline forests, and functions generally as an important keystone and foundation species. In the Rocky Mountains, whitebark pine facilitates the development of krummholz conifer communities in the alpine-treeline ecotone (ATE), and thus potentially provides capacity for critical ecosystem services such as snow retention and soil stabilization. The invasive, exotic pathogen <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Cronartium ribicola</i>, which causes white pine blister rust, now occurs nearly rangewide in whitebark pine communities, to their northern limits. Here, we synthesize data from 10 studies to document geographic variation in structure, conifer species, and understory plants in whitebark pine treeline communities, and examine the potential role of these communities in snow retention and regulating downstream flows. Whitebark pine mortality is predicted to alter treeline community composition, structure, and function. Whitebark pine losses in the ATE may also alter response to climate warming. Efforts to restore whitebark pine have thus far been limited to subalpine communities, particularly through planting seedlings with potential blister rust resistance. We discuss whether restoration strategies might be appropriate for treeline communities."
relative abundance and functional role of whitebark pine at treeline in the northern rocky mountains,"Facilitative interactions among plant species enable plant community development under stressful environmental conditions. Previous studies in two treeline communities within the alpine-treeline ecotone on the Rocky Mountain Front in northwestern Montana, U.S.A., indicated that whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis) serves as the majority tree island initiator, thus facilitating the development of tree islands (Resler and Tomback, 2008). However, 33.7% of whitebark pine at these treeline study sites were infected by the introduced pathogen Cronartium ribicola, which causes white pine blister rust. We examined the prevalence of whitebark pine, its ecological role, and the incidence of blister rust within two study sites, Tibbs Butte and Wyoming Creek, to the south on the Beartooth Plateau, and within two study sites, Stanley Glacier and Gibbon Pass, to the north in Kootenay and Banff National Parks, for comparison with information from the Rocky Mountain Front (Resler and Tomback, 2008). We found that whitebark pine was an important component of treeline communities in both the southern and northern study areas, although its abundance and ecological role varied with study site. Nearly half the solitary trees sampled overall in the northern and southern study areas were whitebark pine. Whitebark pine was also the most frequently occurring conifer species among tree islands at three of the four study sites. Across all study sites, whitebark pine served as tree island initiator for 29.4% of the tree islands sampled, but was a more frequent initiator within two study sites. Blister rust incidence for the Wyoming Creek study site in the southern study area was 7.7%, and for the Stanley Glacier study site in the northern study area, 16.2%. Damage and mortality over time from Cronartium ribicola will diminish the current ecological role of whitebark pine as a facilitator of landscape vegetation pattern development and may confound predictions of upward movement of treeline in response to climate warming."
a new method comparing snowmelt timing with annual area burned,"The interactions between climate and wildland fire are complex. To better understand these interactions, we used ArcMap 10.2.2 to examine the relationships between early spring snowmelt and total annual area burned within a defined region of the Rocky Mountains of the western United States. Our research methods used Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) fire perimeter data and weekly snow extent provided by the Rutgers Global Snow Lab analysis of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) daily snow maps. Our results indicated a significant correlation between early spring snowmelt and total annual area burned (P = 0.0497), providing further evidence that snowmelt timing may be a driving factor for wildland fires. This project builds on the findings of previous studies and provides a novel method for making general predictions about the upcoming fire season months in advance, using freely available remotely sensed data in real time. Further research should apply our model to a broader geographic area, and incorporate higher resolution snowmelt timing data."
seedling regeneration in the alpine treeline ecotone: comparison of wood microsites and adjacent soil substrates,"Although climate warming is generally expected to facilitate upward advance of forests, conifer seedling regeneration and survival may be hindered by low substrate moisture, high radiation, and both low and high snow accumulation. To better understand substrate-related factors promoting regeneration in the alpine treeline ecotone, this study compared 2 substrates supporting conifer seedlings: rotten downed wood and adjacent soil. Study locations, each with 3 levels of incoming radiation, were randomly selected at forest line-alpine meadow borders in Pacific Northwest wilderness areas extending along an east-west precipitation gradient. Associations among substrate type, seedling density, radiation, site moisture, site temperature, plant water potential, and plant stomatal conductance were assessed. Wood microsites, flush with the ground and supporting <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Abies</i> spp. conifer seedlings, extended up to 20 m into alpine meadows from the forest line. Although wood microsites thawed later in the spring and froze earlier in the fall, they had warmer summer temperatures, greater volumetric water content, and more growing degree hours, and seedlings growing on wood had higher water potentials than seedlings growing on adjacent soil. At drier eastern sites, there was a positive relationship between seedling density and volumetric water content. Further, there was a positive relationship between seedling stomatal conductance and volumetric water content. Our study indicates that in the Pacific Northwest. and likely elsewhere, seedlings benefit from wood microsites, which provide greater water content. Given predictions of increased summer drought in some locations globally, wood microsites at forest line-alpine meadows and forest line-grasslands borders may become increasingly important for successful conifer regeneration."
capturing subregional variability in regional-scale climate change vulnerability assessments of natural resources,"Natural resource vulnerability to climate change can depend on the climatology and ecological conditions at a particular site. Here we present a conceptual framework for incorporating spatial variability in natural resource vulnerability to climate change in a regional-scale assessment. The framework was implemented in the first regional-scale vulnerability assessment conducted by the US Forest Service. During this assessment, five subregional workshops were held to capture variability in vulnerability and to develop adaptation tactics. At each workshop, participants answered a questionnaire to: (1) identify species, resources, or other information missing from the regional assessment, and (2) describe subregional vulnerability to climate change. Workshop participants divided into six resource groups; here we focus on wildlife resources. Participants identified information missing from the regional assessment and multiple instances of subregional variability in climate change vulnerability. We provide recommendations for improving the process of capturing subregional variability in a regional vulnerability assessment. We propose a revised conceptual framework structured around pathways of climate influence, each with separate rankings for exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. These revisions allow for a quantitative ranking of species, pathways, exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity across subregions. Rankings can be used to direct the development and implementation of future regional research and monitoring programs. The revised conceptual framework is equally applicable as a stand-alone model for assessing climate change vulnerability and as a nested model within a regional assessment for capturing subregional variability in vulnerability."
montane meadows as indicators of environmental change,"We used a time series of satellite multispectral imagery for mapping and monitoring six classes of montane meadows arrayed along a moisture gradient (from hydric to mesic to xeric). The research was conducted in the Gallatin National Forest and the northwest corner of Yellowstone National Park, Montana, USA. We hypothesized that mesic meadows would support the highest species diversity of plants, birds, and butterflies because they are more moderate environments. We also hypothesized that mesic meadows would exhibit the greatest seasonal and interannual variability in spectral response across years. Field sampling in each of the meadow types was conducted for plants, birds, and butterflies in 1997 and 1998. Mesic meadows supported the highest plant species diversity, but there was no significant difference in bird or butterfly species diversity among meadow types. These data show that it may be easier to detect significant differences in more species rich taxa (e.g., plants) than taxa that are represented by fewer species (e.g., butterflies and birds). Mesic meadows also showed the greatest seasonal and interannual variability in spectral response. Given the rich biodiversity of mesic montane meadows and their sensitivity to variations in temperature and moisture, they may be important to monitor in the context of environmental change."
taking the pulse of mountains: ecosystem responses to climatic variability,"An integrated program of ecosystem modeling and field studies in the mountains of the Pacific Northwest (U.S.A.) has quantified many of the ecological processes affected by climatic variability. Paleoecological and contemporary ecological data in forest ecosystems provided model parameterization and validation at broad spatial and temporal scales for tree growth, tree regeneration and treeline movement. For subalpine tree species, winter precipitation has a strong negative correlation with growth; this relationship is stronger at higher elevations and west-side sites (which have more precipitation). Temperature affects tree growth at some locations with respect to length of growing season (spring) and severity of drought at drier sites (summer). Furthermore, variable but predictable climate-growth relationships across elevation gradients suggest that tree species respond differently to climate at different locations, making a uniform response of these species to future climatic change unlikely. Multi-decadal variability in climate also affects ecosystem processes. Mountain hemlock growth at high-elevation sites is negatively correlated with winter snow depth and positively correlated with the winter Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) index. At low elevations, the reverse is true. Glacier mass balance and fire severity are also linked to PDO. Rapid establishment of trees in subalpine ecosystems during this century is increasing forest cover and reducing meadow cover at many subalpine locations in the western U.S.A. and precipitation (snow depth) is a critical variable regulating conifer expansion. Lastly, modeling potential future ecosystem conditions suggests that increased climatic variability will result in increasing forest fire size and frequency, and reduced net primary productivity in drier, east-side forest ecosystems. As additional empirical data and modeling output become available, we will improve our ability to predict the effects of climatic change across a broad range of climates and mountain ecosystems in the northwestern U.S.A."
the relative influences of climate and competition on tree growth along montane ecotones in the rocky mountains,"Distribution shifts of tree species are likely to be highly dependent upon population performance at distribution edges. Understanding the drivers of aspects of performance, such as growth, at distribution edges is thus crucial to accurately predicting responses of tree species to climate change. Here, we use a Bayesian model and sensitivity analysis to partition the effects of climate and crowding, as a metric of competition, on radial growth of three dominant conifer species along montane ecotones in the Rocky Mountains. These ecotones represent upper and lower distribution edges of two species, and span the distribution interior of the third species. Our results indicate a greater influence of climate (i.e., temperature and precipitation) than crowding on radial growth. Competition importance appears to increase towards regions of more favorable growing conditions, and precise responses to crowding and climate vary across species. Overall, our results suggest that climate will likely be the most important determinant of changes in tree growth at distribution edges of these montane conifers in the future."
"long-term interactions of climate, productivity, species richness, and growth form in relictual sagebrush steppe plant communities","Vegetation trends due to climatic changes are difficult to separate from disturbances caused by varying land uses. To separate climatic influences from livestock grazing and fire disturbances within sagebrush steppe, we compared vegetation structure and productivity during 2 periods (10-year sequences of data from the late 1950s to the late 1960s and 3 years in the early 1990s) at 12 stands within 3 relict areas in or near the Great Rift of southern Idaho. Year-to-year fluctuations in annual net aboveground phytomass accumulation (ANAPA) were considerable in response to varying climate during both periods. More importantly, an apparently significant increase in ANAPA was observed during the latter study period. However, this apparent increase may have been due to the unusually wet conditions of 1993. Throughout both study periods, ANAPA was even more positively correlated with species richness than with precipitation, although both influences were statistically significant. Aggregation of these data by plant growth forms showed that shrubs, particularly sagebrushes, have progressively increased their proportion relative to herbaceous understorey. This directional (successional) change in the proportional contributions of growth forms to ANAPA was probably due more to long-term absence of fire at these isolated locations than to any detectable climate change or lack of grazing. This finding reduces our confidence in the use of such areas as reference sites for monitoring or as living examples for restoration efforts, but it does increase our understanding of vegetation dynamics within sagebrush steppe."
"climate, hydrologic disturbance, and succession: drivers of floodplain pattern","Floodplains are among the world's most threatened ecosystems due to the pervasiveness of dams, levee systems, and other modifications to rivers. Few unaltered floodplains remain where we may examine their dynamics over decadal time scales. Our study provides a detailed examination of landscape change over a 60-year period (1945-2004) on the Nyack floodplain of the Middle Fork of the Flathead River, a free-flowing, gravel-bed river in northwest Montana, USA. We used historical aerial photographs and airborne and satellite imagery to delineate habitats (i.e., mature forest, regenerative forest, water, cobble) within the floodplain. We related changes in the distribution and size of these habitats to hydrologic disturbance and regional climate. Results show a relationship between changes in floodplain habitats and annual flood magnitude, as well as between hydrology and the cooling and warming phases of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). Large magnitude floods and greater frequency of moderate floods were associated with the cooling phases of the PDO, resulting in a floodplain environment dominated by extensive restructuring and regeneration of floodplain habitats. Conversely, warming phases of the PDO corresponded with decreases in magnitude, duration, and frequency of critical flows, creating a floodplain environment dominated by late successional vegetation and low levels of physical restructuring. Over the 60-year time series, habitat change was widespread throughout the floodplain, though the relative abundances of the habitats did not change greatly. We conclude that the long- and short-term interactions of climate, floods, and plant succession produce a shifting habitat mosaic that is a fundamental attribute of natural floodplain ecosystems."
risk effects in elk: sex-specific responses in grazing and browsing due to predation risk from wolves,"Risk effects in ungulates are poorly understood but have recently been implicated as an important driver of elk (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Cervus elaphus</i>) population dynamics since wolves were reintroduced into the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE) of Montana and Wyoming, USA. From December to May in 2004, 2005, and 2006, we recorded the daily presence of wolves on 3 sites occupied by the Upper Gallatin elk population in the northwest corner of the GYE. We estimated the proportion of grasses, conifers, evergreen shrubs, and woody stems in 980 elk fecal samples collected from those 3 sites and tested whether wolf presence affected elk diets. The winter of 2005 was extremely mild allowing us the opportunity to investigate how elk-wolf interactions might change if winter snowpack continues to decline in western North America due to global warming. Snow accumulation consistently favored browsing, and diets during the mild winter were dominated by grass, very similar to the spring diet. In normal winters, adult males grazed less than adult females except when wolves were near because females decreased grazing in response to wolves. Adult males decreased browsing on conifers by half whereas adult females doubled conifer browsing on days when wolves were near. Overall, the sexes had different diets when wolves were absent but showed strong overlap when wolves were present. Diet shifts due to wolves may be causing trophic cascades that have gone unrecognized and probably carry nutritional consequences for wintering elk."
"multi-season climate synchronized historical fires in dry forests (1650-1900), northern rockies, usa","Our objective was to infer the climate drivers of regionally synchronous fire years in dry forests of the U.S. northern Rockies in Idaho and western Montana. During our analysis period (1650-1900), we reconstructed fires from 9245 fire scars on 576 trees (mostly ponderosa pine, <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Pinus ponderosa</i> P. &amp; C. Lawson) at 21 sites and compared them to existing tree-ring reconstructions of climate (temperature and the Palmer Drought Severity Index [PDSI]) and large-scale climate patterns that affect modern spring climate in this region (El Ni������o-Southern Oscillation [ENSO] and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation [PDO]). We identified 32 regional-fire years as those with five or more sites with fire. Fires were remarkably widespread during such years, including one year (1748) in which fires were recorded at 10 sites across what are today seven national forests plus one site on state land. During regional-fire years, spring-summers were significantly warm and summers were significantly warm-dry whereas the opposite conditions prevailed during the 99 years when no fires were recorded at any of our sites (no-fire years). Climate in prior years was not significantly associated with regional- or no-fire years. Years when fire was recorded at only a few of our sites occurred under a broad range of climate conditions, highlighting the fact that the regional climate drivers of fire are most evident when fires are synchronized across a large area. No-fire years tended to occur during La Ni������a years, which tend to have anomalously deep snowpacks in this region. However, ENSO was not a significant driver of regional-fire years, consistent with the greater influence of La Ni������a than El Ni������o conditions on the spring climate of this region. PDO was not a significant driver of past fire, despite being a strong driver of modern spring climate and modern regional-fire years in the northern Rockies."
"multi-season climate synchronized forest fires throughout the 20th century, northern rockies, usa","We inferred climate drivers of 20th-century years with regionally synchronous forest fires in the U.S. northern Rockies. We derived annual fire extent from an existing fire atlas that includes 5038 fire polygons recorded from 12 070 086 ha, or 71% of the forested land in Idaho and Montana west of the Continental Divide. The 11 regional-fire years, those exceeding the 90th percentile in annual fire extent from 1900 to 2003 (&gt;102 314 ha or ���������1% of the fire atlas recording area), were concentrated early and late in the century (six from 1900 to 1934 and five from 1988 to 2003). During both periods, regional-fire years were ones when warm springs were followed by warm, dry summers and also when the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) was positive. Spring snowpack was likely reduced during warm springs and when PDO was positive, resulting in longer fire seasons. Regional-fire years did not vary with El Ni������o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) or with climate in antecedent years. The long mid-20th century period lacking regional-fire years (1935-1987) had generally cool springs, generally negative PDO, and a lack of extremely dry summers; also, this was a period of active fire suppression. The climate drivers of regionally synchronous fire that we inferred are congruent with those of previous centuries in this region, suggesting a strong influence of spring and summer climate on fire activity throughout the 20th century despite major land-use change and fire suppression efforts. The relatively cool, moist climate during the mid-century gap in regional-fire years likely contributed to the success of fire suppression during that period. In every regional-fire year, fires burned across a range of vegetation types. Given our results and the projections for warmer springs and continued warm, dry summers, forests of the U.S. northern Rockies are likely to experience synchronous, large fires in the future."
american kestrel reproduction in southwestern idaho: annual variation and long-term trends,"We monitored American Kestrels (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Falco sparverius</i>) nesting in boxes from 1986-2006 in southwestern Idaho. The number of boxes available to kestrels each year varied from 34 to 126. Approximately 20% of boxes were on highway signs along Interstate 84, 20% were on trees in rural residential properties, and 60% were on wooden poles in rangeland, irrigated agricultural, and exurban areas. Occupancy rates increased over the 21-year period, despite increasing human populations, housing developments, and vehicular traffic near the boxes. The percent of boxes occupied each year averaged 48������14, and the percent of nesting attempts that raised young to 22 d old averaged 64������10. Clutch size averaged 4.8 and exhibited no significant trend over time. Nesting success and productivity also showed no trends over time. Mean number of young fledged by kestrel pairs each year ranged from 1.3 to 3.5 and averaged 2.6. Brood sizes at successful boxes averaged 4.0. Nests in boxes on trees near farmsteads and in boxes on interstate highway signs were less successful than nests in boxes on poles in less-inhabited areas, suggesting that signs on interstate highways may not be optimal nesting habitat for kestrels. Kestrel nest-initiation and hatching dates became earlier during the study period, and mean winter temperatures increased significantly during the study period, suggesting a possible effect of climate change."
whitebark pine vulnerability to climate-driven mountain pine beetle disturbance in the greater yellowstone ecosystem,"Widespread outbreaks of mountain pine beetles (MPB) are occurring throughout the range of this native insect. Episodic outbreaks are a common occurrence in the beetles' primary host, lodgepole pine. Current outbreaks, however, are occurring in habitats where outbreaks either did not previously occur or were limited in scale. Herein, we address widespread, ongoing outbreaks in high-elevation, whitebark pine forests of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, where, due to an inhospitable climate, past outbreaks were infrequent and short lived. We address the basic question: are these outbreaks truly unprecedented and a threat to ecosystem continuity? In order to evaluate this question we (1) present evidence that the current outbreak is outside the historic range of variability; (2) examine system resiliency to MPB disturbance based on adaptation to disturbance and host defenses to MPB attack; and (3) investigate the potential domain of attraction to large-scale MPB disturbance based on thermal developmental thresholds, spatial structure of forest types, and the confounding influence of an introduced pathogen. We conclude that the loss of dominant whitebark pine forests, and the ecological services they provide, is likely under continuing climate warming and that new research and strategies are needed to respond to the crisis facing whitebark pine."
selection of spatial-temporal lattice models: assessing the impact of climate conditions on a mountain pine beetle outbreak,"Insects are among the most significant indicators of a changing climate. Here we evaluate the impact of temperature, precipitation, and elevation on the tree-killing ability of an eruptive species of bark beetle in pine forests of British Columbia, Canada. We consider a spatial-temporal linear regression model and in particular, a new statistical method that simultaneously performs model selection and parameter estimation. This approach is penalized maximum likelihood estimation under a spatial-temporal adaptive Lasso penalty, paired with a computationally efficient algorithm to obtain approximate penalized maximum likelihood estimates. A simulation study shows that finite-sample properties of these estimates are sound. In a case study, we apply this approach to identify the appropriate components of a general class of landscape models which features the factors that propagate an outbreak. We interpret the results from ecological perspectives and compare our method with alternative model selection procedures."
"fuel treatment impacts on estimated wildfire carbon loss from forests in montana, oregon, california, and arizona","Using forests to sequester carbon in response to anthropogenically induced climate change is being considered across the globe. A recent U.S. executive order mandated that all federal agencies account for sequestration and emissions of greenhouse gases, highlighting the importance of understanding how forest carbon stocks are influenced by wildfire. This paper reports the effects of the most common forest fuel reduction treatments on carbon pools composed of live and dead biomass as well as potential wildfire emissions from six different sites in four western U.S. states. Additionally, we predict the median forest product life spans and uses of materials removed during mechanical treatments. Carbon loss from modeled wildfire-induced tree mortality was lowest in the mechanical plus prescribed fire treatments, followed by the prescribed fire-only treatments. Wildfire emissions varied from 10-80 Mg/ha and were lowest in the prescribed fire and mechanical followed by prescribed fire treatments at most sites. Mean biomass removals per site ranged from approximately 30-60 dry Mg/ha; the median lives of products in first use varied considerably (from &lt;10 to &gt;50 years). Our research suggests most of the benefits of increased fire resistance can be achieved with relatively small reductions in current carbon stocks. Retaining or growing larger trees also reduced the vulnerability of carbon loss from wildfire. In addition, modeled vulnerabilities to carbon losses and median forest product life spans varied considerably across our study sites, which could be used to help prioritize treatment implementation."
gradient-based habitat affinities predict species vulnerability to drought,"Ecological fingerprints of climate change are becoming increasingly evident at broad geographical scales as measured by species range shifts and changes in phenology. However, finer-scale species-level responses to environmental fluctuations may also provide an important bellwether of impending future community responses. Here we examined changes in abundance of butterfly species along a hydrological gradient of six montane meadow habitat types in response to drought. Our data collection began prior to the drought, and we were able to track changes for 11 years, of which eight were considered mild to extreme drought conditions. We separated the species into those that had an affinity for hydric vs. xeric habitats. We suspected that drought would favor species with xeric habitat affinities, but that there could be variations in species-level responses along the hydrological gradient. We also suspected that mesic meadows would be most sensitive to drought conditions. Temporal trajectories were modeled for both species groups (hydric vs. xeric affinity) and individual species. Abundances of species with affinity for xeric habitats increased in virtually all meadow types. Conversely, abundances of species with affinity for hydric habitats decreased, particularly in mesic and xeric meadows. Mesic meadows showed the most striking temporal abundance trajectory: Increasing abundances of species with xeric habitat affinity were offset by decreasing or stable abundances of species with hydric habitat affinity. The one counterintuitive finding was that, in some hydric meadows, species with affinity for hydric habitats increased. In these cases, we suspect that decreasing moisture conditions in hydric meadows actually <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">increased</i> habitat suitability because sites near the limit of moisture extremes for some species became more acceptable. Thus, species responses were relatively predictable based upon habitat affinity and habitat location along the hydrological gradient, and mesic meadows showed the highest potential for changes in community composition. The implications of these results are that longer-term changes due to drought could simplify community composition, resulting in prevalence of species tolerant to drying conditions and a loss of species associated with wetter conditions. We contend that this application of gradient analysis could be valuable in assessing species vulnerability of other taxa and ecosystems."
"assessing the potential for pocket agriculture in mountainous regions: a case study in west kootenay, british columbia, canada","Food security is a growing concern for rural communities that rely on imported food. Increasing a region's food self-reliance is a strategy to address this concern, but is a challenge in regions with limited arable lands as a result of topographically diverse, mountain-dominated landscapes. Mechanized, large-scale agriculture relies on contiguous areas of arable land, rather than small parcels of dispersed arable soils and suitable climates. The Kootenay region of British Columbia, Canada, serves as an example of the opportunities for mountainous, rural communities to increase their food self-sufficiency by considering the potential for agriculture on small parcels of land. Soil capability survey maps that provide a biophysical assessment of arable lands were used as a basis for determining (a) the potential land base available for small-scale agriculture, and (b) the potential for niche crops that may be grown on poorer capability lands in the Kootenay region. The soil capability criteria, coupled with farm survey data, were used to measure and quantify the distribution of underutilized farmland in the region. Results indicate that up to 90 percent of land capable of agriculture and 69 percent of high quality farm land protected under the Agricultural Land Reserve is not under production for crops or pasture. Global Climate Model scenarios for 2050 indicate that the region will have a longer growing season, hotter summers, and more frost-free days, which could increase the region's capacity to grow food but might require additional water for irrigation. The assessment suggests that soil surveys based on biophysical attributes can assist mountainous regions in assessing their potential for agriculture."
multitemporal snow cover mapping in mountainous terrain for landsat climate data record development,"A multitemporal method to map snow cover in mountainous terrain is proposed to guide Landsat climate data record (CDR) development. The Landsat image archive including MSS, TM, and ETM+ imagery was used to construct a prototype Landsat snow cover CDR for the interior northwestern United States. Landsat snow cover CDRs are designed to capture snow-covered area (SCA) variability at discrete bi-monthly intervals that correspond to ground-based snow telemetry (SNOTEL) snow-water-equivalent (SWE) measurements. The June 1 bi-monthly interval was selected for initial CDR development, and was based on peak snowmelt timing for this mountainous region. Fifty-four Landsat images from 1975 to 2011 were pre-processed that included image registration, top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance conversion, cloud and shadow masking, and topographic normalization. Snow covered pixels were retrieved using the normalized difference snow index (NDSI) and unsupervised classification, and pixels having greater (less) than 50% snow cover were classified presence (absence). A normalized SCA equation was derived to independently estimate SCA given missing image coverage and cloud-shadow contamination. Relative frequency maps of missing pixels were assembled to assess whether systematic biases were embedded within this Landsat CDR. Our results suggest that it is possible to confidently estimate historical bi-monthly SCA from partially cloudy Landsat images. This multitemporal method is intended to guide Landsat CDR development for freshwater-scarce regions of the western US to monitor climate-driven changes in mountain snowpack extent."
imputing forest carbon stock estimates from inventory plots to a nationally continuous coverage,"The U.S. has been providing national-scale estimates of forest carbon (C) stocks and stock change to meet United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) reporting requirements for years. Although these currently are provided as national estimates by pool and year to meet greenhouse gas monitoring requirements, there is growing need to disaggregate these estimates to finer scales to enable strategic forest management and monitoring activities focused on various ecosystem services such as C storage enhancement. Through application of a nearest-neighbor imputation approach, spatially extant estimates of forest C density were developed for the conterminous U.S. using the U.S.'s annual forest inventory. Results suggest that an existing forest inventory plot imputation approach can be readily modified to provide raster maps of C density across a range of pools (e.g., live tree to soil organic carbon) and spatial scales (e.g., sub-county to biome). Comparisons among imputed maps indicate strong regional differences across C pools. The C density of pools closely related to detrital input (e.g., dead wood) is often highest in forests suffering from recent mortality events such as those in the northern Rocky Mountains (e.g., beetle infestations). In contrast, live tree carbon density is often highest on the highest quality forest sites such as those found in the Pacific Northwest. Validation results suggest strong agreement between the estimates produced from the forest inventory plots and those from the imputed maps, particularly when the C pool is closely associated with the imputation model (e.g., aboveground live biomass and live tree basal area), with weaker agreement for detrital pools (e.g., standing dead trees). Forest inventory imputed plot maps provide an efficient and flexible approach to monitoring diverse C pools at national (e.g., UNFCCC) and regional scales (e.g., Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation projects) while allowing timely incorporation of empirical data (e.g., annual forest inventory)."
why land planners and water managers don't talk to one another and why they should!,"Increasing evidence demonstrates that unsustainable land use practices result in human-induced drought conditions, and inadequate water supplies constrain land development in growing cities. Nonetheless, organizational barriers impair coordinated land and water management. Land planning is strongly influenced by political realities and interest groups, while water management is focused on the single-minded goal of providing reliable water for future development, often set apart from other priorities. Survey results from Portland, OR, and Phoenix, AZ, show that water managers and land planners are generally aware of the physical interconnections between land and water, but there is little cross-sector involvement in the two cities. Focusing on shared concerns about outdoor water use, climate variability, and water-sensitive urban design is a fruitful first step in integrating the practices of land planning and water management for climate adaptation and sustainable resource use."
hydrothermal assessment of temporal variability in seedbed microclimate,"The microclimatic requirements for successful seedling establishment are much more restrictive than those required for adult plant survival. The purpose of the current study was to use hydrothermal germination models and a soil energy and water flux model to evaluate intra- and interannual variability in seedbed microclimate relative to potential germination response of six perennial grasses and cheatgrass. We used a 44-yr weather record to parameterize a seedbed microclimate model for estimation of hourly temperature and moisture at seeding depth for a sandy loam soil type at the Orchard Field Test Site in southwestern Ada County, Idaho. Hydrothermal germination response was measured in the laboratory for two seed lots of cheatgrass (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Bromus tectorum</i> L.), four seed lots of bluebunch wheatgrass (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Pseudoroegneria spicata</i> [Pursh] L������ve), three seed lots of bottlebrush squirreltail (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Elymus elymoides</i> [Raf] Swezey), and one seed lot each of Sandberg bluegrass (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Poa secunda</i> J. Presl.), big squirreltail (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Elymus multisetus</i> [J.G. Smith] M.E. Jones), thickspike wheatgrass (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Elymus lanceolatus</i> [Scribn. And J.G. Smith] Gould) and Idaho fescue (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Festuca idahoensis</i> Elmer). Germination response models were developed to estimate potential germination rate for 13 subpopulations of each seed lot for every hour of the 44-yr simulation. Seedbed microclimate was assessed seasonally and for each day, month, and year, and germination rate-sum estimates integrated for a numerical index of relative site favorability for germination for each time period. The rate-sum favorability index showed a consistent pattern among seed lots for different years, and provides a relatively sensitive indicator of annual and seasonal variability in seedbed microclimate. This index could be used with field data to define minimum weather thresholds for successful establishment of alternative plant materials, in conjunction with weather forecast models for making restoration and fire-rehabilitation management decisions in the fall season, for evaluation of potential climate-change impacts on plant community trajectories, and in optimization schemes for selecting among alternative restoration/rehabilitation management scenarios."
lilies at the limit: variation in plant-pollinator interactions across an elevational range,"PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Many studies assume climatic factors are paramount in determining species' distributions, however, biotic interactions may also play a role. For example, pollinators may limit species' ranges if floral abundance or floral attractiveness is reduced at range margins, thus causing lower pollinator visitation and reduced reproductive output. METHODS: To test if pollinators influence the altitudinal distribution of <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Erythronium montanum</i> (Liliaceae) at Mount Rainier National Park, we asked whether (1) seed production in this species relies on pollinators, (2) seed production and pollen limitation is greatest at range limits, and (3) pollinator visitation rates (either overall or by individual taxonomic groups) reflect patterns of seed production and pollen limitation. RESULTS: From this three-year study, we established that this plant does rely on pollinators for fruit set and we found that pollen limitation trended toward being higher at the upper range limit in some years, but not consistently year to year. Insect visitation rates did not mirror spatial patterns of pollen limitation, but annually variable pollinator composition suggested differential importance of some pollinator taxonomic groups (specifically, bumblebees may be better pollinators than syrphid flies). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these results suggest that while pollinators are critical for the reproductive success of this high mountain wildflower, plant-pollinator interactions do not obviously drive the distribution of this species. Nonetheless, high spatio-temporal variability in range-wide plant-pollinator dynamics may complicate responses to climate change."
verbenone decreases whitebark pine mortality throughout a mountain pine beetle outbreak,"Mountain pine beetles (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) have been killing pines on millions of ha throughout the western United States since 2000. One species being affected is whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis Engelm.), a five-needle pine already experiencing a number of other threats. Whitebark pine is a keystone species providing a variety of values including watershed protection and food and habitat for wildlife. An increasingly used method of protecting pines from mountain pine beetles involves the antiaggregation pheromone verbenone, but no studies have evaluated the ability of verbenone applied annually to protect whitebark pines throughout mountain pine beetle outbreaks. We applied verbenone pouches annually for 7 years until an outbreak ended. Probabilities that whitebark pines survived through the end of the outbreak were 0.34 +/- 0.15 for control trees and 0.68 +/- 0.17 for trees treated with verbenone once per year. Evidence from a second verbenone treatment that was discontinued before the end of the outbreak suggested that applying verbenone twice, as opposed to once, per year may more effectively protect trees. Increased survival did not appear to vary with tree size (i.e., dbh). We believe increased survival of the magnitude we observed could reduce risks to threatened whitebark pine populations."
climate change in yellowstone national park: is the drought-related risk of wildfires increasing?,"The increased frequency of wildfires in the USA has become a common prediction associated with the build-up of greenhouse gases. Variations in annual wildfire data in Yellowstone National Park were compared to variations in historical climate conditions for the area. Univariate and multivariate analytical techniques reveal that (a) summer temperatures in the Park are increasing, (b) January-June precipitation levels are decreasing, and (c) variations in burn area within the Park are significantly related to the observed variations in climate. Outputs from four different general circulation model simulations for 2 ������ CO<sub xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">2</sub> were included in the analyses; model predictions for increasing aridity in the Yellowstone Park area were generally in agreement with observed trends in the historical climate records."
future climate in the yellowstone national park region and its potential impact on vegetation,"Biotic responses to future changes in global climate are difficult to project for a particular region because the responses involve processes that operate at many spatial scales. This difficulty is exacerbated in mountainous regions, where future vegetation changes are often portrayed as simple upward displacements of vegetation zones in response to warming. The scope of future responses that may occur in a mountainous area were examined by illustrating the potential distributions of selected tree taxa (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Pinus contorta, P. albicaulis, Quercus gambelii, Larix occidentalis, Pseudotsuga menziesii, Picea engelmannii, Pinus ponderosa</i> and <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Thuja plicata</i>) in the region of Yellowstone National Park, mainly in Wyoming. The output of a coarse-resolution climate model that incorporated a doubling of CO<sub xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">2</sub> concentration in the atmosphere was interpolated onto a 5-minute grid of topographically adjusted climate data. The output was also used as input into statistical relationships between the occurrence of individual taxa and climate. The simulated vegetation changes include a combination of altitudinal and directional range adjustments. The range of high-altitude species decreases, and some species become regionally extirpated. The new communities have no analogue in the present-day vegetation because they mix low-altitude montane species currently in the region with extralocal species from the northern and central Rocky Mountains and Pacific Northwest. The projected climate changes within the Yellowstone region and the individualism displayed by species in their potential range adjustments are equal or greater than the changes seen in the palaeoecologic record during previous warming intervals. Although the results support conservation strategies that include habitat connectivity, the magnitude of the changes may exceed the ability of species to adjust their ranges. The predicted patterns call into question the adequacy of current management objectives to cope with the scope of future changes."
model analysis of mountain pine beetle (coleoptera: scolytidae) seasonality,"The mountain pine beetle, <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Dendroctonus ponderosae</i> Hopkins, is a natural disturbance agent of considerable consequence in western pine forests. This economically and ecologically important insect has a strong requisite for maintaining a strict seasonality. Given this ecological requirement, it is somewhat surprising that no evidence for diapause or other physiological timing mechanism has been found. Seasonality and phenological timing for this species are apparently under direct temperature control. The consequences of direct temperature control were investigated by first constructing a computationally efficient phenology model based on previously published temperature dependent developmental data. The dynamic properties of this model were explored when subjected to observed microhabitat temperatures representing a range of thermal habitats from one region of the mountain pine beetle distribution (Idaho, USA). The consequences of global climate change on phenology and seasonality were also investigated. The results indicate that an adaptive seasonality is a natural consequence of the interaction between developmental parameters and seasonal temperatures. Although this adaptive phenology appears to be resilient to temperature fluctuations, changes in climate within the magnitude of predicted climate change under a CO<sub xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">2</sub> doubling scenario are capable of shifting a thermally hostile environment to a thermally benign environment. Similarly, increasing temperature by the same amount resulted in phenological disruption of a previously favourable thermal habitat. The implications of these results for restricting the current distribution of mountain pine beetle, and the potential for shifting distribution caused by global climate change are discussed."
physiology on a landscape scale: plant-animal interactions,"We explore in this paper how animals can be affected by variation in climate, topography, vegetation characteristics, and body size. We utilize new spatially explicit state-of-the-art models that incorporate principles from heat and mass transfer engineering, physiology, morphology, and behaviour that have been modified to provide spatially explicit hypotheses using GIS. We demonstrate how temporal and spatial changes in microclimate resulting from differences in topography and vegetation cover alter animal energetics, and behaviour. We explore the impacts of these energetic predictions on elk energetics in burned and unburned stands of conifer in winter in Yellowstone National Park, chuckwalla lizard distribution limits in North America, California Beechey Ground squirrel and Dusky Footed woodrat mass and energy requirements and activity patterns on the landscape, their predator prey interactions with a rattlesnake, <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Crotalus viridis</i>, and shifts in that food web structure due to topographic and vegetative variation. We illustrate how different scales of data/observation provide different pieces of information that may collectively define the real distributions of a species. We then use sensitivity analyses of energetic models to evaluate hypotheses about the effects of changes in core temperature (fever) global climate (increased air temperature under a global warming scenario) and vegetation cover (deforestation) on winter survival of elk, the geographic distribution of chuckwallas and the activity overlap of predator and prey species within a subset of commonly observed species in a terrestrial food web. Variation in slope and aspect affect the spatial variance in solar radiation incident on the ground, hence ground surface temperature, at the same elevation, same hourly 2 m air temperatures, and wind speeds. We illustrate visually how spatial effects and landscape heterogeneity make statistical descriptions of animal responses problematic, since multiple distributions of their responses to climate, topography, and vegetation on the landscape can yield the same descriptive statistics, especially at high (30 m) resolution. This preliminary analysis suggests that the model has far-reaching implications for hypothesis testing in ecology at a variety of spatial and temporal scales."
quantifying relationships between bird and butterfly community shifts and environmental change,"Quantifying the manner in which ecological communities respond during a time of decreasing precipitation is a first step in understanding how they will respond to longer-term climate change. Here we coupled analysis of interannual variability in remotely sensed data with analyses of bird and butterfly community changes in montane meadow communities of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Landsat satellite imagery was used to classify these meadows into six types along a hydrological gradient. The northern portion of the ecosystem, or Gallatin region, has smaller mean patch sizes separated by ridges of mountains, whereas the southern portion of the ecosystem, or Teton region, has much larger patches within the Jackson Hole valley. Both support a similar suite of butterfly and bird species. The Gallatin region showed more overall among-year variation in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) when meadow types were pooled within regions, perhaps because the patch sizes are smaller on average. Bird and butterfly communities showed significant relationships relative to meadow type and NDVI. We identified several key species that are tightly associated with specific meadow types along the hydrological gradient. Comparing taxonomic groups, fewer birds showed specific habitat affinities than butterflies, perhaps because birds are responding to differences in habitat structure among meadow types and using the landscape at a coarser scale than the butterflies. Comparing regions, the Teton region showed higher predictability of community assemblages as compared to the Gallatin region. The Gallatin region exhibited more significant temporal trends with respect to butterflies. Butterfly communities in wet meadows showed a distinctive shift along the hydrological gradient during a drought period (1997-2000). These results imply that the larger Teton meadows will show more predictable (i.e., static) species-habitat associations over the long term, but that the smaller Gallatin meadows may be an area that will exhibit the effects of global climate change faster."
the importance of biologically relevant microclimates in habitat suitability assessments,"Predicting habitat suitability under climate change is vital to conserving biodiversity. However, current species distribution models rely on coarse scale climate data, whereas fine scale microclimate data may be necessary to assess habitat suitability and generate predictive models. Here, we evaluate disparities between temperature data at the coarse scale from weather stations versus fine-scale data measured in microhabitats required for a climate-sensitive mammal, the American pika (Ochotona princeps). We collected two years of temperature data in occupied talus habitats predicted to be suitable (high elevation) and unsuitable (low elevation) by the bioclimatic envelope approach. At low elevations, talus surface and interstitial microclimates drastically differed from ambient temperatures measured on-site and at a nearby weather station. Interstitial talus temperatures were frequently decoupled from high ambient temperatures, resulting in instantaneous disparities of over 30 degrees C between these two measurements. Microhabitat temperatures were also highly heterogeneous, such that temperature measurements within the same patch of talus were not more correlated than measurements at distant patches. An experimental manipulation revealed that vegetation cover may cool the talus surface by up to 10 degrees C during the summer, which may contribute to this spatial heterogeneity. Finally, low elevation microclimates were milder and less variable than typical alpine habitat, suggesting that, counter to species distribution model predictions, these seemingly unsuitable habitats may actually be better refugia for this species under climate change. These results highlight the importance of fine-scale microhabitat data in habitat assessments and underscore the notion that some critical refugia may be counterintuitive."
carbon storage on landscapes with stand-replacing fires,"Many conifer forests experience stand-replacing wildfires, and these fires and subsequent recovery can change the amount of carbon released to the atmosphere because conifer forests contain large carbon stores. Stand-replacing fires switch ecosystems to being a net source of carbon as decomposition exceeds photosynthesis - a short-term effect (years to decades) that may be important over the next century if fire frequency increases. Over the long term (many centuries), net carbon storage through a fire cycle is zero if stands replace themselves. Therefore, equilibrium response of landscape carbon storage to changes in fire frequency will depend on how stand age distribution changes, on the carbon storage of different stand ages, and on postfire regeneration. In a case study of Yellowstone National Park, equilibrium values of landscape carbon storage were resistant to large changes in fire frequency because these forests regenerate quickly, the current fire interval is very long, the most rapid changes in carbon storage occur in the first century, and carbon storage is similar for stands of different ages. The conversion of forest to meadow or to sparser forest can have a large impact on landscape carbon storage, and this process is likely to be important for many conifer forests."
hydrologic regime and herbivory stabilize an alternative state in yellowstone national park,"A decline in the stature and abundance of willows during the 20th century occurred throughout the northern range of Yellowstone National Park, where riparian woody-plant communities are key components in multiple-trophic-level interactions. The potential causes of willow decline include climate change, increased elk browsing coincident with the loss of an apex predator, the gray wolf, and an absence of habitat engineering by beavers. The goal of this study was to determine the spatial and temporal patterns of willow establishment through the 20th century and to identify causal processes. Sampled willows established from 1917 to 1999 and contained far fewer young individuals than was predicted from a modeled stable willow population, indicating reduced establishment during recent decades. Two hydrologically distinct willow establishment environments were identified: fine-grained beaver pond sediments and coarse-grained alluvium. Willows established on beaver pond sediment earlier in time, higher on floodplain surfaces, and farther from the current stream channel than did willows on alluvial sediment. Significant linear declines from the 1940s to the 1990s in alluvial willow establishment elevation and lateral distance from the stream channel resulted in a much reduced area of alluvial willow establishment. Willow establishment was not well correlated with climate-driven hydrologic variables, but the trends were consistent with the effects of stream channel incision initiated in ca. 1950, 20-30 years after beaver dam abandonment. Radiocarbon dates and floodplain stratigraphy indicate that stream incision of the present magnitude may be unprecedented in the past two millennia. We propose that hydrologic changes, stemming from competitive exclusion of beaver by elk overbrowsing, caused the landscape to transition from a historical beaver-pond and willow-mosaic state to its current alternative stable state where active beaver dams and many willow stands are absent. Because of hydrologic changes in streams, a rapid return to the historical state may not occur by reduction of elk browsing alone. Management intervention to restore the historical hydrologic regime may be necessary to recover willows and beavers across the landscape."
recent changes in glacier area and volume within the southern canadian cordillera,"Net changes in glacier area in the region 50-51������N, 116-125������W, which includes the Columbia and Rocky Mountains (1951/52-2001) and the Coast Mountains (1964/65-2002), were determined through a comparison of historic aerial photography and contemporary Landsat 7 ETM+imagery. The volumes of individual glaciers were estimated using an empirical volume-area scaling relationship. The area of glaciers in the Coast Mountains decreased by 120������10 km<sup xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">2</sup>, or 5% of the initial ice-covered area here. The areas of glaciers in the Columbia and Rocky Mountains decreased by 20 and 6 km<sup xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">2</sup> respectively, corresponding to relative changes in total area of -5% and -15%. The estimated total ice volume loss from the whole region was 13������3 km<sup xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">3</sup>. In all parts of the study area, the relative changes in area of individual glaciers showed considerable variability, while the smallest glaciers remained essentially unchanged. This suggests that local factors unique to individual glaciers largely determine their sensitivity to climatic change, and that the very small glaciers are collectively less sensitive to such change."
declining summer flows of rocky mountain rivers: changing seasonal hydrology and probable impacts on floodplain forests,"In analyzing hydrologic consequences of climate change, we previously found declining annual discharges of rivers that drain the hydrographic apex of North America, the Rocky Mountain headwaters region for adjacent streams flowing to the Arctic, Atlantic and Pacific oceans. In this study we investigated historic changes in seasonal patterns of streamflows, by comparing mean monthly flows and analyzing cumulative hydrographs over the periods of record of about a century. We tested predictions of change due to winter and spring warming that would increase the proportion of rain versus snow, and alter snow accumulation and melt. We analyzed records from 14 free-flowing, snow-melt dominated rivers that drained relatively pristine parks and protected areas, thus avoiding the effects of river damming, flow regulation, or watershed development. The collective results indicated that: (1) winter flows (especially March) were often slightly increased, (2) spring run-off and (3) peak flows occurred earlier, and most substantially, (4) summer and early autumn flows (July-October) were considerably reduced. The greatest changes were observed for the rivers draining the east-slope of the Rocky Mountains toward the northern prairies and Hudson Bay, with late summer flow decline rates of about 0.2%/year. This would have considerable ecological impact since this is the warm and dry period when evaporative demand is maximal and reduced instream flows would reduce riparian groundwater recharge, imposing drought stress on floodplain forests. In combination with the decline in annual discharge, earlier peaks and reduced summer flows would provide chronic stress on riparian cottonwoods and willows and especially restrict seedling recruitment. We predict a loss of floodplain forests along some river reaches, the narrowing of forest bands along other reaches, and increased vulnerability of these ecosystems to other impacts including livestock grazing, encroachment of upland vegetation, and weed invasion."
"postfire changes in forest carbon storage over a 300-year chronosequence of <i xmlns=""http://wwww3.org/1999/xhtml"">pinus contorta</i>-dominated forests.","A warming climate may increase the frequency and severity of stand-replacing wildfires, reducing carbon (C) storage in forest ecosystems. Understanding the variability of postfire C cycling on heterogeneous landscapes is critical for predicting changes in C storage with more frequent disturbance. We measured C pools and fluxes for 77 lodgepole pine (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Pinus contorta</i> Dougl. ex Loud var. <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">latifolia</i> Engelm.) stands in and around Yellowstone National Park (YNP) along a 300-year chronosequence to examine how quickly forest C pools recover after a stand-replacing fire, their variability through time across a complex landscape, and the role of stand structure in this variability. Carbon accumulation after fire was rapid relative to the historical mean fire interval of 150-300 years, recovering nearly 80% of prefire C in 50 years and 90% within 100 years. Net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) declined monotonically, from 160 g C.m<sup xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">-2</sup>.yr<sup xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">-1</sup> at age 12 to 5 g C.m<sup xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">-2</sup>.yr<sup xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">-1</sup> at age 250, but was never negative after disturbance. Decomposition and accumulation of dead wood contributed little to NECB relative to live biomass in this system. Aboveground net primary productivity was correlated with leaf area for all stands, and the decline in aboveground net primary productivity with forest age was related to a decline in both leaf area and growth efficiency. Forest structure was an important driver of ecosystem C, with ecosystem C, live biomass C, and organic soil C varying with basal area or tree density in addition to forest age. Rather than identifying a single chronosequence, we found high variability in many components of ecosystem C stocks through time; a &gt;50% random subsample of the sampled stands was necessary to reliably estimate the nonlinear equation coefficients for ecosystem C. At the spatial scale of YNP, this variability suggests that landscape C develops via many pathways over decades and centuries, with prior stand structure, regeneration, and within-stand disturbance all important. With fire rotation projected to be &lt;30 years by mid century in response to a changing climate, forests in YNP will store substantially less C (at least 4.8 kg C/m<sup xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">2</sup> or 30% less)."
large carbon release legacy from bark beetle outbreaks across western united states,"Warmer conditions over the past two decades have contributed to rapid expansion of bark beetle outbreaks killing millions of trees over a large fraction of western United States (US) forests. These outbreaks reduce plant productivity by killing trees and transfer carbon from live to dead pools where carbon is slowly emitted to the atmosphere via heterotrophic respiration which subsequently feeds back to climate change. Recent studies have begun to examine the local impacts of bark beetle outbreaks in individual stands, but the full regional carbon consequences remain undocumented for the western US. In this study, we quantify the regional carbon impacts of the bark beetle outbreaks taking place in western US forests. The work relies on a combination of postdisturbance forest regrowth trajectories derived from forest inventory data and a process-based carbon cycle model tracking decomposition, as well as aerial detection survey (ADS) data documenting the regional extent and severity of recent outbreaks. We find that biomass killed by bark beetle attacks across beetle-affected areas in western US forests from 2000 to 2009 ranges from 5 to 15TgCyr(-1) and caused a reduction of net ecosystem productivity (NEP) of about 6.1-9.3TgCy(-1) by 2009. Uncertainties result largely from a lack of detailed surveys of the extent and severity of outbreaks, calling out a need for improved characterization across western US forests. The carbon flux legacy of 2000-2009 outbreaks will continue decades into the future (e.g., 2040-2060) as committed emissions from heterotrophic respiration of beetle-killed biomass are balanced by forest regrowth and accumulation."
"rural nevada and climate change: vulnerability, beliefs, and risk perception","In this article, we present the results of a study investigating the influence of vulnerability to climate change as a function of physical vulnerability, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity on climate change risk perception. In 2008/2009, we surveyed Nevada ranchers and farmers to assess their climate change-related beliefs, and risk perceptions, political orientations, and socioeconomic characteristics. Ranchers' and farmers' sensitivity to climate change was measured through estimating the proportion of their household income originating from highly scarce water-dependent agriculture to the total income. Adaptive capacity was measured as a combination of the Social Status Index and the Poverty Index. Utilizing water availability and use, and population distribution GIS databases; we assessed water resource vulnerability in Nevada by zip code as an indicator of physical vulnerability to climate change. We performed correlation tests and multiple regression analyses to examine the impact of vulnerability and its three distinct components on risk perception. We find that vulnerability is not a significant determinant of risk perception. Physical vulnerability alone also does not impact risk perception. Both sensitivity and adaptive capacity increase risk perception. While age is not a significant determinant of it, gender plays an important role in shaping risk perception. Yet, general beliefs such as political orientations and climate change-specific beliefs such as believing in the anthropogenic causes of climate change and connecting the locally observed impacts (in this case drought) to climate change are the most prominent determinants of risk perception."
"climate change perception, observation and policy support in rural nevada: a comparative analysis of native americans, non-native ranchers and farmers and mainstream america","As climate change research burgeons at a remarkable pace, it is intersecting with research regarding indigenous and rural people in fascinating ways. Yet, there remains a significant gap in integrated quantitative and qualitative methods for studying rural climate change perception and policy support, especially with regard to Native Americans. The objectives of this paper are to utilize our multi-method approach of integrating surveys, interviews, video, literature and fieldwork in innovative ways to: (1) address the aforementioned gap in rural studies, while advancing knowledge regarding effective methodologies for investigation of linkages between socio-political variables and climate change perceptions; and (2) perform comparative primary research regarding the climate change assumptions, risk perceptions, policy preferences, observations and knowledge among rural Nevada's tribes and tribal environmental leaders, non-native ranchers and farmers, and America's general public. The results of this study have ramifications for similar populations in arid and semi-arid lands, particularly in the U.S. Southwest."
spatial variability in tree regeneration after wildfire delays and dampens future bark beetle outbreaks,"Climate change is altering the frequency and severity of forest disturbances such as wildfires and bark beetle outbreaks, thereby increasing the potential for sequential disturbances to interact. Interactions can amplify or dampen disturbances, yet the direction and magnitude of future disturbance interactions are difficult to anticipate because underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. We tested how variability in postfire forest development affects future susceptibility to bark beetle outbreaks, focusing on mountain pine beetle (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Dendroctonus ponderosae</i>) and Douglas-fir beetle (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Dendroctonus pseudotsugae</i>) in forests regenerating from the large high-severity fires that affected Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming in 1988. We combined extensive field data on postfire tree regeneration with a well-tested simulation model to assess susceptibility to bark beetle outbreaks over 130 y of stand development. Despite originating from the same fire event, among-stand variation in forest structure was very high and remained considerable for over a century. Thus, simulated emergence of stands susceptible to bark beetles was not temporally synchronized but was protracted by several decades, compared with stand development from spatially homogeneous regeneration. Furthermore, because of fire-mediated variability in forest structure, the habitat connectivity required to support broad-scale outbreaks and amplifying cross-scale feedbacks did not develop until well into the second century after the initial burn. We conclude that variability in tree regeneration after disturbance can dampen and delay future disturbance by breaking spatiotemporal synchrony on the landscape. This highlights the importance of fostering landscape variability in the context of ecosystem management given changing disturbance regimes."
"disturbance, equilibrium, and environmental variability: what is 'natural' vegetation in a changing environment?","The concept of 'natural' ecosystems is discussed with particular reference to North American ecological ideas about natural disturbance. To most early ecologists, the 'natural' ecosystem was the community that would be reached after a long period without large-scale disturbance (fire, windstorm, etc.). More recently, it has been realized that in most areas some type of large scale disturbance is indigenous, and must be included in any realistic definition of 'naturalness'. In some areas an equilibrium may exist in which patchy disturbance is balanced by regrowth, but in others equilibrium may be impossible because (1) individual disturbances are too large or infrequent, (2) ephemeral events have long-lasting disruptive effects, and/or (3) climate changes interrupt any movement toward equilibrium that does occur. Examples of non-equilibrium ecosystems include the East African savannas, the Big Woods of Minnesota, the lodgepole pine (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Pinus contorta </i>var. <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">latifolia</i>) forests of Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, and possibly the old-growth Douglas fir (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Pseudotsuga menziesii</i>) forests of the Pacific Northwest. Where an equilibrium does not exist, defining the 'natural' vegetation becomes much more difficult, because the vegetation in any given area would not be stable over long periods of time even without man's influence. In many areas it may be unrealistic to try to define the natural vegetation for a site; there are often several communities that could be the 'natural' vegetation for any given site at any given time."
effects of temperature and precipitation on snowpack variability in the central rocky mountains as a function of elevation,"We employ a regression-based methodology to study the impact of temperature and precipitation on snowpack variability as a function of elevation in the Central Rocky Mountains. Because of the broad horizontal coverage and thermal heterogeneity of the measurement sites employed, we introduce an elevation correction based on the sites' climatological temperature. For the elevation range investigated (1295-2256m), and assuming an average atmospheric lapse rate of -6.5 degrees C/km, we find a mostly linear relationship between effective elevation and correlation of temperature or precipitation with snow water equivalent and snowpack duration. We estimate a threshold elevation, 1560 120m, below (above) which temperature (precipitation) is the main driver of the snowpack. This threshold elevation is robust under a range of assumed atmospheric lapse rates. Locations below this elevation are likely to be affected by projected rising temperatures, with important effects on ecosystems and economic activities dependent on snow."
relative effects of climate change and wildfires on stream temperatures: a simulation modeling approach in a rocky mountain watershed,"Freshwater ecosystems are warming globally from the direct effects of climate change on air temperature and hydrology and the indirect effects on near-stream vegetation. In fire-prone landscapes, vegetative change may be especially rapid and cause significant local stream temperature increases but the importance of these increases relative to broader changes associated with air temperature and hydrology are not well understood. We linked a spatially explicit landscape fire and vegetation model (FireBGCv2) to an empirical regression equation that predicted daily stream temperatures to explore how climate change and its impacts on fire might affect stream thermal conditions across a partially forested, mountainous landscape in the western U.S. We used the model to understand the roles that wildfire and management actions such as fuel reduction and fire suppression could play in mitigating stream thermal responses to climate change. Results indicate that air temperature increases associated with future climates could account for a much larger proportion of stream temperature increases (as much as 90 % at a basin scale) than wildfire. Similarly, land management scenarios that limited wildfire prevalence had negligible effects on future stream temperature increases. These patterns emerged at broader spatial scales because wildfires typically affected only a subset of a stream's network. However, at finer spatial and temporal scales stream temperatures were sensitive to wildfire. Although wildfires will continue to cause local, short-term effects on stream temperatures, managers of aquatic systems may need to find other solutions to cope with the larger impact from climate change on future stream warming that involves adapting to the increases while developing broad strategies for riparian vegetation restoration."
cattle grazing in semiarid forestlands: habitat selection during periods of drought,"Climate change models are predicting increased frequency and severity of droughts in arid and semiarid environments, and these areas are responsible for much of the world's livestock production. Because cattle (Bos taurus) grazing can impact the abundance, distribution, and ecological function of native plant and animal communities, it is important to understand how cattle might respond to increasingly arid conditions. Here, we evaluate changes in habitat selection by cattle across an 8-yr period as a function of rainfall and other environmental covariates. Using resource selection functions, we evaluated habitat selection based on 2 behaviors, stationary and mobile. Models revealed similarity in cattle habitat selection across years, with only modest changes in selection as a function of precipitation, despite marked seasonal and interannual differences in rainfall. Cattle preferred gentle slopes, forest edges, wet meadows, and areas near water as well as areas far from water on plateaus. Cattle avoided areas at intermediate distances from water, typically associated with steep slopes. As conditions became drier during the late season, cattle did not switch selection patterns but instead contracted their selection around water. Cattle also selected similar habitats whether they were mobile or stationary, possibly making microsite decisions therein. This consistent pattern of selection across years could be particularly problematic for riparian communities as climates become drier; however, it may also simplify cattle management, as range managers can focus vegetation monitoring efforts on riparian areas. Due to the uncertainty surrounding future climatic conditions, it is imperative that both range and wildlife managers develop long-term plans to continue managing these multiuse landscapes in an ecologically sustainable manner based on expected patterns of livestock grazing."
climate indices and mountain pine beetle-killing temperatures,"Average minimum January temperature in British Columbia and Alberta is related to the interaction of the Pacific/North American Pattern (PNA) and the Northern Annular Mode (NAM) climate indices. Average minimum temperature at a station, modified by elevation effects, determines the number of days in the month falling below threshold levels of -20 degrees C, -30 degrees C and -40 degrees C; i.e., determines the likelihood of unseasonably low temperatures that have lethal consequences for mountain pine beetle (MPB)."
sensitivity of summer stream temperatures to climate variability in the pacific northwest,"Estimating the thermal response of streams to a warming climate is important for prioritizing native fish conservation efforts. While there are plentiful estimates of air temperature responses to climate change, the sensitivity of streams, particularly small headwater streams, to warming temperatures is less well understood. A substantial body of literature correlates subannual scale temperature variations in air and stream temperatures driven by annual cycles in solar angle; however, these may be a low-precision proxy for climate change driven changes in the stream energy balance. We analyzed summer stream temperature records from forested streams in the Pacific Northwest for interannual correlations to air temperature and standardized annual streamflow departures. A significant pattern emerged where cold streams always had lower sensitivities to air temperature variation, while warm streams could be insensitive or sensitive depending on geological or vegetation context. A pattern where cold streams are less sensitive to direct temperature increases is important for conservation planning, although substantial questions may yet remain for secondary effects related to flow or vegetation changes induced by climate change."
multiscale relationships between alpine treeline elevation and hypothesized environmental controls in the western united states,"Multiple environmental factors contribute to the spatial and compositional character and elevational patterns of alpine treeline ecotones (ATEs), and the relative influence of these factors is scale dependent and spatially variable. Frameworks detailing the hierarchical structure of the ATE have been developed to characterize scale dependencies of the pattern and controls of treeline, but this topic has not been studied across a broad range of scales (e.g., from the hillslope to the region). This research directly examines scaling by comparing relationships among treeline elevations and a set of possible controls as geographic extent is varied. The data set used for this research consists of elevational data at the ATE and a set of hypothesized controls for 1,006 sites in twenty-six mountain ranges across the Western United States. The response and predictor variables are quantified from digital data sets using geographic information systems and remote sensing methodologies and then analyzed using a Mantel test framework. Results generally support, and add empirically derived detail to, existing theoretical frameworks, with climatic controls (i.e., variables characterizing temperature and precipitation) having higher correlations with ATE elevation at coarser scales and topographic variables having higher correlations at finer scales. These scale relations support the conceptual hierarchical frameworks that have been proposed, and they are useful guides of covariate selection for future ATE modeling endeavors."
what is the importance of climate model bias when projecting the impacts of climate change on land surface processes?,"Regional climate change impact (CCI) studies have widely involved downscaling and bias correcting (BC) global climate model (GCM)-projected climate for driving land surface models. However, BC may cause uncertainties in projecting hydrologic and biogeochemical responses to future climate due to the impaired spatiotemporal covariance of climate variables and a breakdown of physical conservation principles. Here we quantify the impact of BC on simulated climate-driven changes in water variables (evapotranspiration (ET), runoff, snow water equivalent (SWE), and water demand for irrigation), crop yield, biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC), nitric oxide (NO) emissions, and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) export over the Pacific Northwest (PNW) region. We also quantify the impacts on net primary production (NPP) over a small watershed in the region (HJ-Andrews). Simulation results from the coupled ECHAM5-MPI-OM model with A1B emission scenario were first dynamically downscaled to 12 km resolution with the WRF model. Then a quantile-mapping-based statistical downscaling model was used to downscale them into 1/16 degrees resolution daily climate data over historical and future periods. Two climate data series were generated, with bias correction (BC) and without bias correction (NBC). Impact models were then applied to estimate hydrologic and biogeochemical responses to both BC and NBC meteorological data sets. These impact models include a macroscale hydrologic model (VIC), a coupled cropping system model (VIC-CropSyst), an ecohydrological model (RHESSys), a biogenic emissions model (MEGAN), and a nutrient export model (Global-NEWS). Results demonstrate that the BC and NBC climate data provide consistent estimates of the climate-driven changes in water fluxes (ET, runoff, and water demand), VOCs (isoprene and monoterpenes) and NO emissions, mean crop yield, and river DIN export over the PNW domain. However, significant differences rise from projected SWE, crop yield from dry lands, and HJ-Andrews's ET between BC and NBC data. Even though BC post-processing has no significant impacts on most of the studied variables when taking PNW as a whole, their effects have large spatial variations and some local areas are substantially influenced. In addition, there are months during which BC and NBC post-processing produces significant differences in projected changes, such as summer runoff. Factor-controlled simulations indicate that BC post-processing of precipitation and temperature both substantially contribute to these differences at regional scales. We conclude that there are trade-offs between using BC climate data for offline CCI studies versus directly modeled climate data. These trade-offs should be considered when designing integrated modeling frameworks for specific applications; for example, BC may be more important when considering impacts on reservoir operations in mountainous watersheds than when investigating impacts on biogenic emissions and air quality, for which VOCs are a primary indicator."
stochastic method for examining vulnerability of hydropower generation and reservoir operations to climate change: case study of the dworshak reservoir in idaho,"Changes in air temperature and precipitation that are due to climate change can affect operational objectives and hydropower production of reservoirs. This study uses a stochastic conceptual snowmelt-runoff model to generate inflow ensembles for a wide range of potential temperature and precipitation scenarios as a means of testing which types of climate changes could adversely affect hydropower production. The method is applied to a case study of the Dworshak Reservoir on the North Fork of the Clearwater River in central Idaho. Reservoir operations in response to the climate-change ensemble scenarios were simulated using a decision support system operations model according to current operating criteria and guidelines. The magnitude and timing of hydropower generation resulting from each temperature- and precipitation-change scenario were examined, assuming no change from historical reservoir operations. Results showed that lower precipitation and higher temperature created less runoff and therefore less hydropower generation. However, increased precipitation and decreased temperature scenarios showed limited increases in hydropower production due to turbine capacity and other operational constraints. Firm hydropower production from Dworshak steadily decreased with increasing mean annual temperature and steadily increased with increasing mean annual precipitation. Timing of spring hydropower production shifted to earlier spring and winter with increasing temperature. Because these simulations did not adapt reservoir operations from historical procedures, they are not intended to be realistic predictions of changes in hydropower generation in the future. Rather, the results demonstrate how the approach can provide guidance about which types of hydrograph changes, such as shifts in inflow timing, might warrant changes in reservoir operations.

"exotic plant colonization and occupancy within riparian areas of the interior columbia river and upper missouri river basins, usa","Exotic plant invasions into riparia often result in shifts in vegetative composition, altered stream function, and cascading effects to biota at multiple scales. Characterizing the distribution patterns of exotic plants is an important step in directing targeted research to identify mechanisms of invasion and potential management strategies. In this study, we employed occupancy models to examine the associations of landscape, climate, and disturbance attributes with the colonization and occupancy patterns for spotted knapweed (Centaurea stoebe L.), Canada thistle (Cirsium arvense L., Scop.), and cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum L.) in the riparia of headwater streams (n = 1,091) in the Interior Columbia River and Upper Missouri River Basins. We found relatively low occupancy rates for cheatgrass (0.06, SE = 0.02) and spotted knapweed (0.04, SE = 0.01), but moderate occupancy of Canada thistle (0.28, SE = 0.05); colonization rates were low across all species (< 0.01). We found the distributions of spotted knapweed, Canada thistle, and cheatgrass to exhibit significant associations with both ambient climate conditions and anthropogenic and natural disturbances. We attribute the low to moderate occupancy and colonization rates to the relatively remote locations of our sample sites within headwater streams and urge consideration of means to prevent further invasions."
changes in snow mass balance in the canadian rocky mountains caused by co2 rise: regional atmosphere model results,"This study investigates snow mass balance in the Canadian Rockies under a relatively conservative Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change emission scenario for the twenty-first century through the use of regional atmosphere modelling. We dynamically downscale results from five 10-year subsets of general circulation model integrations to 6 km resolution to produce a physically consistent representation of the atmosphere at high elevations. Regional model results make evident greater warming with increasing elevation at low to mid-levels of the atmosphere, and a simple thermodynamic explanation of this process is presented. Simulated increases in atmospheric water vapour result in increases in cloud cover and precipitation at high elevations, which temporarily offset the effects of rising temperatures, but by 2100 all model elevations experience reductions in snow mass balance. A simple energy balance model produces reasonable estimates of changes in the elevation of equilibrium net snow accumulation, with increases between 185 and 197 m under an approximate 1.5 degrees C rise in surface temperatures by 2100."
"an overview of the columbia basin climate change scenarios project: approach, methods, and summary of key results","The Columbia Basin Climate Change Scenarios Project (CBCCSP) was conceived as a comprehensive hydrologic database to support climate change planning, impacts assessment, and adaptation in the Pacific Northwest (PNW) by a diverse user community with varying technical capacity over a wide range of spatial scales. The study has constructed a state-of-the-art, end-to-end data processing sequence from ""raw"" climate model output to a suite of hydrologic modelling products that are served to the user community from a web-accessible database. A calibrated 1/16 degree latitude-longitude resolution implementation of the VIC hydrologic model over the Columbia River basin was used to produce historical simulations and 77 future hydrologic projections associated with three different statistical downscaling methods and three future time periods (2020s, 2040s, and 2080s). Key products from the study include summary data for about 300 river locations in the PNW and monthly Geographic Information System products for 21 hydrologic variables over the entire study domain. Results from the study show profound changes in spring snowpack and fundamental shifts from snow and mixed-rain-and-snow to rain-dominant behaviour across most of the domain. Associated shifts in streamflow timing from spring and summer to winter are also evident in basins with significant snow accumulation in winter (for the current climate). Potential evapotranspiration increases over most of the PNW in summer because of rising temperatures; however, actual evapotranspiration is reduced in all but a few areas of the domain because evapotranspiration is mostly water limited in summer, and summer precipitation decreases in the simulations. Simulated widespread increases in soil moisture recharge in fall and winter in areas with significant snow accumulation in winter (for the current climate) support hypotheses of increased landslide risk and sediment transport in winter in the future. Simulations of floods and extreme low flows increase in intensity for most of the river sites included in the study. The largest increases in flooding are in mixed-rain-and-snow basins whose current mid-winter temperatures are within a few degrees of freezing. The CBCCSP database has been a valuable public resource that has dramatically reduced costs in a number of high-visibility studies in the PNW and western United States focused on technical coordination and planning."
effect of crown class and habitat type on climate-growth relationships of ponderosa pine and douglas-fir,"There is increasing interest in actively managing forests to increase their resilience to climate-related changes. Although forest managers rely heavily on the use of silvicultural treatments that manipulate stand structure and stand dynamics to modify responses to climate change, few studies have directly assessed the effects of stand structure or canopy position on climate-growth relationships - or examined how this relationship may vary among species or across environmental gradients. In this study, we analyzed variability in tree-ring series from 15 low-elevation stands in northeastern Washington (USA) using time series analysis and linear mixed effects models. Our objective was to assess the relative influences of species (Pinus ponderosa vs. Pseudotsuga menziesii), crown class (dominant vs. intermediate), and habitat type (Xeric vs. Dry-Mesic) on the climate responses of mature trees in unmanaged forests. We found that climate-growth relationships varied significantly between canopy classes and across habitat types but that these effects were highly species-specific. For P. menziesii, growth responses to temperature and precipitation did not vary between canopy classes. For P. ponderosa, however, regression coefficients for the relationship between temperature and radial growth were nearly twice as large for dominant trees compared to intermediate trees, and 84% of dominant trees were significantly influenced by precipitation, compared to only 62% of intermediate trees. In contrast, habitat-type did not significantly affect the climate responses of P. ponderosa, but did affect responses of P. menziesii. For example, for P. menziesii only 51% of trees in Dry-Mesic sites, were significantly affected by drought (PDSI), compared to 93% in Xeric sites. A better understanding of the relationship between climate sensitivity, species-specific hydraulic strategies, and stand dynamics is crucial for accurately predicting tree responses to climate change and designing forest treatments that will effectively reduce the climatic vulnerability of key forest species and habitats. Results may assist managers with understanding how altering stand dynamics will differentially affect climate-responses of individual species. Published by Elsevier B.V."
"climate extreme and its linkage to regional drought over idaho, usa","To investigate consequences of climate extreme and variability on agriculture and regional water resource, twenty-seven climatic indices of temperature and precipitation over Idaho, USA, were computed. Precipitation, mean temperature and maximum temperature, self-calibrated Palmer Drought Index and Standardized Precipitation Index for 1-, 3-, 6- and 12-month time scales were used to identify spatial and temporal distribution of climatic extreme and variability as well as drought frequency and magnitude. Seven oceanic indices were also used to detect teleconnections between climatic indices and regional droughts. The analyses were conducted for 56 meteorological stations, during 1962-2008, characterized by a long-term and high-quality data set. The result indicates that decreasing trends and increasing trends are identified for precipitation and temperature, respectively. Consequently, it appears that frost and ice days dwindle as growing season (May-August) length, tropical nights and summer days increase. Given current climate conditions, the results also imply that these trends will continue in the future possibly driven by uncertain climate variability. We anticipate that these indices explained by teleconnections will improve drought-forecasting capability in this region."
secondary controls of alpine treeline elevations in the western usa,"Alpine treelines can be explained by lower temperatures with increasing elevation at global scales, but regional and local treelines vary because of additional constraints. We examine data from treelines across the western USA, divided into subregions to elucidate the patterns of these other constraints. We determined the best predictor of elevation for 930 treeline sites in 26 mountain ranges by finding a climate variable with least variance. We used the variance at each site from this predictor to compute an elevation anomaly that became the dependent variable in correlation and regression analyses. We derived independent variables from digital elevation models and regional climate interpolations. A ""best subsets"" regression, which compares all possible combinations, revealed that at the continental scale, latitude and longitude stand out among many significant but weak correlations between the elevation anomaly and the other variables; these retain importance within regions. Our results show variables related to water and energy play a secondary role. We found that the division of the observations into regions and interpretation of spatial patterns within regions was necessary to interpret the relations between the potential predictor variables and the elevation anomaly."
"area change of glaciers in the canadian rocky mountains, 1919 to 2006","Glaciers in the Canadian Rocky Mountains constitute an important freshwater resource. To enhance our understanding of the influence climate and local topography have on glacier area, large numbers of glaciers of different sizes and attributes need to be monitored over periods of many decades. We used Interprovincial Boundary Commission Survey (IBCS) maps of the Alberta-British Columbia (BC) border (1903-1924), BC Terrain Resource Information Management (TRIM) data (1982-1987), and Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) imagery (2000-2002 and 2006) to document planimetric changes in glacier cover in the central and southern Canadian Rocky Mountains between 1919 and 2006. Over this period, glacier cover in the study area decreased by 590 +/- 70 km(2) (40 +/- 5 %), 17 of 523 glaciers disappeared and 124 glaciers fragmented into multiple ice masses. Glaciers smaller than 1.0 km(2) experienced the greatest relative area loss (64 +/- 8 %), and relative area loss is more variable with small glaciers, suggesting that the local topographic setting controls the response of these glaciers to climate change. Small glaciers with low slopes, low mean/median elevations, south to west aspects, and high insolation experienced the largest reduction in area. Similar rates of area change characterize the periods 1919-1985 and 1985-2001; -6.3 +/- 0.6 km(2) yr(-1) (-0.4 +/- 0.1% yr(-1)) and -5.0 +/- 0.5 km(2) yr(-1) (-0.5 +/- 0.1% yr(-1)), respectively. The rate of area loss, however, increased over the period 20012006; -19.3 +/- 2.4 km(2) yr(-1) (-2.0 +/- 0.2% yr(-1)). Applying size class-specific scaling factors, we estimate a total reduction in glacier cover in the central and southern Canadian Rocky Mountains for the period 1919-2006 of 750 km(2) (30 %)."
a landsat time series approach to characterize bark beetle and defoliator impacts on tree mortality and surface fuels in conifer forests,"Insects are important forest disturbance agents, and mapping their effects on tree mortality and surface fuels represents a critical research challenge. Although various remote sensing approaches have been developed to monitor insect impacts, most studies have focused on single insect agents or single locations and have not related observed changes to ground-based measurements. This study presents a remote sensing framework to (1) characterize spectral trajectories associated with insect activity of varying duration and severity and (2) relate those trajectories to ground-based measurements of tree mortality and surface fuels in the Cascade Range, Oregon, USA. We leverage a Landsat time series change detection algorithm (LandTrendr), annual forest health aerial detection surveys (ADS), and field measurements to investigate two study landscapes broadly applicable to conifer forests and dominant insect agents of western North America. We distributed 38 plots across multiple forest types (ranging from mesic mixed-conifer to xeric lodgepole pine) and insect agents (defoliator [western spruce budworm] and bark beetle [mountain pine beetle]). Insect effects were evident in the Landsat time series as combinations of both short- and long-duration changes in the Normalized Burn Ratio spectral index. Western spruce budworm trajectories appeared to show a consistent temporal evolution of long-duration spectral decline (loss of vegetation) followed by recovery, whereas mountain pine beetle plots exhibited both short- and long-duration spectral declines and variable recovery rates. Although temporally variable, insect-affected stands generally conformed to four spectral trajectories: short-duration decline then recovery, short- then long-duration decline, long-duration decline, long-duration decline then recovery. When comparing remote sensing data with field measurements of insect impacts, we found that spectral changes were related to cover-based estimates (tree basal area mortality R(adj)(2);= 0.40, F(1.34) = 24.76, P<0.0001] and down coarse woody detritus [R(adj)(2) = 0.29, F(1.32) = 14.72. P = 0.0006]). In contrast, ADS changes were related to count-based estimates (e.g., ADS mortality from mountain pine beetle positively correlated with ground-based counts [R(adj)(2) = 037, F(1.22) = 14.71, P= 0.0009]). Fine woody detritus and forest floor depth were not well correlated with Landsat- or aerial survey-based change metrics. By characterizing several distinct temporal manifestations of insect activity in conifer forests, this study demonstrates the utility of insect mapping methods that capture a wide range of spectral trajectories. This study also confirms the key role that satellite imagery can play in understanding the interactions among insects, fuels, and wildfire. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
influence of the pna on declining mountain snowpack in the western united states,"The widespread decrease in mountain snowpack across the Western United States is a hallmark indicator of regional climate change. Observed decreases in snowpack across lower-elevation watersheds are broadly consistent with model predictions of anthropogenic climate change; however, the magnitude of the decreases across much of the Cascades, Northern Rockies and Sierra Nevada has exceeded predictions based solely on late 20th century anthropogenic warming. To resolve the disparity between observations and predictions, the influence of intramonthly variability associated with the Pacific-North American (PNA) pattern on both the percent of precipitation falling as snow and a proxy for snowmelt during late winter is examined. The PNA is shown to have a significant influence on the elevation of the freezing level across the Western United States, with positive values of the PNA generally associated with anomalously high freezing levels. The positive tendency of the PNA during late winter over the last half-century has contributed to regional increases in the elevation of the freezing level, decreases in the percent of precipitation falling as snow, and increases in snowmelt across montane and sub-montane regions. This change in atmospheric circulation accelerated the decline in mountain snowpack predicted by anthropogenic forcing. Copyright. (C) 2010 Royal Meteorological Society"
density-dependent population dynamics of mountain pine beetle in thinned and unthinned stands,"Thinning, the selective removal of some trees from a forest, is one way forest managers can reduce the probability that a forest will be susceptible to attack by bark beetles. Although this method has been shown to be effective, it is not clear whether the effect arises when pre-outbreak populations are small or during the epidemic phase when outbreaks are growing. We adopted a population dynamics approach to determine if the effect of limit or basal area thinning could be observed in the form of differential beetle recruitment using lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud.) and ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex P. & C. Laws.) mortality data from previously published studies as a proxy measure of mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) population size. We found that mountain pine beetle populations exhibit density-dependent population dynamics that are influenced by the silvicultural history of their host's stand. Thinning did not change the epidemic equilibrium but instead caused a shift in dynamics from linear to nonlinear. In a validation test, the models developed for thinned and unthinned stands predicted reproductive rates in independent locations. These data also suggest the epidemic dynamics of mountain pine beetle may be sensitive to perturbations and to systematic trends associated with climate variability and climate change."
"effects of wildfire on stream temperatures in the bitterroot river basin, montana","Wildfire is a common natural disturbance that can influence stream ecosystems. Of particular concern are increases in water temperature during and following fires, but studies of these phenomena are uncommon. We examined effects of wildfires in 2000 on maximum water temperature for a suite of second- to fourth-order streams with a range of burn severities in the Bitterroot River basin, Montana. Despite many sites burning at high severity, there were no apparent increases in maximum water temperature during the fires. One month after fire and in the subsequent year, increases in maximum water temperatures at sites within burns were 1.4-2.2 degrees C greater than those at reference sites, with the greatest differences in July and August. Maximum temperature changes at sites >1.7 km downstream from burns did not differ from those at reference sites. Seven years after the fires, there was no evidence that maximum stream temperatures were returning to pre-fire norms. Temperature increases in these relatively large streams are likely to be long-lasting and exacerbated by climate change. These combined effects may alter the distribution of thermally sensitive aquatic species."
prescribed fire as a means of reducing forest carbon emissions in the western united states,"Carbon sequestration by forested ecosystems offers a potential climate change mitigation benefit. However, wildfire has the potential to reverse this benefit. In the western United States, climate change and land management practices have led to increases in wildfire intensity and size. One potential means of reducing carbon emissions from wildfire is the use of prescribed burning,which consumes less biomass and therefore releases less carbon to the atmosphere. This study uses a regional fire emissions model to estimate the potential reduction in fire emissions when prescribed burning is applied in dry, temperate forested systems of the western U.S. Daily carbon dioxide (CO2) fire emissions for 2001-2008 were calculated for the western U.S. for two cases: a default wildfire case and one in which prescribed burning was applied. Wide-scale prescribed fire application can reduce CO2 fire emissions for the western U.S. by 18-25% in the western U.S., and by as much as 60% in specific forest systems. Although this work does not address important considerations such as the feasibility of implementing wide-scale prescribed fire management or the cumulative emissions from repeated prescribed burning, it does provide constraints on potential carbon emission reductions when prescribed burning is used."
growth responses of three coexisting conifer species to climate across wide geographic and climate ranges in yukon and british columbia,"This work aimed to compare radial growth-climate relationships among three coexisting coniferous tree species across a wide geographic and climate range from southern British Columbia (BC) to central Yukon, Canada. Tree-ring data were collected from 20 mature stands of white spruce (Picea glauca), lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia), and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa). Linear relationships between annual growth variation and monthly and seasonal climate were quantified with correlation and regression analyses, and variation in climate-growth responses over a climatic gradient were quantified by regressing growth responses against local mean climatic conditions. Temperatures had more consistent and stronger correlations with growth for all three species than precipitation, but growth-climate responses varied among species and among sites. In particular, pine and fir populations showed different responses between BC and Yukon, whereas spruce showed a more consistent response across the study domain. Results indicate that (1) the response and sensitivity of trees to seasonal climate variables vary among species and sites and (2) winter temperatures prior to growth may have significant impacts on pine and fir growth at some sites. The capacity to adapt to climate change will likely vary among the study species and across climatic gradients, which will have implications for the future management of mixed-species forests in Yukon and BC.

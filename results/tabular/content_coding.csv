mountain glacier discharge responds to climate warming

Many studies have identiﬁed widespread declines in snowpack in western North America [Mote et al., 2005; Hamlet et al., 2005; Mote, 2006], and these changes have been linked to warming trends [Pederson et al., 2011; Kapnick and Hall, 2012; Pederson et al., 2013] and increasing freezing level elevations [Abatzoglou, 2011]. Additionally, approximately half of recent changes in western U.S. snowpack have been attributed to anthropogenic eﬀects [Pierce et al., 2008]. ",very mountain focused.

Associated shifts in streamflow timing from spring and summer to winter are also evident in basins with significant snow accumulation in winter (for the current climate). Potential evapotranspiration increases over most of the PNW in summer because of rising temperatures; however, actual evapotranspiration is reduced in all but a few areas of the domain because evapotranspiration is mostly water limited in summer, and summer precipitation decreases in the simulations. Simulated widespread increases in soil moisture recharge in fall and winter in areas with significant snow accumulation in winter (for the current climate) support hypotheses of increased landslide risk and sediment transport in winter in the future. Simulations of floods and extreme low flows increase in intensity for most of the river sites included in the study. The largest increases in flooding are in mixed-rain-and-snow basins whose current mid-winter temperatures are within a few degrees of freezing."

surface, yet they harbor a disproportionately large
number of unique species and human cultures (Price and
Butts 2000). Mountains also play an important, albeit poorly
understood, role in hydroclimatic and biogeochemical cycles
that directly or indirectly sustain the livelihood of many people
around the world (Schröter et al. 2005).  Among the
processes that continuously modify mountainscapes, land -
sliding stands out because of its severe and long-lasting negative
effects on natural and human-dominated ecosystems."" and ""There is mounting evidence that the frequency and magnitude
of landsliding is changing in many parts of the world
in response to climate change (Lateltin et al. 1997)."""
